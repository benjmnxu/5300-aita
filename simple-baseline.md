## Simple Baseline Outline

The code expects the following files (which are all in our Github repo):

```train.csv```: Training data.
```dev.csv```: Development (validation) data.

To run this script, simply run ```python simple_baseline.py```. This will also write the predicted labels to a file called ```predicted_labels_simple.txt```.
