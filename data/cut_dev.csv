2393,Not the A-hole,"Last year, my cousin (36M) moved his family from Florida to my state. He wanted to pursue a business venture with my dad and they did manage to open a successful restaurant that brings in sufficient income to afford childcare. 

I’m a high school senior(17F). I’m really busy since I have a lot of extracurriculars after school, along with handling the workload of 6 AP classes and completing all my college applications.

My cousin often drops his two sons (5M and 9M) off at my house and leave them there until 9 at night. I understand that the restaurant can be busy, but my cousin usually goes home early and take 3 hour naps before he is willing to take his kids home. On Sundays, he leaves his kids at my house and goes off to the shooting range with his friends.

The two boys are really sensitive. One time, I was wiping the younger one’s hand and he bursted into tears because he said I was hurting him even though I used no pressure. The older one is really hyper and goes into random fits of laughter/rage. He often hogs the tv, which results in the younger one throwing tantrums. They fight often and the younger one has gotten into a habit of sitting on his older brother while jumping up and down. 

I really want to tell him to bring them over less, but I also feel bad since he has work.

15074,Asshole,"Our 2 year relationship was great, but recently we drifted apart and realised we wanted different things. Neither of us can afford to move out at the moment so we decided to just be respectful and try to get through the next month or so as easily as possible. 

At first it was weird, we would still go out to eat together, sleep in the same bed, etc. It was as if nothing had changed other than our relationship status. It almost seemed that the distance that had grown between us over the last few months was no longer there. I was reinvesting myself to the idea that this might still be salvageable. We talked about it and she thought this too. 

So we got back together. 

Now, months later, it's happening again for the 3rd time and I recognize the pattern. It's not healthy for either of us to keep dragging ourselves emotionally through the mud like this, so I've told her this time I'd like to go no contact. I'll sleep on the couch, make my own meals, lead a single life essentially. I made this decision several days ago and since then she has been crying nonstop. She's asked for hugs the first couple of days and I only shake my head and walk away. Now she just cries harder everytime we're in the same room. It kills me because I want to be there for her, I just know where that path leads. 

So, am I being an asshole here? ",37,85,0.91,AITA for ignoring my ex who I still live with?,b8z9iu,2019-04-03 15:17:05,YTA,1338,AITA
19961,Not the A-hole,"This cousin of mine lives in Mexico. Him and I have NEVER met. The only reason I know of that he actually exists is my mom mentioning him. 

Found him on Facebook, his profile picture isn’t a face, but a character from a tv show? I have no idea. 

Anyways, we never interacted. Not even “liked” each other’s posts. Randomly he hits me up one day; “hey what’s up, how’s everything, how are you?” 

I dislike being a chatty person, but he’s family right? So I text back, asking him similar questions. That’s the extent of our conversations. This exact exchange occurs a couple more times over the same week. Then out of nowhere I get asked “hey, can I borrow some money?” I have a pretty difficult dilemma since 1) I JUST started working again couple of weeks ago, so don’t have much to spare bc I refuse to take money out of my savings for things like this and 2) I have lent to a cousin once prior (not the same cousin) only to never hear from him until a year or two later. 

I decide I will be the one to help out a family member. I have no idea how hard it is to live in rural mexico, so I assume he could benefit. I give him $75 (give, bc I doubt I’ll see it again). 

A week later, the EXACT same conversations begin to occur and I let my gf know that he’s gonna ask me for money again. “Don’t be so negative; he could just be wanting to build rapport.” 

Lo and behold he once again asks me for money. He insists he will pay me back in two weeks. This past week he has been asking again and again each day, nearly desperately claiming that he has late payments and they will take his motorcycle if he can’t pay. It’s not that he’s asking me that bothers me more so than thinking a family member wants to build fake rapport to mooch from me. 

I brought it up as a point of conversation when my mom called me and she told me that this particular cousin has bothered all of my uncles for money and likewise have given them all one version of a story that she later found out wasn’t true. My mother mentions that she is the only one he hasn’t tried to ask from bc my mom is pretty damn known in out family for being the most strict, extremely serious woman. This is infuriating. I don’t think I want to give him the courtesy of my response, but would I be the buttface for straight up, without explaining blocking a a family member?",14,22,0.92,WIBTA for blocking my cousin without warning on Facebook ?,h7w60m,2020-06-12 23:52:49,NTA,2335,WIBTA
15805,Everyone Sucks,"I love my MIL (and SIL who is also super into horses) to death, but this issue is really starting to bug me and my fiancé. 

We live in an area where a lot of people (mostly women) are OBSESSED with horses and riding horses and owning horses just to say they have horses and just.... horses. 

I have never been interested in that kind of thing. I can recognize that horses are a beautiful, elegant creature but I just have never gotten into it. Neither has my fiancé. He has dated girls who had horses and he just couldn’t deal with it.

We have a 13 month old daughter and my MIL is constantly talking about how she is going to get her crazy about horses and riding them and all of that. We don’t want her to. We want our daughter to be involved in more extra curricular activities like karate and baseball and soccer and the like. 

I understand that it’s a hobby. I understand that it’s loved by a lot of people, and that it isn’t hurting anybody. But what this mostly comes down to is that my MIL expects us to pay for it, and I know that is an expensive hobby because she can barely afford for her daughter to do it. I don’t want to pay for something she is insisting our daughter gets into, especially when our daughter isn’t even old enough to tell us what she wants to do. We don’t have a lot of money, just like MIL, so I would rather put this on the back burner and wait until our daughter is way older to even consider her doing it. When I told MIL this, she said we were being unfair and inconsiderate of our daughter.

15024,Not the A-hole,"TL; DR at bottom.

A friend of mine started a fund campaign to raise money for her dog's surgery in January. It was legit, not a scam. Apparently there was a terribly painful injury to the dog that was getting worse and they wanted to raise $2,000 for the surgery ASAP because their pet insurance didn't cover all of it. There weren't a ton of details about what the injury was or what the surgery was for exactly, but whatever, I gave a little bit.

Here's the AITA part: I found out through a third party that the dog didn't end up making it to surgery and had to be put down. No surgery took place; it was determined the surgery would not make a difference and they opted for euthanasia. AITA for thinking they should give the money back they raised? I didn't say anything and **I'm not going to bug a grieving family over 25 bucks**, but I just found it tacky they just kept the money meant for something specific that didn't happen.

I might have hoarding tendencies (and I don't think I realized how bad until now), and am generally lazy when it comes to cleaning. I have a 2 year old, and my boyfriend is the type to do what I ask, but doesn't go too far out of the way to do much more. He is an excellent father, and will happily do any baby things. But usually our weekly cleaning is: I do laundry 5 times a week, tidy up, pet stuff (daily), and clean up messes. He usually does baby stuff, he sweeps/mops every few weeks, does some tidying, and sometimes helps with sorting laundry.
We usually switch off on cleaning bathrooms and kitchen, though he usually does the kitchen.
Anyway, he hired a cleaning lady today and after 4 hours she charged $500 and left. I took a shower and couldn't find my toothbrush and deodorant. Weird, but $20 bucks to replace and sucks because both were fairly newish (cue freak out 1- we're too broke to replace new stuff).
I go out for a smoke and I look in one of the trash bags by the back door. I see a bra and a baby hanger (I end up buying new ones fairly often because my child has too many clothes and I lose them) (cue freak out 2- I have 6 bras).
So I spent an hour sorting through the 6 bags by the back door (the trash bin is full and tomorrow's  mission) and find an assortment of things including my ski jacket, a set of personalized oven mits my sister bought for me in Italy, a litter box scoop (and another is still missing), 2 necklaces, both of my belts, a number of baby toys (mostly bits and accessories to things), more clothes, and a number of toiletry samples.
So far none of his stuff is missing and beyond a few socks I haven't seen anything of his either.
He went to bed angry because he has to go to work in the morning, and I'm considering sleeping on the couch because I'm not sure I'll be able to go to sleep anyway.
My friends all think he paid too much, and I'm not even mad about that... I just wish my crap wasn't thrown away. And I'm going to finishing digging through trash on my day off.
TL;DR: My boyfriend and I are swap creatures and he hired a cleaning lady who threw away about $250 worth of my stuff. AITA for not being more appreciative of the gesture and freaking out?

5865,Everyone Sucks,"First off, I'm heterosexual, but I am removing gender where possible to normalize/filter sexist or gender biased responses. We'll see how that works out.

First off, I'm very lucky. I know that. My 18 month old child is happy and healthy. While I'm in the process of starting not one but two technology start ups; both my mother and my mother in law have graciously offered to split babysitting for no charge until we enroll our child in daycare.

My partner, while claiming to be appreciative has taken to being quite a drill sergeant (imo) with how child care should be administered by both of the grandma's. There has been a fair share of arguing and contention at various points in the last 12 months over how our child should be fed, put to bed, play, you get the picture... I guess I'm a little bit more lax in that if our child is happy, healthy and fed, I'm generally not going to complain unless there's a risk of some form of danger.

Fast forward to this morning. My partner has a gripe with my mother over what time and how our child is being put to bed. As you can imagine, this is not the first time this is happening, and in the strictest interpretation (regardless of what they might be) my mother has actually been following the 'rules and guidelines' set out. When my mother walked through the door this morning, my partner decided to promptly yell ""hello"" (short and kurt) and within seconds then proceeded to yell and demand from another room about twenty feet away ""This evening when I get home, we (my mother and my partner) need to sit down and discuss (my child)'s sleeping methods and timing"".


Now, in my opinion, even if this grievance needed to be aired, it didn't need to be done in this fashion. Not in the second sentence communicated for the morning, not by yelling from one room to another, not to the person who is graciously taking care of our child for the rest of the day after a one hour commute each way without pay.

In turn, I quickly responded yelling back asking my partner ""When are you going to grow up!?"".

My partner is threatening to take our child and sleep at 'home' (parents house) tonight as a result. I think this is way overblown and my partner was way out of line and needed to be put in (their) place.

To make it fair, however,  we included both sides of our families in the wedding party including his brother, SIL, and their daughter as well as my sister, BIL, and nieces. Everyone was happy and agreed to the costs of dresses, shoes, hair, etc.

Now here we are 1 year later and 1 month away from the wedding and his SIL decides to pull her daughter out because the dress is ""itchy."" His bro and SIL also pulled out of the wedding party by saying that she doesn't feel comfortable in her dress either and he won't participate if she's not.

1297,No A-holes here,"Hey Reddit, 

I haven’t been able to concentrate all day because I feel like TA but I thought I’d ask the masses. 

My husband and I both live and work in Boston and we have pretty similar work schedules, leaving plenty of time in the evenings to be together. Over the past two weeks I enrolled in intensive therapy to help with an eating disorder so I’m away for most weeknights, not getting home until 9:30. I also need to get into the office by 8 AM to be able to leave early to get to the session on time. This has led to a lot of stress and overall lack of weekly happiness on my end. 

At the same time, my husband is having a really tough time at work. It’s a myriad of the usual problems—a boss that doesn’t care, too much work, no support, etc. The biggest problem is they canned his boss so now he has the workload of two people, no promotion, and they hire new people for his team but only in their Canadian office, not the one in Boston. So he still has no help with this and it’s been nearly a year. 

Our initial plan was to meet up for lunch on the weekdays because by the time I get home from therapy I end up simply going to bed because I’ve been out for 14+ hours. This would allow me to see him at least once during the day. Unfortunately, due to his work issues he hasn’t exactly been joyous during lunch. The past couple of times we’ve met up for lunch he’s been in a HORRIBLE mood due to experiencing some issue at work, whether it's a nasty email or another new hire in the Canada office. He’s unresponsive, unenthusiastic, and the entire time I’m on the verge of tears due to his lack of interest in cheering up and just hanging out with me. 

I’m having a really difficult time dealing with his bad mood during my one hour off in the entire day, so today I told him I couldn’t get lunch because “it stresses me out so much.” It did not go over well--he's not speaking to me. I feel horrible because he doesn’t have a big support system so I am the only one he has to talk to, but I need to try to have just one hour of a genuine break in the day to get me through the next 8-9 hours without his piss-poor attitude and sulking making our lives worse.

9989,Not the A-hole,"I went out with my family for a meal and my daughter got quite unwell near the end (nothing related to the meal) so my wife took her to to the car so that she could get some fresh air and hopefully feel a bit better.


I asked for the bill and waited at the table with my other daughter for it to come. No bill. 5mins later I ask another waitress. 5 mins later no bill.


Receive a text from my wife saying we need to go, what’s taking so long. I went to the bar and asked for the bill. The girl on the bar tried to print me a bill but the machine ran out of paper so she disappeared to go find some. I explain to another barman that I have no cash but am happy to pay on card without a receipt and he says it’s policy they have to give one. 5 mins pass and this 3rd person still hasn’t got back with my bill nor the paper.

I move to the exit and ask the person on concierge to find her, or a manager. They go off looking and return saying she’s ended her shift, but to ask the manager at the bar. This is another 5mins now so we’re around the 20min mark.


I find the manager working behind the bar who is talking to another member of staff, and he tells me to wait by the cash register near the exit and someone will see me shortly. I tell him no, they need to take my payment now or I have to leave, explaining about my poorly child and wife waiting. No problem Sir I’ll get someone right on it.


My wife is absolutely blowing up my phone now and I wait for another 2 mins then tell my daughter (aged 8) it’s time to go, I’ll pay them later. We leave and get in the car explaining to my wife what just happened: she tells me I’m TA for not paying and setting a bad example to my daughter, but I’m so mad now that I just want to get the kids to bed, and drive home.


I do intend on calling the restaurant tomorrow to pay, but as things stand am I TA?


Edit & update: 
just called the restaurant general manager and told them what happened, she was very worried that my daughter had eaten something and gotten ill from this. I assured them this was almost certainly not the case but they took the details of everything she ate and drank just in case. 

She then said that waiting that long was ridiculous and they wondered what had happened to that bill as nobody (!!!?!???????) could remember. That got me pretty mad but thankfully she felt the same haha. She said as way of an apology the meal was on them, no charge, and hoped it wouldn’t deter us from visiting again. She also said that not many people would have called back the next day and thanked me for being honest. I thanked her and closed the book on that.


With regards to my wife as someone mentioned below I am going to give her a pass for that. She had spent something like 25mins in the car with a kid throwing up out of the window in the rain, and I didn’t communicate properly so she didn’t know what was going on.

474,Asshole,"My girlfriend has social anxiety. When her parents moved she moved in with me and my family (my parents, and 3 siblings and I) and she told me she needs to have a place in the house where she can “escape” of she needs to. Of course that has to be our room since well it is ours and the whole house is pretty much occupied with everyone else. She wants me to let her know if I’m inviting more than one person into her “safe space”. She says she gets “overwhelmed” if I suddenly force social interaction on her without warning. Here’s the problem I can’t always do that. Sometimes I’m talking with my siblings and they want to play a movie or game or just hang out in my room, and they are excited. I can’t just be like “hold on let me tell my gf” that’s just stupid. So a lot of the time I just end up letting them in whenever. Sometimes I forget to close the door and my siblings tend to just walk in and out if the door isn’t all the way closed, so I can’t control that either. My gf is getting increasingly mad at me that I keep doing this. I think she is overreacting. She can’t expect everyone on earth to obey her social standards. She says I’m overreacting, and that it’s extremely hard for her to socialize all day at work and she just wants a space where she doesn’t have too. She says she just wants a heads up.

19662,Asshole,"Recently me(26f), my best friend(26f) and my boyfriend(28m) decided to live together and rent a house. My boyfriend and I found the house, we all had to fill out an extensive application with work history and 5 references each. The agency approved us with my boyfriend being the actual main tenant on the lease because he makes the most money, I was signed as a secondary on the lease. My friend was “approved to live at the residence” but was not technically signed on the lease. 

My boyfriend was very upfront about having the concerns of having any strangers stay overnight in the house. This was communicated to my friend. Not saying we would never allow someone to stay overnight; just need to meet them first, get to know them a bit, and in general just communication and warning. The house responsibility will ultimately fall on him if something say is damaged or anything because he is the main tenant.

So the day before my friend is to move in she says her friend(with benefits) is in town that weekend and would like to visit. I initially told her I would rather him not visit so soon because the house is still a mess from moving and I would like to just relax and get comfortable as a house first. She explained he was going to be gone for 6 weeks so this was her only chance to see him. I agreed that he could visit, and as far as I was concerned this did not mean he was staying the night. We had told her about not wanting people that we(as in the whole house) did not know staying the night. I realize after awhile she has no intention of her friend leaving. My boyfriend is very upset. As this is the ONLY concern he had about my friend moving in is having a man he did not know staying the night. 

I tried to peacefully confront her, bringing up how uncomfortable we were with it and that this is the exact thing we did not want. KEEP IN MIND this will have been the second night she has spent in the house. We requested that her friend leave by 8am at least. She was upset saying that she should be able to have whoever she wants stay over since she pays 1/3 of the rent. This ends up turning into a fight and then she packs a bag and leaves with her friend telling me she will be back in a few days. 

AITA for not allowing sleepovers? I want her to feel comfortable and that the house is also hers to live in but I think having house guests even in the house let alone stay over should always be a group consensus or at least advanced warning. But this has happened on the second night, we have not been able to even figure out how we mesh as roommates. It’s not like we are saying she can NEVER have someone over, just communication.

15136,Not the A-hole,"Before you start pointing fingers because of the title, I need to clarify some things first.

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for almost two years now. From the start of our relationship, we agreed that either of us can have sex with someone else as long as we’re informed about it beforehand. We both agree that there is a distinct difference between a romantic relationship and a sexual one, and so long as we together are the only ones in a romantic relationship, we don’t care what the opposite person does with their body.

Fast forward to a couple days ago where my boyfriend tells me “I think I cheated on you”, and when I asked why he thought that, he said “You know Jake? Yeah, so he and I had sex last week” (not his real name, obviously).

I honestly thought how he worded that was really funny, and I told him I wasn’t mad as long as he told me beforehand next time. He agreed, and we’re completely fine.

Today, I went to my coworker ‘Nikki’ to tell her about the funny encounter (we tell each other a lot of things like this, so it’s not exactly weird). She was confused until I reminded her that we’re in an open relationship, and then agreed that it was pretty amusing.

My assistant manager, who we’ll call ‘Anna’, was not so amused after overhearing this conversation. She told me to break up with my boyfriend, and when I said that it was okay and explained the open relationship, she told me that he was an asshole for cheating and that I was an asshole for thinking that it was funny.

Obviously, I know I’m not an asshole for finding the encounter humorous, but I’m starting to feel like an asshole for bringing it up in the first place. I feel so bad for making anyone think that my boyfriend was a bad person.


Tl;dr Am I the asshole for painting my boyfriend out as a cheater to my coworker, and should I have kept it to myself?

Edit 1: This in no way justifies my case, and I know talking about sex isn’t the most appropriate thing to do at work, but I work away from any sort of customer or client, and you have to be over 18 in my department. Because of this, conversations between coworkers get a little risqué, and even my previous and current managers will talk about inappropriate topics. Even Anna (and especially Nikki) don’t bite their tongues when talking about sex. I know it doesn’t make what I said morally acceptable, but I wanted to share some light as to the environment I work in.",30,26,0.74,AITA for telling my coworker that my boyfriend cheated on me?,b8jtgj,2019-04-02 14:19:02,NTA,2423,AITA

20425,Not the A-hole,"so i'm telling this on behalf of my elder sister as she's been upset with herself over this and kept questioning... i figured that here's the right place for this.

my sister (32, f) has been married to her husband (36, m) for almost 5 years now and they're both blessed with a son (2, m). my sister rarely gets her own ""me time"" and usually just gives in whenever her husband leaves as he's also in a band so he would disappear to practice a lot. 

let's just say my sister is the one looking after the toddler most of the time even while working full time while her husband's busy with his own hobbies (band, working out) during his free time. 

so today, she got some ""me time"", in which she had informed more than a week prior and woke up early to keep the house in check, cook for everyone including the son. she was only gone for 5 hours as she went to buy new necessities for herself and even got her son a new toy from the store, excited to return because she doesn't leave him often.

once she's back, the tiny kid was sound asleep and suddenly she felt the need to ask the dad about how things went. it ended up with her asking him ""did finish all of the fried rice? because i made a lot,"" and to her surprise... he said he did not feed him the rice simply because she didn't remind him to. additionally, the toddler didn't ask for it too (mind you, the kid can't even talk yet).

my sister instantly felt sick from hearing his answers and she stormed off, upset, but can't stop blaming herself either for not reminding him. however, isn't it common sense? you're the dad of a child and you think keeping him in one piece alive is all you have to do without thinking of his other necessities. or is she truly the one at fault for not giving him a simple reminder?

he basically only looked after the kid, made sure he didn't get into any injuries, didn't even change his diapers or feed him.

who's the asshole here?

13962,Not the A-hole,"Background: (sorry it’s long and a lot of dumb drama)

My MIL and my husband and I have a very strained relationship. She is very manipulative, and when she doesn’t get what she wants, she can be very cruel, and usually spins the narrative to make herself seem like a victim and my husband the aggressor.  On the flip side, when things are going her way, she’s very kind and generous. 

We have four kids. A three year old and then baby 2 became surprise triplets who just recently turned a year old. 

Her favorite guilt trip is over us not making the drive over six hours a way with a toddler and three infants instead of her coming to us for holidays and special occasions. We get this every holiday until she realizes my husband won’t give in, and never apologizes for the cruel things she says during the fights. 

I’m sick of it and her. My husband has considered many times going NC but never does

So fast forward:

I recently discovered my MIL has been posting a lot of pictures of the triplets on her Facebook. She tags the lot of them with a million different triplet tags. 

These aren’t always pictures she’s taken herself. Most of the time they are pictures my husband has sent to her because she asks him for recent pictures. She captions them as if she took them, and as if she was there. She makes up a narrative like “they were crying until she came in and scooped all three up and then they started giggling” etc. 

This made me furious. I think I saw red. My husband and I only post pictures once every three months or so, and when we do we make sure our privacy settings are locked down so only our close friends can see. Her pictures are NOT locked down. I’m not friends with her and I could see all the posts. 

Anyone with multiples knows there’s a lot of weird people on the internet when it comes to twins and triplets. Some people fetishize multiples, and steal pictures to post as their own. It’s creepy. 

I reported every photo on Facebook. FB allows you to report pictures of your minor children that you don’t want, and will remove them.

What I didn’t know is that it tells the poster that the photos are being removed. 

So MIL sends a message to my husband talking about how heartbroken she is that “someone” reported these pictures. She also separately talked to the rest of the family. 

The whole family thinks whoever did it is a huge asshole. 

I didn’t admit to it. I thought I was justified at the time, but now I’m second guessing myself because of how they’re talking about “whoever did it” and because honestly my motives weren’t completely pure. Part of it was anger at my MIL using the photos for likes, and part of it was concern at the weirdos with her unsecured privacy settings, and part of it was general irritation at her because of the poor relationship between her, myself, and my husband.

During my prior pregnancies, I would always let my husband touch/kiss my belly and talk to my belly as much as he wanted, but something about it this time makes my skin crawl.

I  also am struggling with him touching my belly, I think, because I am starting to feel like a brood mare, so when he focuses more on my belly than on me then it reinforces that thought. For example, he'll want to kiss my belly before he kisses me, and that makes me feel less like a person and more like an object.

I should also add that I wonder if partly this is subconscious resentment. I originally wanted three kids, but my husband persuaded me to have one more which turned out to be twins. And this pregnancy has been so much harder than any of my others.

But I know teenagers can be sneaky, so I have a backup tracking plan that I keep secret from her. I have an extra older version iphone on my family plan that I use as an emergency phone.

His mom was due to arrive only 15 minutes after that so I explained and she was really mad, saying I was negligent in caring for her son, I could have killed him, he’s going to be so sick now, am I happy, etc. 

My wife and sister feel * awful*, they’re beside themselves that anything bad happened to a kid under their watch. I’ve kept this to myself but I don’t really feel all that bad..? 

I mean, obviously if I could go back and prevent this from happening I would, but I think expecting a host parent to spot your kid throughout a whole party is kind of an overreach. 

Should I be feeling remorse or can I in good conscience tell my wife and sis not to stress over this?

10062,Asshole,"My daughter Molly (13) plays football (that's English football/soccer btw) for a team and they train every sunday. She has been playing for years but has only been with this team for a few months. Molly loves football and is very talented and her coach Chelsey is very pleased with her. 

However, on the team there are a group of five girls who don't like Molly. They all go to the same school and their parents all know each other, and as often happens with teenage girls it gets quite clique-y and territorial. This group see themselves as the ''real'' team and pretty much only work with each other during matches and don't support anyone who isn't in their group. Molly has been told by this group that she isn't welcome. The worst of them is a girl called Amy. A talented player but really dislikes Molly for some reason. She has made Molly cry before and has only gotten worse after being told by Chelsey to tone the mean girl stuff down. 

Today was a big match, and Molly scored what turned out to be the winning goal. What should have been a happy day turned bad when Molly came out of the locker room in tears saying that Amy and her friends had hidden her stuff, and that Amy had told her she was useless and only on the team because Chelsey felt sorry for her. Chelsey found the stuff, and had a word with Amy and her mum, saying that anymore bullying would result in her being kicked off the team. 

This made Amy cry and Amy's mum then had a go at me, saying Molly needs to grow up and accept what she calls typical girls ''teasing'' each other. I know the difference between teasing and bullying and as an adult she should too. 

The thing is that if Amy gets kicked out, her gang of bullies will still be there, and I can't imagine it would be much fun for Molly if it was there. Chelsey has said that she'd be willing to kick out Molly's group as well if they cause trouble, as there are enough girls trying to get a place on the team to replace them. But I feel like that would cause problems down the line especially with the other parents. 

Molly spent most of the day crying and due to that I am thinking of pulling her out of the team. She loves football and is good at it but if she's leaving something that she's supposed to be having fun in tears then we have a problem. We can find her another team since there are loads out there. 

The only problem is that I feel like if I pull her out she may come out feeling like she was the problem and that's she's being punished even though she's the victim, especially since Chelsey is willing to deal with the bullies once and for all so it feels like we are letting them and their parents win.

The gist of the story is that my sister went into labor and her husband was out with friends. He didn’t realize he didn’t have service and missed all her calls and ended up missing the birth, which all in all took about 6 hours.

I visited the next day and my sister was clearly really upset with her husband and he was apologizing over and over but she was telling him to just leave it alone and drop it, but in a really snappy way. It really cast a bad light on a day that was supposed to be happy. So I told my sister to just drop it. She became very upset and told me to shut my mouth and not comment on what I don’t understand.

19291,Not the A-hole,"I recently turned 23 (three days ago!) and I travelled to stay with my parents. Lockdown is started to be lifted, and you can visit a small number of people, I live alone and have been isolating the whole time so I decided to spent a week with my family.

On my birthday we get to the present giving and I received 1 gift from my entire family - a book. A book I had asked for which isn’t even really a fun gift because I need it for research since my library is closed (work part time, grad school part time, fully support myself)

My family are usually generous gift givers, Christmas and birthdays are always a mix between gifts you ask for and gifts bought spontaneously. I was disappointed to receive nothing from my brother and no surprises from my parents. I’m happy with a book, but it did hurt my feelings not to get anything else. Money isn’t a problem for my parents, my dad just got an expensive watch for himself and my mum was telling me about a fairly pricey collectible item she preordered. On the day they didn’t really offer an explanation, and I was too embarrassed and awkward to really comment. 

Anyway. I’m staying with my parents for the rest of the week and decided to spent some money on a couple things for myself to celebrate my own birthday - I’ve ordered a couple items to the house, bought a new game for my laptop and was playing it. Mum has noticed I had something delivered earlier, plus I was playing a new game, and asked me about it. I said something to the effect of “Well I’ve had to buy myself presents this year.”

She turned a bit red and got very annoyed at me, and later on my dad scolded me for making my mother feel guilty. It’s not my fault she feels guilty - it’s the truth! At first I thought I was justified but now I can’t tell if my hurt is justified or if I am just being a brat.

EDIT TO ADDRESS COMMON QUESTIONS:

The cost of the book was around £20.

My parents don’t support me financially.

I don’t have access to their bank statements so I don’t know exactly what their situation is but from their regular spending habits and recent purchases they seem to be doing fine. (My parents have said they’ve actually saved money in the lockdown because neither of them are commuting anymore my mother has bought a bracelet the collectible item my father a new watch ect)

I don’t remember the exact wording of what I said, what I posted was an estimation. So it’s interesting that a lot of the judgements are hinging on just one word. I know I didn’t insult my mother or put any particular stress on the sentence it was much more a casual explanation when she asked me why I had a package delivered and who it was from.

People saying I upset my mother or made her cry.... I didn’t. She didn’t cry and hasn’t seemed upset her tone was more annoyed/embarrassed. I definitely don’t insult my mother or bring her to tears. 

I also regularly buy gifts for my parents and always give gifts for their birthdays/Christmas/anniversary. I make sure to remember because my brother rarely does.",356,1821,0.95,AITA for buying my own presents for my birthday after my family didn’t?,hajvvb,2020-06-17 04:18:12,NTA,3036,AITA

My wife has always preferred it when I wear them (or so she says).

Recently one side neighbour got their kids a trampoline and put it right next to the fence. The other side neighbours kids like to climb on top of stuff they have next to the fence so they can see over. 

I like to spend time outside in our entertaining area out in the backyard reading/relaxing plus I have to go out there to hang out laundry/garden/take the garbage out from time to time. 

It’s school holidays here atm, so all the neighbour kids have been spending the majority of the time outside. Unfortunately every time I go out into my backyard there is usually at least one of the kids who hears or sees me and starts yelling at me constantly from over the fence . 

Now if it’s the first time I’ve seen them that day I’ll say Hi and go about my business.  But the kids usually have a bunch of follow up questions like ‘what are you doing?’, I’ll tell them and then it’s ‘And then what are you doing?’ Etc etc until I go back inside.

11237,Not the A-hole,"Background: I'm a working actor and I need a new headshot photo. The photographer that I worked with before charges $300 for a 1-hour session (which compared to other photogs in my city... is not bad. Most others charge $500)

I asked my dad to help split it with me. He called back a couple days later and said that he had reached out to two people willing to do it for free.

1) A family friend we used to live next door to. From what I remember, she mostly did concert photography. But her daughter is an actor, a model and was in pageants, so I trust that she knows what to look for in terms of headshots (she might have actually taken her daughter's headshots??? I'll have to ask..)

2) my grandma's new husband's daughter. I've literally only seen her at Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner. Yeah. That's all i have to describe her lol.

My first instinct was to just immediately go for the family friend, but I figured reaching out to the husband's daughter would be a nice way to welcome her to the family and get to know her.

After getting her phone number from my Grandma, I asked to see her portfolio and if she has experience with headshots.

She got immediately offended and accused me of not trusting her, being all like ""I know what I'm doing"", ""i've been doing photography for years"", ""i'm doing you a favor"", blah blah.

Then she told her dad and my Grandma and now my Grandma is blowing up my phone saying that I hurt her feelings and that 'family should come first', all this stuff.

My dad tried to defend me by saying that i'm looking at other options and that it makes sense for me to want to see a portfolio (bless his heart). This made Grandma even more upset and now she's accusing my dad and I of not being accepting of her husband's family.

And bc she's a Facebook Grandma, now the whole fam is in our business and taking sides on the issue.

(And after all this, I still have yet to see a goddamn portfolio???? I found her instagram... Nice selfies but nothing that says anything about her professional quality.)

AITA here?? I thought I was being reasonable but now I'm questioning myself. I didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings, I just thought I was being professional

EDIT: Because people are getting confused... I did not reach out to her myself. Nor did I ask my dad to reach out to her. He did that entirely of his own volition. 

I already had a photographer that I wanted. I just asked for him to split the cost, not for him to go searching for another photographer. He decided by himself to talk to her.

I only considered her, bc I wanted to be nice and give her a chance. Also, he didn't ask her to do it for free. She offered. She set that price. No one told her to do it for free. 

And for those asking ""what's the harm?"":
The photos may be free, but I still have to pay for hair, makeup and transportation. Not to mention, finding the time between two jobs and an intensive rehearsal schedule. One doesn't just walk into a studio photo-ready and take photos in 30 seconds. It takes time, effort, and preparation from all participants involved.

Why waste the time and money on a photo session with her if she's not a good fit? Especially when I can use that time on an actual professional?

So today I was running some errands, and one of my stops was the bank in a local strip mall. As I approached the bank, there was an older lady (60s?) with a dog that was wearing a green vest labelled ""Service Dog in Training"".  An older gentlemen (also 60s?) was yelling at her. My curiosity was piqued. I stood a respectable distance back, but close enough to see and hear what was going on. And I watched.

The man was up in her face yelling about how both she and her dog are divas, and this is an open space and his dog can do what he wants if he's not hurting anyone. The lady was yelling back that it's a service dog in training and she asked him to keep his distance.

(I got here after the incident that caused the yelling happened, but I suspect that the man's dog approached the woman's service dog in training and she asked him to give her space, causing this blow up).

Anyways after a few minutes of yelling they both noticed me standing there. I was clearly engrossed in their altercation and my pose and distance made that obvious. I got asked what I was doing and said, ""Um, listening to you guys yell.""

This prompted them both to call me an asshole (and to give me the inspiration to post here!). It also resulted in the end of the scene, with the man leaving and myself continuing to the bank.

But she kept saying, “go see a doctor”, to the point where I got really irritated and upset and said that maybe she should also go see a doctor about her weight gain.

21797,Not the A-hole,"I do not consent to my story being posted anywhere else. 

Me and the said friend (Jane) had been best friends for around 12 years. I met her when she started dating one of my best friends. 

We both got married around 10 years back, few months apart. Around 6 years ago, she confided to me that they were trying to have a baby. But they were having a lot of issues. I tried to be as supportive as I could be. 

Around 4 years ago, I fell pregnant. It was a surprise, but a pleasant one. When I announced it, I could see that I hurt Jane. I apologised to her because I knew how much this infertility was affecting her. 

Few months ago, we announced our second pregnancy. Here is where shit hit the fan. Immediately after we announced it, she refused to talk to me or see me anymore. 

I thought she was upset because of my pregnancy and I was giving her space but John (her husband) told me to go talk to her as she needs me. She told me that she had a miscarriage just one week before I announced my pregnancy and she couldn't bear it. I apologised so many times and I was trying to support her emotionally. She cried to me, I consoled her but next day she told me to leave her alone. I respected that. 

A week ago, my son's birthday came up and we thought we will have a social distancing BBQ for him with few people (6). I sent an invite to John and Jane but I told them that they don't have to attend if they don't want to. (Edit: because John is the godfather. It would have been weird to not invite them at all)

Jane and John attended. Few hours later, I saw that Jane was very withdrawn and upset. So I went to her and asked her if she was okay. She THREW her plate across the yard and started yelling at me. About how much of a bad friend I am and how selfish I am. She told me that I am trying to rub her face with my happy family and healthy pregnancy. She yelled at me about how insensitive it was of me to announce my preganancy right after her miscarriage (In my defence I did not know and I apologised) . She even yelled at me about how I probably just invited her so I could parade my baby bump and lovely son (did she expect me to not have a bump when I am 7 months pregnant).

There are lot of things I could forgive. But she not only made a scene in front of some really close friends, she yelled at me in front of my son in MY house. When I kept being silent, she asked me whether I was even going to apologise for doing this to her. I just told her I am done apologising for things that aren't my fault and asked her to leave my house. John took her away even though she looked like she wanted to yell more. 

Next day I told John that I don't want to speak with Jane anymore. I told him he is still my best friend but I would understand if he has to choose sides and can't talk with me anymore. 

I don't know what happened between them after that, but John came to my house yesterday and said he wants to leave Jane and he wanted to crash at my place for a few weeks. He said he is not ready to talk about what happened yet. So I am not pushing.

So at the end of February of this year I was homeless and living in my truck with my dog. We lived in a parking lot of a Walmart for 60 days. Just panhandling and doing our best. I was causally dating a guy and we had broken up off and on. 

I found out I was pregnant. Now we have become so close. We moved in together. I am working again and we've adopted 7 cats since. It's a dream. I still have not seen a doctor.  I am starting to show and its getting obvious. 

So here is the problem. Having been homeless and lived that life I know I'm not the healthiest. I have my first Dr appointment in August. I should be 4 or 5 months along. I don't want anyone to come with me. Including him. I am scared I am going to get bad news. Like that I've lost it and my body is still pretending to be pregnant or that there is a problem.

So I usually share with either friends, colleagues, neighbors or other people  that come over. 

I started a new job a couple of months ago and this was the first time I brought something here (it was a type of cookie). I explained to the people there in the moment why I brought it and put in in the break area for everyone to grab when/if they wanted.

I said it was me and started to explain why when she interrupted me and asked if I took her allergy (gluten allergy) into account. I said sorry no and explained why I brought this. She said I was extremely rude for not thinking of everyone. And that it was better to not bring anything if not everyone could enjoy it. She said I was very selfish and don’t think about others. I gave a half-assed apology and told myself not to bring anything again.

18418,Not the A-hole,"So the wife bought me a dog for my birthday. It hasn’t arrived yet, the seller is driving her down next week when she is old enough to be separated. It’s not that I don’t love dogs, I do, we have a 12 year old dog she and I got together, and she’s my first baby. But we also have two children under the age of 5. One is still potty training and the other is a normal 5 year old with boundless energy, imagination and a million questions.

We both work full time (pre everything going on right now) but her job has stupid hours. She’s out of the house before 7 am and usually not home until 8/9 pm, so the bulk of the day to day family routine falls on me. So every day I get the kids up, dressed, fed and out the door by 730 on our way to school/daycare/work. Do my normal gig, then head off to get them back home. On the best of days I get home around 615/630 and start the pm routine to cook, feed, bathe, get them in bed and set ourselves up for the next morning all in the course of 2 hours. It’s hectic but somehow it works...most days.

So a a few months ago when the subject of getting a puppy came up (there was an opportunity to get a puppy from friends) I was adamantly against the idea. My position was there just wasn’t time in the day and with our lives I know that responsibility would fall squarely on me. At the moment I can not add one more thing to our already tight routine.

I also don’t think it’s fair to a puppy to be alone that long every day. Our dog is older and is content with the peace and quiet because when we’re all home it’s anything but! I agreed that when the kiddos were older and could realistically take on that responsibility or our job situation changed, I would be 100% on board, but as it is now I don’t want new dog. So we didn’t get the puppy at the time and I thought she agreed with me it was a bad idea

Until last night. My birthday is around the corner and the wife wanted to give me my gift early. She was excited about it and is the worst at keeping secrets. When I unwrapped the collar withstand picture of the puppy my enthusiasm did not match hers so now she’s upset.

Ok so I got a house and it came with a hot tub. Awesome. Last owners didn't winterize it before moving out, less awesome. It leaks.

Call a repair company. Repair guy comes out a couple times, checks the things, fixes one thing, still leaks, comes back finds a cracked pipe. Still I'm 100% fine with this. Normal repair stuff.

The repair company then says, to fix the pipe we need to get underneath it and you'll have to get a bunch of guys to come over and stand it up on its side (these things are very heavy). Also, the room it's in might not be big enough to stand it up on its side so you might have to cut and replace a board to do this. Call us when it's done and we will come back and work on the tub again.

If I went to a car repair shop to get my brakes fixed, it would be unheard of for them to tell me that they can fix my car but only if I can get it up in the air first.

I am operating under the assumption that hot tub repair people as a group have run into the problem of ""hot tubs are heavy"" and a good company would have the tools, manpower, and equipment to handle this foreseeable repair obstacle. I've never in my life had a repair company try to get me so involved in the actual repair work of my job. I give them the money, they fix my hot tub.

I moved to a friends place for free at 15ish because I couldn't afford to both pay rent/bills and finish high school. When I was almost 18 my parents had my younger sister. At that point I had already moved interstate for uni and was fully supporting myself.

She's now 14, one of my parents has passed away and the other is currently unable to look after her for health reasons. The family is wanting me to take my sister in but I'm not interested. I've told them they can take her in. I'm getting told how heartless I am. Thing is, I don't want to look after a teenager.  I've only interacted with my sister a handful of times. I share parents with her but that's pretty arbitrary and isn't' really a compelling argument.

10746,Not the A-hole,"I went on a couples vacation with four other couples weeks ago. We were invited by one couple we knew but didn't know the three other couples. We are all Black, in the South, mid-20s. 

We all shared an Airbnb house and spent a few evenings of the week hanging out in the den, drinking and talking. For the most part, it was a good time and we all got to know each other well enough to have fun conversations and get to know one another well.

One evening the conversation goes into a discussion about race. One of the girls I knew previously was talking about how someone she knew was ""White mixed with Spanish"" and I respectfully explained that wasn't a thing, as you can be White and Spanish, and race and nationality are separate things. Ends up she meant Hispanic when she was saying Spanish, and the discussion evolved into me explaining the difference between race, ethnicity, and nationality - I genuinely just want my people to go out into the world knowing the difference. 

One couple was rolling their eyes at my explanations and said it wasn't that serious and that they're gonna stick to how they already say things. I just smiled and fell back. The conversation keeps going and the guy of the couple rolling their eyes - Chuck - is talking about how ""strong"" Black genes are and how if someone is mixed with Black they typically look mostly or fully Black because our DNA is ""dominant."" People are nodding their heads in agreement. I jumped in to say that wasn't how DNA works. Chuck replies with a sarcastic and dismissive comment like ""Yeah, yeah I bet"" and everyone laughs. I fell back for the rest of the evening. 

The next evening there was a conversation about educational systems by state since a few people there were originally from Mississippi and we all now lived in Texas. Before I chimed in with just general commentary, Chuck joked ""Go ahead, we know how much you like your statistics!"" It felt super malicious to me and I fell back in the conversation and went to bed early. 

Later on I asked my boyfriend if he would tell me if I was ever embarrassing myself or doing too much around other people. He assured me he would. I brought up the situation before and said I felt perhaps I was unintentionally being an asshole and failed to read the room. He said maybe I was being a bit of an asshole know it all, but it was fine and at least I didn't say anything actually wrong. I said there was a lot of ignorance I didn't bother commenting on during this vacation and it was unfair that the one conversation I spoke up, I was a know it all. We left the conversation at that.

10429,Asshole,"My wife and I manage our finances jointly. (combine all income and budget together) Thanks to /r/personalfinance, I firmly believe that every dollar I earn/spend has to have a purpose, no matter how small the amount. I also believe that if we were to help either of our parents, it should be not only mutually agreed, but also budgeted for. The emphasis here is that I believe helping either of the parents shouldn't be from just their biological child, but rather from both of us, since we're a couple that manages money jointly.

To allow some flexibility on personal expenses, we give ourselves a fixed “allowance”. Beer night out, football tickets, etc. come out from here. She doesn’t have as many hobbies as I, but she uses it for girl’s night out or non-essential expensive shopping. For the most part she is not a big spender in the first place so often has money leftover.

I noticed that she uses her allowance for her parents. While traveling to Europe, we wanted to bring back some souvenirs for the family. We agreed to cap the gift budget at $50 on each of our parents. After buying gifts that total up to $50, she wanted to buy more stuff for her dad, and said ""I'll just pay for it with my own allowance."" It's her money, so I couldn't say anything, but it didn't feel that great, for reasons I still can't exactly articulate. I just remember thinking “why the hell did we agree to cap it at $50 then?”

Not too long ago, I learned that she's paying for her parents' cell phone bill with her allowance. She's been on their family plan, and her portion of the bill is obviously budgeted for. I learned that she's been paying the rest of the bill out of her pocket. Another time, her dad was complaining about how icloud storage is not enough. She signed him up for the upgraded storage, and I saw her entering her personal card instead of asking for his. I mean, it's like $1/month so not a big deal, but I guess it irritated me a little just based on principle.

It's not like I don't want to spend money on her parents. In fact, when we eat out with her parents, we pay 95%+ of the time. He's yet to pay for the full check once in my 4-year marriage. Neither my nor her parents are that well off, so we try to open our wallet as much as we can. It often causes our food budget to go over, but we sacrifice elsewhere to make up for it. But paying for meals comes out from our joint budget and WE are treating them.

To summarize why I don’t like her allowance being spent on her parents:

* Instead of “hey, we decided to pay for your cell phone bill to help you out”, she’s been paying on her own without telling me.
* This isn’t what allowances were intended to be. It’s so that within a limit, we can freely enjoy/buy things we want.

Her thought is that it's her money to spend freely, and I should keep my nose out of her business. I'm totally open to changing my view if I'm being too controlling. Am I being the ass hole here? Thanks for any input!!

I’m pregnant with twins at the moment, something I’m struggling with a lot as I don’t want to and will not keep them. Due to loads of personal reasons I decided not to be involved in their lives. (Even strongly considered abortion before. ) 

My plan was to give them up for adoption, but their father (who I have no relationship with) decided he wants to keep them and there’s not much I can do about that. However, I made it clear to him that I will move away once they’re born and want to know nothing about them, sign away my rights, etc. 

In my last appointment he wanted to come, and I agreed, though I said I didn’t want to find out their gender. He asked if HE alone could find out and he wouldn’t tell me. (He can come across quite strong and I struggle with being assertive like that, so I agreed.) 

Little bit later and he already let me slip what they are, which has made me incredibly upset. He says he didn’t do it on purpose but I don’t believe him. (He wants me be to be their mom.) 

I told him I don’t want him joining any of my appointments ever again and would prefer to see him as less as possible until they’re born. He thinks I’m completely overreacting and as he will be their only parent, he should be there ‘so at least one person who cares about them is there’. He wants to be as involved as possible now. 

AITA for telling him he can’t ever come to my appointments anymore (taking away this experience from him) and I don’t want to speak to him anymore (not more than necessary)?

I got out around midnight and texted him I was done  and heading home but he was asleep. 

Now. I knew when I got home he probably would have liked for me to wake him up.  But I had to wake up at 430am for work again, it was already 1ish. I needed a shower and a minute for myself so I ate the frys I got and took a shower, then turned all the lights off and grabbed my stuff to walk into the bedroom, he had just then woken up thinking I just got home. Hes mad now, I tell him I took a shower and ate and was coming to bed. Very sweetly, trying to understand maybe he was just groggy and worried. But it just turned into me being inconsiderate. I dont check in enough. I dont think about how he feels. I should have woken him up.  I was mad but eventually just hugged him and he said that's all he needed. I dont feel like I did anything wrong. But he thinks I did. I never go out. I work and come home to him. I text him in the morning before my shift starts most mornings and if I'm gonna be late I let him know.

9791,Not the A-hole,"So this happened at about 830ish while I was at work on my break. I checked my phone and see a message from my roommate asking if I can give her roommate a ride home and that she already told him I would since I'm giving her a ride (wtf???).

Background time: my roommate doesn't drive and sometimes I give her a ride home when she has a late shift and buses aren't running.

Back to the story: I have never once met this coworker and this is the first time I've heard of his existence. I told her that I didn't really appreciate that she offered without asking me first. Then I asked where he lives. Opposite side of town from us; technically a different town altogether. All in all it'd be another 30 minutes of driving. Fuck that. I could ask for gas money but that's not really the issue. Don't know him, not comfortable with that, also lives very far away.

I was just about done working a double shift and I was not liking the idea of having to chauffeur for someone who aparantly can't plan ahead. And yes, I checked this fact. This coworker did nothing to plan for the fact that they did not have a ride/bus; they get the schedule a week at a time.

My roommate begins guilt tripping me. Saying if I don't give him a ride he has to walk for an hour in the rain. Honestly, that gets a whopping boo-fucking-hoo from me. And it wasn't even raining. It just might have rained.

So she's pissed at me. I ask if he's asked other co-workers. Aparantly not. I'm the first person he goes to?? Someone he doesn't know know , let alone even work with? What. What. That's not how... No. Just. No. So she gets him to ask around and evidently a coworker there lives near him and can give him a ride. But nevertheless...I wouldn't have given him a ride. Totally not comfortable with that.

11119,Asshole,"Ok full story with context.
I am good friends with a couple for around 10 years, the guy is arguably one of my best friends since teenage years (I'm now 29) and the girl I also become good friends with through their relationship.
 
They're getting married and of course, I am invited. The invites come out 1 year before the wedding because it is an overseas wedding and they want to give people plenty of notice. I am single at the time of the invite and I RSVP immediately for myself.

9 months out from the wedding, I meet a girl and get with her. It's a relationship with a real spark, the likes of which I've never experienced and my feelings towards this woman are very strong. We are together for about 2 months before I realise I'd like for her to come along with me to the wedding as a +1. When I plan to ask, I'm not expecting a yes or no, I'm not really expecting anything, I'm only mentioning it super early as a ""feeler"" to see if it was A) Possible and B) Ok with them.
So I mention it during a phone call with my mate and there is zero pressure in my request, the phone call was fairly quick and I simply asked if it was possible to squeeze her in as my +1. It should be said, that the couple knows my partner. She worked with my good mate for quite some time and they both think highly of her and were (at least to my face) supportive of our relationship. His response was *""I'll have a chat with the lady and let you know.""*

2 weeks later I get a text from him saying *""About the wedding, it's absolutely fine if she comes but the final numbers are not due until a few months before the wedding. I'm not trying to imply anything by this, but you two haven't been together long and you never know how the next few months will pan out. I don't mean to upset you by saying that but I'm sure you know where I'm coming from.""*

I was bothered by this and I made it clear, by saying *""I understand that you felt that way, but to me the comment about the length/instability of the relationship just felt unnecessary.""* His response to this was then *""Sorry I hit a sore point, There are heaps of people who we couldn't bring to our wedding so you asking me for a +1 with a new relationship was a bit of a surprise. I would have made that comment about any relationship that had been going that long to any of my mates. Every extra person we have adds to what we have to pay for the wedding.""*

There was no mention of financial burden of bringing extra people in his original response. Had that actually been the case, that’s totally fine. 

They feel like I was out of line asking and shouldn’t have. I feel like there was no harm in putting out a feeler and give them plenty of notice. I was completely fine with a yes or no and felt the comment about it being my relationship being an uncertainty (aren't all relationships?) was not needed. Am I the asshole here? Any insight on this is greatly appreciated because it has hurt my relationship with the couple.

At first I was strictly against this relationship not only because of the obvious age gap but also because my daughter is still too young to be dating and because I want to pick the guy for her (not to be misunderstood with force relationship, I just want to be the one to introduce her to a guy I trust). After all the nagging coming from her and her mother I ended up agreeing to this relationship in the end but I still don’t really like the guy.

Recently, her boyfriend had a massive dispute with his landlord and he had to give up the house. Since renting is challenging where we live, my daughter asked us if her boyfriend could move here until he finds a place to sleep to which we agreed.

Despite my nicest attempts to be understanding with them, they have already taken it too far. At night while we were preparing to sleep, I caught my daughter in the same room with her boyfriend getting ready for bed. I told her that if she wants her boyfriend to stay, she will need to switch rooms with her brother. This pissed her off and she told me that I should understand that since they are together it is normal for them to also ""sleep"" together. I replied by telling her that this is the ONLY thing I am asking them to do and if they can’t even do this then he should get out. She ended up agreeing and we woke up my son and they switched rooms.

Today my wife was very mad at me for this and she and her daughter haven’t been talking to me.

I take care of this dog about 90%. I get him the food, take him to the vet when he needs to, I keep up with his vaccines, I walk him every day, etc. My boyfriend doesn’t do any of these things, only helps with money when he has to.

Last weekend my grandma passed unexpectedly and I had to be at my mom’s a lot during the week to help her out with stuff. Our dog is on treatment for an ear infection and we have to give him medicine once a day and put drops in his ears twice a day. I tried to remind my boyfriend each thing at the correct hour because I know he can be forgetful. 

Last night I came home very tired and stressed. It was a hard day, we received my grandma’s ashes and I was all day helping my mom out with errands. When I get here my boyfriend is playing videogames. I ask him if he gave our dog the medicine, he says he forgot. It was the only day I didn’t remind him, since I was running around all day and forgot myself. When he tells me this, I get pissed. I said I couldn’t believe how he can be so irresponsible, that I take care of this dog almost by myself and I couldn’t trust him with anything apparently. He apologized but tells me I’m overreacting and that I’m actually stressed about my grandma’s situation. I said yeah I’m upset about that, but also about you. I remind him that the health of our dog is important and he shouldn’t depend on me to remind him to take care of him.

He apologized and offer to take our dog today to the vet for a check up on his ears. I said ok, give him the address and time so he take him to the vet.

When I came back to the apartment he acts like nothing happened. He even asked me how the appointment went. I said why you want to know? You don’t even care. And a big argument started.

I end up telling to him that if we break up, the dog stays with me since he seems not to be able to take care of him or even cared to wake up to take him to his appointment after HE offered. He gets extremely upsted and tells me I’m being unfair and that he is his dog too.

3694,Asshole,"3 years since the split. We share them 50/50. My ex has a job with long, shit hours but because of that they have a lot of money. On their weeks they barely spend time with the kids unless it’s the weekend, but the kids LOVE my ex and think their house is like a playground. I spend a lot of time with them and teach them so many things but it’s like my house is the boring, normal life house and ex’s house is the party house. The kids are 4, 6 and 10. 

For example, my ex hired two babysitters to take care of the kids while they’re at work. Except ex is paying extra to use Elsa and Anna impersonators instead of regular babysitters. 4 and 6 year olds LOVE frozen and always tell me about them. 

10 year old loves to play games. Ex I think has a big projector screen to play games on, so now my son is treating my TV like the downgraded version. He likes to invite his friends to play at ex’s house but not my house as much. 

Ex takes them to Disneyland roughly once a month. I can’t afford that. 

I mostly make meals for the family. Ex has a lot of food delivered, never properly learned to cook. The kids have asked me to order food from the places my ex likes but again, I can’t afford that. Once a week or so is fine but regularly spending $100 on the family’s meal is too much.

Lots of things like this. I had enough and sat the kids down to tell them the important thing in life is time together.  I told them that when ex pays for these things all the time that is not the way to a happy family and it’s better to have a parent who can be with you than a parent who is at work all the time.

It's so ugly, you should try getting some plastic surgery!!""

I always hated when he did it, because despite the fact he was 'joking', I took it to heart. I don't want to pin the blame on him for everything, but something tells me that him doing this could have contributed to my severe lack of a self esteem now that I am older

9561,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account bc I like keeping my shit separate.

So I (18F) have a sister (15F) who means the world to me.  I say this to set the precedent that I don't bear any resentment towards her, it's just this situation.

Long story short: Had a skin condition that caused ugly cystic acne. This and untreated depression/anxiety made my early teens a spiral of self-hatred and frequent manic episodes of screaming, sobbing, and locking myself away so no one could see how ""hideous"" I was. I put chemicals on my face, refused to let my own family see me. A mess.

I  got treated for this and it got better.  I still have worse skin than my peers, but nothing like what it was, and my own appearance isnt a trigger anymore. Still, it can be a bit touchy.

My sister has  perfect skin, like natural foundation. We actually clown each other back and forth about it: She'll tease me about being jealous and having a ""54 step routine"" and I tell her I'll be the one laughing when we're 60 and she looks like a prune.

Recently she's been having skin troubles. Have you ever gotten those little red irritation bumps? She has 1, on her forehead. She has been complaining... a lot. Like, a lot a lot. Every time she sees a mirror she starts talking to me about how ""gross"" her skin is being and how she's ""so broken out"". 

At first I sort of just laughed and gave a sarcastic ""Haha that's my skin on a good day"" because yeah. My skin when it's doing great doesnt look as good as this ""gross, broken out mess"" she's describing. Though afterwards, I did tell her seriously that pimples like that are pretty normal, and she looks fine.

But she won't stop. It's every day. She's not even asking for advice on taking care of it: She just wants to tell me how broken out and nasty her skin looks because she has one pimple. 

 Yesterday night when she started for the 80th time I just rolled my eyes and didnt respond (I didn't think she was looking at me) and she got really upset.

 She said she didn't know why I always did this, and that I was being really insensitive. I told her I just thought she was being a bit silly over one pimple, and that it was impossible for me to not get a little upset, considering how bad my skin is in comparison. She got even more pissed, and said ""Just because my skin is better than yours doesnt mean I'm not allowed to have problems!""

I told her  I knew that, but that I couldn't help feeling uncomfortable when she made such a big deal over 1 pimple, considering she *saw* my past issues with my skin. She said I was being oversensitive and needed to stop being self-centered.

 I'm past all of the self-loathing, but listening to this still annoys me and makes me think ""what the fuck does she think of my skin?"". I *know* that she is allowed to have skin problems, and that she can be upset by them, it's just how dramatic she is being, considering how small it is.

He had also been fired from work. He was in the employee room chatting with coworkers, when one of them said “I have to go now, my parents are here to pick me up”. My son responded “that’s impossible, your parents are dead”. I don’t know why he thought that was funny, but that’s not how I raised him. It turns out that the girls parents were actually dead (no, my son was not aware).


I had confiscated all electronics from him because he was gaming too much (like until 2am on school nights and before his 6am work shifts). So I told him to write a new resume to start finding a new job. I allowed him to use my personal laptop to write his resume. I told him he had an hour, and if he didn’t finish it in that hour that he would have to use the public library.

He kept dragging it on by asking for help and saying he didn’t know where to start or what to put on it. I told him that was his problem and to use google.

After the hour he had maybe 1/4 of his resume finished. So I told him to go to the library and finish it there. He flat out refused saying “there are 5 computers in this house, there is no reason for me to have to go to a library when I can do it here.”

So I told him he has two options:

1.	Go to the library and finish his resume.
2.	Leave my house and find somewhere else to stay.

I know she is just looking out for me and really dislikes my dad because he is irresponsible and doesn't do his duty as a father when we were young.

  I find that really annoying because she doesn't know the quantity and quality of homework I get in a day and how stressful it is. The weekends is usually flooded with homework and I just feel like crying whenever I have to cram it all in one night.

5970,Not the A-hole,"This is not my story, it's about a friend of mine who does not have a Reddit account. I don't know if it's valid to post it.

I  have a close friend, whose father got her mom pregnant, and then  basically forgot about them. The guy had 4 kids with 4 different women,  and got married 3 times (the only one he did not marry was the mom of my  friend).

During her first 20 or  so years on earth, her father only met her twice (once was on her 11th  birthday and he had forgot about it, it was just a coincidence) and he  did not pay any alimony for her, no rent support, not sending groceries  once in a while, nothing at all.

When  she was in her early twenties, one of her half-brothers was diagnosed  with Acute Myeloid Leukemia, and he needed marrow transplants and blood  donations for the treatment. The issue was that the only close relative  with the same blood type was her, so she was the best possible donor.  Now, after all these years, her father looked for her, and told her that  her brother needed her help. So, she went overseas to the hospital  where his brother was being treated **(the  treatment cost millions of dollars, and he paid for it, which meant  that the guy was not exactly poor and could have supported her, at least  financially),** and did everything that was asked from her to  help her brother recover, she did not attend university for a year, she  took care of her brother, but unfortunately the kid died. She did this  out of human decency, not expecting any kind of money or retribution.

After  all this, her father paid the remaining tuition towards her university  degree (3 years or so), and told her that he would pay for any  additional education that she wanted to get. So, 8 years later, he paid  for her Masters program tuition fee (I think it's a 4-digit figure, it's  in Europe). **During the last decade, they have only talked twice or thrice a year (Birthdays and New Year's eve)**

Now,  her father and all his family are going on a cruise, and they did not  invite her. They planned everything in April, they leave next week, and  yesterday her older brother told her ""Hey, we are going on a cruise with  my dad, and we are making a homage for him. Could you please write a  letter to him thanking him for being such a good father and for all he  has done for us?""

She told me that  she didn't have any kind of inspiration (of course) and asked me to help her  writing the letter. I told her that I would not do it, because her  father does not deserve any kind of homage or letter from her. Her  answer was that she does not want to behave like  an asshole with her dad and brother, and that her dad paid for her tertiary education.

4525,Not the A-hole,"So, for context I have never had much of a relationship with my paternal grandmother. She was a shitty mom and her sons all grew up with various issues due to her terrible parenting. When I did see her as a kid it was always with my parents there (I think she babysat me all of about five times my entire childhood for a few hours at a time if my parents couldn't find anyone else.) and she'd make comments about my weight and how big my breasts were, or how if I wanted a good life I should marry a wealthy man. To this day she misspells my very common name and calls my sister by the WRONG name entirely. She 's always been rude to my mother, who was only ever nice to her in return. When my parents would argue when I was a kid, it nearly always was because she was calling my dad and asking for money or wanting him to ""do something about"" his brothers. 

My dad passed away five years ago and I saw her at the funeral and three times since. I am in my thirties and I have six children and she's never even met the youngest. Now she's older and has health problems and my uncle has started messaging me and heavily hinting that he wants help taking care of her. I want no part of it. He has one living brother still and I have seven other cousins who were all around her far more than I ever was but I'm the oldest and I have a ton of kids, so surely taking care of one more person shouldn't be an issue for me, in their minds. This uncle literally NEVER has any contact with me unless he's asking for something, usually to do with her.

The other day, one of our mutuals suggested that they could bring some edibles over for a party we were having. My SO made a negative comment about it, and I mentioned that I might actually want to try some. It went downhill very quickly. My SO had a very emotional reaction to me wanting to partake.

Hear me out on this one.

In regards to ages, I’m 17, Dad is 43, and father’s wife 27 or 28.

Six years ago, it came out during couple’s therapy that my father was cheating on my mom and that his mistress was pregnant. My mom initiated divorce. Six months after the divorce was finalized, my father married his now wife and they had three kids. My dad has apologized for his actions and we are still doing therapy, so one day I can truly forgive him.

I do not like my so-called stepmom, but in regards that she is father’s wife, I begrudgingly show respect. I have never called her out of her name until later in this story. If she speaks to me, I will say something back. If I am in her home, I will clean up after myself. However, I will always refer to her as my father’s wife and she will never be a prominent figure in my life. This is something she cannot accept.

I have never let my true feelings about her be known, until the other day. While at my father’ house, she attempted to make a cringe-worthy joke about my girlfriend with the saying “The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice,” and said that I was good enough looking boy and she was confused about why I would go out with a dark-skinned black girl and not someone white like myself. I guess the look on my face told her to shut up, so she changed the subject.

She then revealed that when my dad gets back from his TDY (Temporary Duty Assignment); she had booked a photoshoot for family portraits of us and she wanted to do a special photo of me and her two sons holding signs that say “Don’t mess with her,” with her 2-month-old daughter. I have never been in any of the previous family portraits because I refused to and my Dad said I didn’t have to.

I told her I was not going to participate

She asked why I was being difficult and that just she wanted family pictures with all of her children.

Six years’ worth of hurt came out. I told her she was a fool to ever think I was her child or that I considered her family. From my perspective, she was nothing, but my father’s racist side chick, who had nothing better to do, but chase after a married man and sit on her ass all day. I took it a step further and fully implied that her daughter wasn’t my father’s child because she looks nothing like him.

She turned red and started crying, saying how disrespectful I was and I had no right to talk to her in such a manner. I fully admit I called her a Bitch and stated she didn’t even deserve any respect from me because she didn’t respect my mother’s marriage and if she ever disrespected my girlfriend again, she would live to regret it. After realizing what I had said, I left and haven’t talked to her since.

Everyone that I have talked to say I should at least apologize for calling her a bitch and I don’t mind doing that.  However, certain people say I shouldn’t have gone off on her, because my dad was gone and she just had a baby, etc.

English is not her first language, she speaks enough to get by but her grammar isn't good at all and her vocabulary isn't good either. In the past few months she's sat down to write a novel in English, which is great, I encourage everyone to write and express themselves. She sent a bit to read to her friend who told her ""WOW - you're going to be the next JK Rowling, this is amazing and you need to publish it.""

22113,Not the A-hole,"My sister-in-law (F32) is a graphic designer and she has a bike saddle business. They do a lot of cool saddles in cool designs and have recently started doing saddles for female anatomy. I (F26) am a fitness influencer and PT and I love long distance cycling. I have a few sponsors and I never promise to endorse a brand if they send me stuff, I always make clear that if I cannot endorse their product I will not post anything about it.

My SIL asked if I'd promote the female saddles if she sent me one. I liked all the graphic designs she had but none of them stood out, so I said I'd be happy with whatever she sent. She then had this idea that she'd design one that's branded around my banner vlog and has my channel name on it. I was SO excited.

I got the saddle in mid-may and as soon as I did, I posted on Insta that there'll be a saddle review soon with a short video of me fitting on the saddle. I then got ready for my ride (did London to Brighton and then some) - and the saddle was not comfortable AT ALL. The pain started about 2h in as the saddle rubbed in a bad way. When I got home to shower my pants were 'attached' to my clit by dried blood. The bleed was coming from the hood, luckily. It was so painful and took days to heal. I deleted the insta story and ignored my SIL for the rest of the w/e as I didn't know what to say.

When I told her what happened I said couldn't review. My brother phoned me and told me to vlog about it but to only talk about the design and not my ride, and to never mention my clit to him again. I said I couldn't. I returned the saddle but my SIL mailed it back to me and neither of them have spoken to me since. They've both blocked me on Facebook and insta and won't return calls or reply to texts. I haven't been able to see my nieces or nephew since either. I've left voicemails and text apologies and I'd even do a review to salvage our relationship but mum says they're not ready to hear from me. AITA for standing my ground even though it clearly meant so much to my SIL that I did the review?

Edit: I think I might be the asshole because this clearly meant so much for my SIL and her business, and she put so much time and effort into making the saddle design for me. For me this was just another sponsor.  


Edit 2:  The actual design of the saddle is not one she has made, she has only designed the graphic printed on the saddle. Female anatomies vary quite a lot and I am an ""outie"", so this saddle would be great for someone else and my SIL has used one for a while and she loves it.

I see him get up and get a cup of macaroni to microwave.  Now due to being a little bit of a neat freak, and annoyed when people don't cover their food I told him if he microwaves anything with an exposed top to cover it, since I don't want to be cleaning out dried up food stains month later. As he puts in his little cup I can see the macaroni, uncovered, and no napkin or anything in sight.

Me: Hey do you mind covering that up? I don't want it to splatter.

C: It's fine, there's a line inside so it doesn't spill over.

I reach over and hold onto the microwave door so he can't close it(the whole set was right next to my bed and in arms reach)

Me: Even if that's the case, I'd really appreciate if you'd cover up your food man.

C: I said it's fine. 

He tries to press the door close but I' able to keep it open with one hand. I turn to face him as he starts to raise his voice.

C: Could you please move your hand?"" He asks, while also trying to pry my fingers off.

Me: Could you please cover your food? A simple napkin will suffice, I'm not asking you to get the holy grail.

C: Move your hand, NOW."" At this point I'm using both hands as he equally tries to force the door close and pry my fingers off.

Me: Only when you cover your food, I'm not asking much, cover your food or you can use the public microwave."" I say, sitting up and raising my voice as well.

She messaged me on Monday to let me know that someone in her workplace was selling an iPad for $100. It wasn't the most recent model but it was still in the box and had only been used a couple of times, so I said I'd take it (the culture in her workplace is pretty tight-knit, so no one would ever sell something defective).

She reported it to her boss and there was a short investigation but nothing was found (since it wasn't company property that was stolen, they didn't really give a shit). The building's internal CCTV only covers the corridors, but not the desks, so there was no way of seeing who might have taken it.

Since my sister left it on her desk and didn't think to take it home, I've been reluctant to give her the $100.

My father was very abusive, and of the few memories I have of him, he was often threatening an infant me with a switchblade. As such, I'm very uncomfortable around them. My boyfriend will often point his in my direction, and when I get upset and tell him to stop he says I need to get over it. That I might need to use one some day. That I should know he'd never hurt me. I guess he feels like if he exposes me to it enough, I'll learn to trust that he won't stab me with it? But it's not like I think that to begin with, I'm just uncomfortable around them.

Well, he has a very intense phobia of a specific monster. I don't question it. For some reason, it's much more intense than my mild annoyance/breath stopping moment at the blades.

I informed them that until they stop being entitled spoiled brats that they can wash their own clothes, but not with MY washing machine. I informed them they will be washing all THEIR clothes from now on in the bath tub with dollar store detergent until they start being respectful and I receive an apology for the remarks about picking up their crap near the hamper AND once the detergent runs out they have to use their own money to buy more but they're only allowed to buy it at the dollar store. Then came more whining and bitching 

It's been a week and they still haven't apologized and I'm saving time, money and water on only washing mine and my husband's clothes. My husband said I'm being ""harsh"" but I don't think so. So am I the asshole for teaching my kids a lesson?",1918,9520,0.9,AITA for making my children wash their clothes in the bathtub with dollar store detergent?,bqxie2,2019-05-20 16:08:47,NTA,1716,AITA
12154,Asshole,"So I’m 19 years old. My parents are your typical conservative “old fashioned” parents that think college is for everyone. I actually did great in high school because I took basically the easiest classes there, and got a scholarship for a local school. I also live in Georgia, so that (mixed with HOPE scholarship) made it so I got to go to school for absolutely free. 

Well I did one semester before realizing that’s NOT what I want to do. I didn’t do so hot my first semester, and just dropped out. They weren’t paying any of it so they had no idea. I just told them I’m doing online school now and they never really questioned it. 

Well during that semester off, I got really into camming. It started off as just a little exhibition on gonewild, but it quickly turned into more. I made almost $10,000, after taxes, in the last 3 months, just by selling pictures, videos, cam shows, and (virtual) sugar daddy relationships/girlfriend-experience relationships. I decided I want to do this for the next 3 or so years while my parents think I’m in school, build a nice comfortable safety net for my future, then tell the truth. Telling them the truth now doesn’t really seem like an option, because as I said, they’re your typical conservatives, and will be absolutely **LIVID** and disowned me if they knew what I was doing.

18200,Not the A-hole,"TLDR: Friend wants to move in with new baby.

I own my house outright and my friend Lana rented a room from me, full furnished, with attached bathroom, shared kitchen, living space, laundry, backyard, garage etc. She will be moving out in a  few months as she is relocating and has contacted a friend of hers Abby to take over the rent. We have not signed any papers and had a verbal discussion when she visited my house. We recently found a week ago that Abby is one month pregnant and did not want anyone to know before she moved in. Her boyfriend is in the picture and would like to live with her and her baby. Her roommates are forcing her to quit her lease as they do not want to live with a baby.
The thing is, she did not mention the baby or that her boyfriend would be moving in when she came to discuss living in my house.
I do not want to live with a baby or her boyfriend no matter what. My house is not baby friendly and I do not want the hassle of a little person in my space. Babies take a lot of space and make noise too. And I value my privacy and lifestyle.
I called Abby yesterday and told her that I was rescinding my offer and will be looking for another renter. She started crying and said I can't do that, and now she doesn't have place to live, I'm making her homeless. A few of her other friends have called and asked me to reconsider.
Lana still has a few more months to go and she's as flabbergasted as I am. As I am not throwing Abby out of her housing, and she has plenty of time to look for her new place.
I'm here because a close friend of mine just called me and asked me to reconsider and called me an AH as I was not willing. She said I should help someone who clearly needs help and with a baby on the way is vulnerable.

I don’t hate people; I’m just horrified of social interaction (most likely because of the above and people were horrible to me as a kid).

For Christmas, I asked for a pair of headphones so the long walks from my house to my job could be a little more bearable (it takes about 50 minutes to get there in the morning). I was expecting a cheap pair of £15 headphones or something but to my surprise, my grandpa generously surprised me with a brand new pair of ultraviolet beats solo3. I love them and I promised myself that I wouldn’t let his money go to waste and I would get as much use out of them as possible.

*Context over, here’s the important stuff*:

I wear these headphones just about everywhere I can get away with because noisy places in public overwhelm me and it’s nice to have something muffle the sound. Also, it’s always nice to have a distraction whenever being around people is too much.

I’ve started walking these into stores and just wearing them, zoning out all of the people talking. It makes something that is normally stressful into a breeze. I only ever shop at stores  with self checkouts available, so I didn’t think it was a problem.
 
However, a friend mentioned to me, that at her workplace, her co worker had actually started crying because someone was walking into the store and ignoring her. She told me she thought people who walked into the store and didn’t want to talk, were assholes (personally whenever that happened at work I was relieved but I’m weird) and that everyone thinks you’re an asshole when you do that .

I realised I had been walking through that same store almost daily and chances are I had completely zoned out someone who I wasn’t aware wanted to talk to me and I must of looked like some asshole who thought I was to important to talk to a retail employee. I probably ignored a couple of people and made them feel like that but at the same time I should be able to get a packet of crisps without being uncomfortable.

8849,Not the A-hole,"Yesterday my girlfriend and I were dog sitting for one of her old neighbors. When we took the dogs outside we found a stray starving skin and bones cat meowing loud in the back yard. We brought it some food and water and it ate and drank it up and was very friendly with us. We called SPCA and animal rescue but unfortunately neither were accepting cats at this time.

We took it inside and made an appointment with a nearby emergency animal hospital to find out if it was sick with anything serious or had a chance at survival. The vet told us that it had neurological deficiencies, kidney failure, polyps in both its ears and was in extreme stages of dehydration and starvation. She offered multiple times to euthanize the cat for us but we couldn't bring ourselves to do it because she said it wasnt in pain from it's current injuries. 

We brought it home that night and after we got a call from the vet saying it passed all the necessary blood tests, we went out and bought it all new stuff. Wet and dry food, food bowls, kitty litter and box, and some other new stuff. It ate and drank all night and snuggled with me and my girlfriend. 

The next day we house sat again and talked to a neighbor who informed us that the cat was a different neighbors that leaves it outside.

What do we do? The vet said the cat would've died if it was outside any longer and were having a moral dilemma on keeping it in a safe home where it will be loved and cared for or giving it back to its rightful owners who let it almost die outside.

It looked a bit like me, but with darker skin and black hair, I told him I didn’t recall taking the picture jokingly and he told me it was his other kid Gavin

On the way to the beach he told me how he had hooked up with a woman before he met his wife and they had a massive fight due to him not wanting to give up his dream of being a musician to move out of state with her 

So he had found out he had another kid and told me I couldn’t tell his wife. Being a dumb kid I swore I wouldn’t 

Fast forward to two weeks ago, I’m on Facebook and I get a friend request from Gavin (16M), I didn’t realize who it was at first and was going to delete the request but then I recognized the picture and accepted 

We began talking and he seems like a really great kid,I told him a bit about his sister (12F) And the other nieces and nephews, he told me he was trying to get into contact with my brother (his dad) but that my brother hasn’t responded, I felt really bad cause myself and my siblings all grew up without our father so I went to talk with Jake

He wasn’t too keen about me talking with his kid, my defense was he was my nephew, Jake didn’t like that and told me he hadn’t told his wife at all or his daughter 

I told him that he needs to be a father to his son, then Jake tried to play coy and said Gavin might not actually be his kid, and implied that Gavin’s mom was a whore, this pissed me off cause our father did the same thing with my older brother Charlie.

We argued back and forth and were pretty loud causIng my niece to come outside, she heard me yell “He’s your goddamn son Jake!” Honestly I didn’t know anyone was home besides Jake
My niece got very upset and I ended up being made to leave, I called my other brother Derek and he told me I should have minded my business

* He's suddenly gone very lethargic very quickly. He'll get up, sit on his chair for about an hour and be that tired that he'll sleep for another 3 or 4 hours but will still be awake all night long. I've suggested for him to go on walks as simple but effective exercise that will tire him out so he'll sleep at least 6 to 8 hours at night. He declines because he's tired
* He's stopped eating. This concerned me, he says that it's because he has zero appetite. I tried to make sure he was eating right when I first noticed this back around last December time. He has obviously thinned out beyond belief (you can see an uncomfortable number of bones). I also believe that this might be why he's tired all day
* He drinks literally all the liquid I buy from my food shop and then some. Like, he'll say he's that thirsty and has a really dry throat when he drinks a two litre bottle of Coke in literally two or three attempts. A literal sip for him is essentially drinking a full pint
* He complains about having to go toilet more often. I told him that this was because of the amount that he drinks. We had to stop twice when I was in the car with him the other day, the distance wasn't even two miles

503,Everyone Sucks,"I know that the title reads poorly, but please hear me out.

About a month ago, I (25M) was approached by my fiancée's (23F) best friend, we'll call her Sarah. Sarah has always been the wild friend of the group. I'm not the biggest fan of having her around because it usually results in her saying or doing things that make other people uncomfortable. Sarah sent me the following text: ""Hey (OP)! The bachelorette part is coming up next month and after talking with the other ladies, we thought it would be funny to have one of the gifts be a customized dildo that you make for her"".

Now, after reading that text multiple times, I had major reservations given what I know about Sarah. However, she protested and said that it would be good natured fun for my fiancée so I agreed.

Sarah came over to my apartment about a week later with a slightly different plan. She wanted to give four, yes four, different color molds of my member to my fiancée. She said she spent around $200 on the DIY kits and asked that I split it in half. At this point, I had been working up the confidence so I was all in. Thankfully, it was a relatively painless process. Sarah prepped the molds and I went to another room to do the deed. The molds turned out great and I thought the plan was actually working.

This past Friday, the bachelorette party was nearly called off (they cancelled most of their plans due to what's currently happening) so they spent the evening drinking in my fiancée's apartment. I had texted my fiancée earlier in the night telling her to have fun and expect a special surprise from me that Sarah would give her in private. I could not have been more wrong.

Apparently, Sarah had decided to change her plans and pulled out gift bags with party favors for each of the guests (who included both of my sisters and my fiancée's younger sister). Sarah had placed the customized molds of my johnson in four random bags out of the 8 girls present. My fiancée did not receive one and has to watch my sister holding a skin colored mold of my penis while Sarah drunkenly tells everyone that it was, in fact, mine. She tells everyone that it was my idea. It also turns out that no one else was consulted, so it is Sarah's word against mine.

It's been nearly 48 hours and my fiancée will not speak to me. My own family has now heard the story and both my sisters said that it was a stupid prank. Literally the only person who has texted me was my fiancée's sister who thought it was funny....

So verdict? I do feel some sense of responsibility for not thinking of this outcome.

TL;DR: I mistakenly trusted my fiancée's maid of honor and she distributed molds of my dick to my fiancée's friends and sister and accused me of planning the entire thing.

20960,Not the A-hole,"This is perhaps the most bizarre AITA post I have ever written but I’m honestly so confused. Like I feel like I can’t possibly be TA, but then sometimes people are too blind to see their own flaws so maybe I really am. 

For as long as I can remember I’ve had this “quirk” I guess you could call that I never snack on anything other than cucumber. I shouldn’t say never technically since socially I’ll get ice cream or eat a few chips at a party, I’m not a picky eater by any means but my snack of choice has always been cucumbers. I eat pretty healthily anyways so a lot of fruits and veggies are a part of my diet. Since veggies are lower in calories I have to eat a lot of them to eat enough, so I’ll usually have some sliced cucumber in my purse that I munch on throughout the day and I’ll always have a cucumber in my car that I just eat whole when I’m driving. I go through several cucumber daily. Although it’s not healthy, I’ve had days where I’ve felt really depressed and overwhelmed and have binge eaten nothing but cucumber. I think I’ve eaten perhaps 35 on very extreme days.

Recently this “quirk” has begun to drive my (22f) bf (33m) of 6 months insane (his words not mine). He says it’s highly inappropriate to carry them everywhere with me. We spent last weekend at his parent’s lake house and I provided my own cucumber to snack on. One night before bed I was in my room knowing on a cucumber like a savage when his mother walked in. Under normal circumstances I never  would eat that around others, I’d slice it up. She was puzzled, but chucked and said “my you do like cucumber.”  My boyfriend later told me that I humiliated him with my childish and immature eating habits. 

I told him that his mom caught me in a low moment, he was being ridiculous, since he eats a bag of chips everyday and I don’t bat an eye. He told me that chips were a normal snack and whole cucumbers were deranged. He told me I needed to stop eating cucumbers and that my behavior was becoming a deal breaker for him. I feel really bothered, but I think cucumbers are a weird hill to die and I don’t want to lose my relationship. So AITA?

Edit: I’d just like to add that my boyfriend has never expressed any issue with my cucumber habits before now. The incident in question was because around 8PM I was getting really hungry and I don’t know his family super well so I didn’t want to go rummaging/ask for a snack and I didn’t want to bother them by asking for a cutting board or something to cut up my cucumber because of well, mild social anxiety. So I shut myself in the guest room and figured I’d just snack on a cucumber quick. I don’t usually go hide and eat cucumbers haha. But then his mom walked in looking for my bf presumably and was a little surprised but seemed amused and not upset or anything. I honestly didn’t think it’d turn into such a big deal for him",621,2001,0.95,AITA for eating too many cucumbers,i1q194,2020-08-01 10:21:56,NTA,2869,AITA

My immediate family was never close to my Korean side of the family, but we were close to my grandfather.

11051,No A-holes here,"So we were 13 months into searching for a house. Came across a brand new builder that had two houses being built next to each other in the area we wanted. Both were 3BR house that were $20K different in prices. We chose the cheaper house due to layout and lighting (but had less square footage). But really debated between both houses.   

We were first to build with them so they were initially great about upgrades but always felt the need to let us know they wouldn’t do this for every house- only ours since that was the beauty of customizing a house with them. Towards the end when we wanted things (things they initially promised were “included”) they started to get shitty and said these things would have to come out of our “budget” for upgrades. Let me say we picked everything- floor, light fixtures, knobs, paint colors, cabinets etc. We spent 8 hours just picking and finding the lights in the house. Searched for the perfect pieces and then sent link to builder to buy items for house.   

Fast forward- we move in to house in April. Other house is nearly finished but not yet sold. We went to open house and literally they got every single one of our upgrades (without having to negotiate for it). They have the same exact kitchen cabinets including handles (these are also in all the bathrooms) as well as the same bathroom lights we picked (searched and found online). We overheard them hint that the house price is now decreasing again (which means it will be comparable to ours) and they are offering a custom trek deck to the buyer of neighboring house as well as a “large incentive gift” (we didn’t get either of these).

We are rather annoyed as now the house next to ours is slightly bigger, looks incredibly similar to ours inside and they get a trek deck for same price.   Is it reasonable for us to be annoyed with this? We feel like although we got to “customize” our home given that they mimicked everything next door it looks more like their brand now than our personal picks (I.e. they’re emulating our choices and making these items staples to their brand). We spent a ton of time picking everything out for the neighbors to get the same, pay the same and then actually get a deck out of it (we did not get this).",36,41,0.9,AITA for getting annoyed with our custom home builder for copying our selections in the house next door,by7cc5,2019-06-08 12:09:05,NAH,2243,AITA
8156,Asshole,"My friends and I (10 people, just to give an idea of the size) get all together every once in a while to just hang out and have a good time. One of my closer friends in the group has a girlfriend that mine hates to the bone. We'll call her Lisa.

Lisa has done some pretty questionable shit to my girlfriend. She's a nice person overall but has stuck her nose in some of my girlfriend's relationships too deep and has done some damage. I'll spare the details, but I am fully on my girlfriend's side in this. We can't totally cut her off though since she's the girlfriend of one of the guys.

Anyway, while we're all hanging out, Lisa starts talking to me and we just have a normal conversation. I'm a pretty easy going guy so I ask the usual ""how is everything"", make a few jokes, we show each other some funny memes on our phone, then the rest of the party continues. Lasted like 10 minutes I'd say

My girlfriend the next day starts telling me how upset she was that I ""fed Lisa the attention she craves so much"", and how I shouldn't crack jokes with her and make conversation with her. She said I should just be blunt with her and give the shortest replies possible whenever it's my turn to talk.

I'm here to have fun. I also don't want to disrespect my friend's girlfriend by being a dick to her. To top it off, I don't wanna start any bad vibes in this party just to please my girlfriend. I could probably find a way to do it subtly if we're in a club or something, but we're literally just 10, in a house.

20473,Not the A-hole,"Background info: in 2016 I was dating someone different than who I'm with now for 3 years before she moved for an internship. Unfortunately, about six months before she actually moved, her house got broken into one night, and the thief left the door open and her beloved cat got out, we never saw him again. My poor ex gf was absolutely devastated by this and cried herself to sleep many a night. It was hard to watch her go through that.

OR SO I THOUGHT

It's been several years since we split and I recently started seeing this girl I met at a bar, when she initially invited me over I realized that she lived in the same neighborhood as my ex used to and chuckled but didn't really think about it. So we hang out, have a great night, and I leave later on bc we both have to work the next morning, as I'm leaving I notice there's a cat sitting under my gf's carport and figure it must be hers. Fast forward to next afternoon, we hang out after work during the day. When I pull back up to her house I see the cat again and I call it so I can pet it. As the cat gets closer to me I was shocked, it looked EXACTLY like my ex gf's cat. Her cat had some pretty distinct traits imo, 2 different colored eyes, 3 pink paws with the front right paw being black, and a docked tail now I know coincidences happen but there's just no way, we live in a pretty small town. So I go in and greet my gf and I ask her about the cat, she says it was a 'stray' who randomly showed up one day and she kept it. I ask when, she says probably sometime in 2016. I tell her that the cat isn't a stray, that I know the owner and they've been missing that cat for a really long time. At first she seems accepting, then she asks me who the owner is and I naively said it was my ex. Idk why but her demeanor just changed after that, and she in no uncertain terms basically told me ""fuck her feelings"" when I asked if she was planning on returning the cat. I dropped it to keep the peace, but snuck back over to my gfs house that night. When I got there I held my hand out and called him by his original name and he ran right up to me. I would be willing to bet a high amount of $ that is absolutely my ex-gfs cat. So I just grabbed the cat and got in my car and drove back home, after I got home I called my ex and I told her I had found her cat. She moved back after her internship but to a different county, after she heard she immediately got in her car and came over. When the cat saw her it seemed so happy, like it recognized her. She took him home and that was the end of it for that night. After my gf didn't see him outside at all, all day she became suspicious and asked me if I saw him. So I told her that I took him back to his owner, bc I didn't want her worrying over him. She lost it on me, told me to never contact her again, and now all of her friends are harassing me and my friends are calling me TA, but I stand by what I did!

20827,Not the A-hole,"This happened about two weeks ago. I (22F) have been dating my wife (fiancee at the time of the incident) (23F) for 8 years now. After corona hit, we lost several deposits, and realized we were basically married anyway, so why not just have a small ceremony and make it official already. (Before I get crucified for having a party during corona, we only had eight people in attendance, including us and our ""venue"" (aka our backyard) was spacious enough to seat people who weren't already quarantined together 6 feet away from each other (and masks were required).)

Anyway, I asked for a really lowkey bachelorette party involving marathoning a couple movies w/ my two best friends, ordering in from my favorite restaurant and playing card games. However, when it came time for the party, I walked in to her apartment and EVERYTHING was penis-themed. Penis cake, penis balloons, a home-made game that was literally pinning a dick on a half-naked guy (like pin the tail on the donkey). I was shocked and pissed, but I'm the biggest pushover on the entire planet so I stayed. I asked her why she did it and she said that she wanted to ""show me what I'm missing out on.""

I was honestly about to leave but she apologized profusely and told me to just think of them as strap-ons. Didn't work super well, but she's been my best friend literally since I was born, so I decided to let this one slide. Anyway, we were marathoning movies and I'd almost forgotten I was drinking from a penis straw when someone knocked on our door. Yeah. She ordered a stripper. A MALE stripper. That's when I saw red and started screaming at her for being homophobic and told her she was not invited to my wedding any longer. I got married a week and a half ago and haven't spoken to her since my bachelorette party. My wife thinks I should let myself cool down and have a rational conversation with my friend. She was the first person I was out to and besides this incident, has never been anything but supportive.

My mom was raised in a very...interesting household to say the least. She was raised in a very typical Middle Eastern way, my grandmother was (and still is) very strict with her. Therefore, when my mom had me she wanted to raise me differently than she had been. 


We barely went to see my grandparents and my mom claims no connection to that part of her heritage. As a result, I haven't had any connection either. 


Over the past year or so I've been wanting to change that though. I've been cooking traditional Iranian foods, have been teaching myself Farsi, and just been learning about the culture in general. (I am not Muslim or even religious at all if that's something important to include). 


Full discretion I do not look Middle Eastern. When most people try to guess where I'm from they usually think I'm half white and Mexican.


I was telling my friend, who is fully Middle Eastern, how I've been coming along learning Farsi, and she got very annoyed with me. She told me how tired of ""white people trying to steal the parts of culture that they like"" and how disrespectful it was, especially because I didn't grow up in a traditional brown household.

2074,Not the A-hole,"I \[23M\] am getting married next summer and my fiancee \[22F\] and I are still in the planning stages of our wedding - including still divvying out roles for our family/friends. My cousin Meagan has had 2 kids since getting married a few years ago, Lily and Michael. Given that they are the youngest family members out of both my fiancee's family and mine, we were talking about our wedding during a family BBQ and how the guest list was coming along. I let them know that it's slowly but surely coming together and in that moment talked about possibly having Michael be our ring bearer and Lily be our flower girl. Everyone in our family thought this would be a fun/cute idea . . .

 . . . Everyone except my Aunt Bri and her 12 year old son (my cousin) Andrew. Andrew is a brat; he is a really an only child despite having two older siblings and always throws fits whenever he doesn't get his way - like dragging himself on the ground, hiding/running away, ignoring people, and pouting/crying. My Aunt Bri and Uncle Ken hardly do anything to address these fits other than threatening to go home. They don't give a shit about what kind of video games he plays, how he talks back to them or the rest of our family (light cursing and addressing family by first name rather than Aunt \[My mom's name\] or Grandma \[My Grandma's name\]). There is no way around this, kid is just a pain in the ass. He was born well after my cousin Meagan and her older brother Patrick were (age difference of at least 12+ years between them) and so has sort of always gotten his way growing up with virtually no siblings in the picture. 

Later during my family visit, my  grandma pulled me aside and asked if I had any plans to include Andrew in our wedding in anyway. I asked why. My grandma then mentioned that I made my Aunt/Uncle/Andrew a little upset by offering my cousins toddlers roles in the wedding but not offering Andrew a special role in the wedding as a little groomsmen or something else and that I should really ask him/do something special for him like get him a toy while asking.

I turned to my Grandma and my mom - who was also in on the conversation - and I said ""No. I honestly don't think Andrew deserves any kind of special role. Kid is a spoiled brat to be honest and I just can't see him not throwing some kind of fit or crying about something on the day of our wedding."" My mom agreed with me as she has always felt the same way about her nephew and like me, felt that he would not be respectful/behaved and would try to make it about him - the way he always tries to. My grandma, however, slightly disagreed and said that I should really consider it and that ""he is family.""

17075,Asshole,"Me (25 M) and my family live in a fairly small town. It‘s one of those places where everyone knows everyone and word always spreads fast. Of course that can be annoying sometimes, but oh well.
Two years ago my little brother (16 M) came out as gay. Everyone in our family immediately accepted him, but of course that didn’t stop other people from gossiping and talking shit.

I‘ve always been very close to my little brother. He used to get bullied in school for being „too feminine“ (it‘s better now, but some guys are still rude to him), so I always saw it as my responsibility to look out for him and keep him safe from those assholes. After coming out to us and his friends, his self-esteem has improved a lot  though and I‘m super proud of him!

One thing my brother loves is make-up. From what I can see he‘s pretty good with it too (we always joke about him becoming a Youtube MUA after he graduates) and even though I don’t know too much about this kinda stuff, it makes me happy that he‘s found a hobby.

A few weeks ago, my brother was hanging out with friends and left the house with full make-up on (brows, eyeshadow, eyeliner, etc.). When he got back, he told me some guys he ran into were really rude to him and called him names. He was scared they would get violent so he just ran away. I comforted him and added that it might be a good idea to stop wearing make-up in public and just do it at home for now. He was pretty upset by that and accused me of victim blaming and trying to stop him from expressing himself. Before I could even say anything he left the room and now refuses to speak to me.

I feel like my brother twisted my words here. He can do whatever he wants as long as he‘s happy and not inconveniencing someone else. The reason why I suggested it is because I‘m scared something might happen to him. I don’t want him to get assaulted or insulted by close-minded people when he‘s outside and I‘m not there to protect him.
On the other hand, maybe I went about it the wrong way and shouldn’t have said something like that at all, idk.

15401,Not the A-hole,"I do not post a lot so I am sorry if the format is wrong also on mobile. 

Backstory: In 2014 my wife (29F) and I (29M) got custody of her sisters 5 children. Shortly after that we found out we were going to have our first child. So we went from 0 to 6 kids in 9 months. Well part of getting custody was setting up child support. We both knew that neither parent would likely pay anything so we told the court to set the support at $550 a month for each parent. This is not a lot of child support for 5 kids and we hoped by setting it low we may be able to get something. We live in NC and the children’s parents live in TX.

In 2018 my parents were involved in a really bad accident and we lost my mom. I was in TX with my family and my wife made arrangements with her sister to stay with the children at our home in NC while she consoled me in TX. This lead to her sister trying to forcibly regain custody by saying I was abusive and that we abandoned the kids. Long story short everything she did failed, however she irreparably damaged our relationship with her. We wanted nothing to do with her anymore and decided to help get the kids set up and moved to their Dads house in TX.

That all ended around Aug. 2018 when the dad let my SIL see them and she never brought them back to him. After that things went quite from them. We contacted the child support office and informed them that we no longer had the kids so that they would stop trying to collect more child support. That stopped the child support that the parents owed from growing, but they still owe arrears. Fast forward to today when my wife is hysterical because she is getting texts from the kids dad because he finally got a job and is being told that he is going to have his paycheck garnished to pay arrears.

5525,Not the A-hole,"She's getting married in December and she and the groom (30m) want me as a groomsman. They had us go to get suits and the idea is that all the groomsmen and bridesmaids wear different shades of light to medium blue and the groom wears navy. They found a suit shop that sells suits that are identical but come in all different colours. Their son is in a baby blue one, his older brother in slightly darker shade, then his cousin in a slightly darker shade than that, then me in a darker shade than that, and his best man is in a normal shade of blue, with the groom in navy, so it starts really light and gets darker until you get to the groom. I have to admit it looks cool when you get the full effect. It's all a really delicate colour scheme that I cannot be the one to mess up, and as the suits have to be identical aside from the colour they all have to be bought at the same place, and it's just too expensive.

Just the jacket and trousers come to about £240, the shoes are another £100, the waistcoat is around £75, the shirt is £55, and the tie and pocket square come to £25. This outfit, (which I will never wear again after this as it's really uncomfortable) costs more than double my entire wardrobe. The store also charges extra for tailoring, which I think is a rip off when I'm already being asked to put nearly £500 towards a suit. I've also found out they want to do a destination bachelor party (Vegas) and we're all expected to pay our way.

I don't have this kind of money, simple as. I found a suit online that wasn't exactly the same but looked a lot like it in the right shade of blue and asked my sister if this would work, and she blew up at me, saying it was her wedding and she needed me in uniform. I said I couldn't afford it and she said she wouldn't pay for it, when I never asked her to. Our parents asked why she was mad at me and I told them, and they're on her side, saying that I should just buy the suit, but I literally don't have the money. I am barely scraping by, my account is in overdraft, and I don't even have money to buy food this week, I'm having to wait until next Friday, which is payday, and live off what's in my kitchen already until then.

I think the right thing to do at this stage is to say to my sister ""I'm sorry, I can't afford to be a groomsman"" and bow out. They have a few months to replace me and I'd still go, in the suit I already own, as a guest, because while I would love to be involved and standing at the front while my sister gets married, I literally can't afford to.

20148,Not the A-hole,"
I know how the title sounds!

I’ve been with my husband since I was 17 and he was 20, his sister is 4 years younger than him.

3 years into our relationship we got married, I’m 28 now.

I gave birth 8 months ago and I’m currently 6months pregnant with our second.

Two years  ago my husbands sister lost her flat, she had a 2 year old so I of course agreed to let her stay with us- rent for her is £200 a month (which barely covers her food) and we specified she would have to tidy up after herself and her child because my husband and I both work full time.

I’ve been off for a while now, I’m still working from home though but no longer go into the office and while his sister has never been the tidiest (she did the bare minimum) she now does absolutely nothing apart from making a mess.

My husband helps out sometimes but, bless his heart, he can burn water and he has no back bone meaning despite only having one child at the moment I’m tidying up after two, three if you count his sister.

My husband wants to give his sister a break since she’s not been late on rent and helps us out sometimes so we can have a day for ourselves (we pay her £11 an hour for that) 

Since getting pregnant with our second all she’s done is talk down to me, we’ve had some *heated* arguments, my husband tends to stay neutral.

I’m sick of her, I’ve mentioned it to the both of them - if she isn’t out by January I’m leaving, if she continues giving me attitude she can leave by October.

My husband is now upset for “alienating” his sister who’s trying to get her life back on track (saving for a house, considering going  university and working) 

At this stage I don’t care if she starts tidying up after herself, I’m done but now I’m wondering if I’m being harsh and overreacting.

Within the past couple of months M has been making some really serious mistakes. Things like putting rent money into the wrong accounts, lost really important city inspection papers, amongst other things. 

M has been written up more than once, and our company has a 3 strike policy for write ups (write ups are only for large offenses and used only if an employee has already been warned about something). Today M really messed up and basically made it sound like our rental criteria was breaking Fair Housing laws and a bunch of other local laws. It’s a huge mess up, like we had to call company lawyers 

I’m getting promoted to a higher position, and because of that my current boss let me know the company is going to be letting M go by the end of the week.

13053,No A-holes here,"My brother, who I have a very strong bond and good relationship with, has been trying for years to get his wife pregnant, all to no avail. It’s believed that he’s sterile, and this saddens him (and me) very greatly. A while ago, they accepted that he is unlikely to ever have biological children, and began looking for a sperm donor. But just recently, they posed a new, unconventional idea to me - that **I** be the donor.

Asking your brother to donate sperm for you might be an odd or even inappropriate request in most circumstances, but ours is a unique one - we are identical twins. We share 100% identical DNA, and thus any child born of my sperm would be related to my brother **every bit as much** as his own child from his own sperm would. This would not be the case with regular brothers, where the baby would be related as a nephew/niece to him. And because of this, the child wouldn’t find out about the “donation” from one of those home DNA tests so many people are taking now - my brother and I both would show up as the father on any DNA test because of our identical DNA.

My brother views having an identical twin as a great stroke of luck in this situation, and an opportunity to be able to have his own children after all. Despite his enthusiasm, I’m not so sure about the whole thing. I haven’t officially declined; I just told him that “I’ll think about it.” I’m married, and just think the whole thing seems a bit weird and “off”.

4013,Not the A-hole,"Bought a $300 4k TV. We got home and I noticed a small dent/cut in the middle back of the box. I thought it's probably nothing and I could always return it if there were any problems. You couldn't tell until it was turned on, but when we did it was completely shattered. Especially in the middle where the box dent was. I loaded it into my own car, and there was nothing to cause the dent anywhere, kept it vertical - although it was a snug fit.

I called the next morning, they said no problem, bring it back for an exchange. 

Brought it back and the cust service woman is nice enough, takes it out and plugs it in. She had  a coworker come look, then they got the manager. The manager looked and left for a minute. Then came back with the news I knew was coming seeing as how long it was taking: ""We can't do anything for you because our employee checked the box before it left the store - so the dent must have happened after that. We can give you a discount on a new TV"". I told her to check the cameras from last night and show me there is no dent in the box I received. If no dent I'll gladly leave with the broken TV. Of course she declined, saying they don't do that with customers. At this point I was losing it. The other employees stared at the ground. I got into an argument tone, but not yelling. A couple lines I dropped were ""So you're calling me a liar? Your employee doesn't make mistakes?"" And ""why would I not shop at Amazon and have it delivered to my door for the same price? There would be no questions if it arrived damaged."" She said I could call corporate or see another manager, which one would I like? I said both, get me the other manager. They prob knew I was staying at that counter until the police take me out.

2638,No A-holes here,"Hi, English isn't my native language so I could get the grammar wrong.

Before work this morning I had to go to doctor's office to pick up a referral paper. There wasn't anyone there except for a man who looked kind of lost and acted weird.

I thought he might be drunk or homeless, since I don't live in the best neighborhood and there's a lot of these people around bus and train stations, stores, buses etc. Normally I don't like interacting with them.

So I put in my earphones to pretend I wasn't seeing or hearing him. He still came over and started saying something, but even when I removed my earphones I couldn't understand his sentences. It sounded like he was slurring and speaking very unclearly.

Basically I didn't realize he was deaf until he pointed to the cochlear implant on his ear. That's why he couldn't speak very well.

I felt really bad because I was giving him the silent treatment assuming he was one of those ""crazy"" people when he just wanted to ask about the doctor's working hours. We sort of found a way to understand each other, he understood me better than vice-versa though.

AITA for acting weird around this man, pretending to not notice him? I feel like I was prejudiced based on his behavior and it's not what I wanted.",16,34,0.88,AITA for not realizing someone was deaf?,dfevdl,2019-10-09 10:00:30,NAH,1257,AITA
14992,Asshole,"Don't attack me yet, just read my post reader. So this happened earlier today and I just wanted some advice. This is really my first time actually posting something Reddit, so forgive me if I have the formatting wrong (on mobile)

So this happened earlier today after I had gone on the bus to go home today (I am currently a junior in highschool) and one of my close friends (also a junior) who I have known pretty much my whole life (we will call her C for this story) sat down next to me. We gave the usual greetings and she got on her phone. A few minutes pass by and she turns to me and shows me a picture of an old friend from elementary school (our friend Z who is a senior) and this is how the interaction went:

C: “Do you remember who this is?”

I look at the photo and say, “No I don't remember”

C: “Remember Z?”

Me: “Yeah, I do, is that her?” 

C: “Yea, it is, and I'm upset about this picture”

The photo she showed me has Z in a pretty sparkeled silver dress, and her mom standing directly behind her holding her waist, wearing a very similar dress.

Me: “What makes you so angry about this photo?”

C: “She gets to take a senior photo with her mom”

Here we go

Me: “So what about it?”

C: “It's unfair how she gets to take a senior photo with her mom and I can't”

Me: “It's not unfair, and you're not the only one without a mom”

C: “Well you have a step mom, I don't” 

Now I wasn't referring to myself when I said she's not the only one without a mom, my parents divorced when I was 5 and consider my step mom as my actual mom

Me: “That's not what I was referring to when I said that. I just know that there are other people who don't have a mom, and sometimes don't even have both parents to take a senior photo with”

C just looked at me in (disbelief?) And shoved her earbuds in and hasn't talked to me since. 

Her mother died when she was only 8 years old, and I understand how hard it is for someone to lose a loved one at that young of an age, but she is 18 now. It's been 10 years since then and she still hasn't gotten over it, so I ask Reddit, Am I The Asshole?

Edit: Id like to point out that she has agreed that she should get support, and others have told her too, but she hasn't done anything about it.

6444,Everyone Sucks,"Some background, my fiance moved in with me about three months ago. She lives about 90 minutes from her family now. She misses her family a lot, but her family hates me for unknown reasons to me. I'll regularly take us to visit her family when we have the time and money (About every two weeks).  
When we visit her family, I might as well not even exist. They don't say hi; they don't acknowledge me. I'm a ghost. I try to start a conversation with them, and they shoot me down with one-word answers. Well my finance, when we're just about to leave, has a habit of asking if she may stay the night this infuriates me as if I knew she was going to do that, I would have just dropped her off. I could have gone home, and cleaned up, worked on a personal project, hung out with my friends or family. No, I decided to spent my Sunday being ignored most of the day.  
So yesterday, we've been hanging out with her family since 11 AM, and it was going on 8:30 PM. I have to go to work at 3:30 AM, and we have a 90-minute car ride ahead of us. Fiance knows this, but right as we're about to leave, she decides to pop the question without warning me or asking me ahead of time, ""Hey, may I stay the night?"". When they allow her to stay, I'd have to go home, go to work then when I get off work, drive back down to pick her up then drive back.  
I told her, no before they even gave her an answer, rude of me. They agreed on no since I was angry and was not going to come to pick her up the next day.  
We finally start to head out now, as we're leaving the fiance is now crying because she misses her family, and I'm an asshole because I did not let her stay. In the middle of going back about 15-minutes out I slammed the brakes and did a U-Turn telling her I'll take her back and she can sit there for a week until I have the gas to come back to get her. She then decided she did not want to be there a week and she just wanted to go home with me.  
Her family has labeled me now as controlling, and I'm isolating her. I take her to see her family roughly every two weeks, even though we can't afford it. She has health issues so she can't drive, and can't work this leaves our money very tight.  
So WIBTA? The fiance is close with her family, I try to keep a good relationship with them, and I try to make sure she can see them regularly. I can't always keep making 90 minutes trips back and forth though. I drive an old 2000's van that has 209,000 miles on it. I bought it for $700.  
Update:  
More people have been asking for more info so I thought I'd update the post with some answers:

\- The only reason why I can think her parents do not like me is that once she moved out. She stopped getting an SSI check. She never got to use the money as her parents had access to her checking account and would withdraw the money on the day it came. I also made sure she created a bank account only she had access to and not her parents.

  
\- The fiance has random undiagnosed seizures sometimes she'll have one a week other times she'll have three a day this stops her from being able to drive or work. She's been seeing a neurologist to get this fixed. She can't drive herself. I'm her only source of transportation when it comes to getting to and back to her family.

  
\- I have learned that slamming the brakes is not a good thing to ever do and,  I'll make sure to apologize for that when I get home, and to never do that again ):",981,3174,0.96,AITA for getting angry at my fiance for not letting her stay the night with her family?,cpb7g6,2019-08-12 11:40:05,ESH,3432,AITA
19562,Not the A-hole,"For context, I'm a body piercer at a tattoo shop &work with professional tattoo artist everyday.  My little sister has a friend whose an artist (not  tattoo artist, but a painting/sketching artist) watched a few YouTube videos, read a couple of books &bought a tattoo machine online to tattoo their friends for the hell of it. 

When my lil sis first told me she got a tattoo I was excited for her because I myself love tattoos, so naturally I wanted to see it. When she sent me a pic I could tell right away that it was done by an amateur. The lines were crooked, you can see where they had a heavier hand making the ink thick & blobby & a lighter hand where the ink was too light to even see/stay. Over all it looked like shit. 

I asked her who/where did she get it. She proudly said her friend did it. At first I was thinking ""okay cool, her friend is an apprentice & is still learning."" No big deal I was proud that my lil sis was furthering their friend's education on a trade you can only learn by doing.  (I have to do the same as piercer). She then proceeds to tell me that her friend isn't an apprentice & is just doing this for fun at her house.

I immediately went off on her on how dangerous that is because of bloodborne pathogens, sanitary/ sterilization that needs to be done in order to keep the artist, person being tattooed & future people to be tattooed safe.  She ensures me that they are being clean/safe by wearing gloves & not reusing needles not realizing that a lot more then PPE ( personal protective equipment)and not reusing needles goes into being properly clean & sanitary. 

She's says I need to respect that this is her closest friend & she trust them. I do respect that she's trusting her friend, I had friends that trusted me when piercing them before I got an apprenticeship myself, but I also told them that if something goes wrong to seek a professional piercer for help because we knew how dangerous this was. ( I literally only pierced one person before my apprenticeship because I understood how fucking up a piercing- even though I studied/ knew the fundamental- could end someone in the hospital).

They are not doing any of that in this case here, it's all fun & games to them. She believes I don't like her tattoos because they look bad. I don't care that they look bad, I care about her being safe.  I'm terrified that she'll get an infection or a bloodborne pathogen!

10221,Asshole,"TLDR - I (22 male) am best friends with John (not real name), who is also 22 male. Now here's the thing, he is incredibly good looking. He's 6''5, muscular and has the face of a greek god. Obviously he gets a lot of attention from girls, and it's not uncommon for servers (usually female ones) to reduce prices on things for him (e.g. drinks, food, etc) or just sometimes not charge him at all.

Well this time we went for a coffee and I ordered a coffee and brownie. I pay for it. Fair game. But then John goes to order the same thing after me. The barista is giggling and flirting hard with him, but what grates me is that she charged him for the coffee but not the brownie. She winked at him and at that point I just saw how unfair it was that I got charged and he didn't, I don't want to sound jealous, but why should I have to pay and he doesn't? 

So I interrupt and say ''Excuse me, you didn't charge him for the brownie''

She looks startled and says ''I'm sorry what?'' so I look her in the eye and tell her ''You didn't charge him. Why not?''. She looks embarrassed and says ''Sorry you're right'' and subsequently charges him.

I'm not the type to say ''Can I speak to your manager please'', and I'm happy that my friend John got a date with that same girl, but I just wasn't going to let him get away with that free brownie whereas I had to pay.

19593,Not the A-hole,"I've (20f) been wanting birth control for a while because I get painful and heavy periods. They're nothing serious, I just really don't want to deal with them. Recently (about a month ago) I got a new boyfriend (19m), and that only further cemented my desire for BC. I started to put my plan into action to get it. Under the health insurance my parents pay for, there would be no out of pocket cost, and I've checked this multiple times. However, as I've been making appointments and whatnot my mom started to be visibly uncomfortable. She would often say things like, ""It feels weird having my daughter get birth control,"" and the like.

Now you have to understand that my mom is very religious, and I grew up in the church. She believes in the whole ""no sex before marriage"" thing, but she knows I no longer believe in her church. I just don't think she wants to accept all of the consequences for that, such as me drinking, swearing, and having sex. 

Now here's where I may be TA. She's fine with me getting BC- as long as it's only for my period. She'll often confront me and say, ""Your period is the only reason why you want BC, right? You're not lying to me, are you? Because you know honesty is the most important thing to me. I've had people lie to me in the past, and I've hated it. But you're a good girl, and I trust you."" During these times, I just just nod my head and say ""Uh-huh"". I know it is lying to her, and I know she hates that, but I don't know what to do. 

So AITA for lying to my mom? Is it wrong for me to not want her to know about my sex life if my parents are paying for the insurance to get the BC? I do feel really bad about lying, but I feel like any talk about sex is just off the table right now.

We seriously committed to each other after Christmas (we had met on tinder in October and had a few loose dates where we REALLY liked one another) and basically it’s been amazing since. Like. Really amazing. 

We both decided to introduce one another as significant others to our parents at the start of April. However my boyfriend had the idea to just throw a family bbq at his place (he has a beautiful new place that he’s just bought and is proud of so I kind of totally get why he wanted to do that) and invite both sets of parents over. 

My mom and dad, who are just your average American older couple I guess and his mom and dad, totally hit it off. I mean. They were like best freaking friends who were on a long lost reunion. It turned out my dad and his dad had gone to a BUNCH of the same obscure band shows when they were younger, and my mom and my bf’s mom both are crazy about a weird specific hobby so it kind of turned into this love fest. 

First I thought it was really cute but then yesterday on the phone my mom casually told me that they had met up for drinks, her and my bf’s mom have been on a  shopping excursion together... the thing is my mom and dad are really popular so I don’t get why they need a new set of friends that are my BOYFRIENDS parents.

10705,No A-holes here,"I (16F) have a friend Grace (16F) who's very emotionally and mentally sensitive, she was abused as a child (which she told me when i was 11 in very extreme detail when we were swimming in a pool) and lives in a very controlling Patriarchal household, Due to that she's got a fear of failure and hates confrontation of any kind. Even if its just me and other friend arguing about if you should bake mac & Cheese  she'll tell us to stop fighting and start getting sensitive even though it was clearly just a joke. 

The problem is that with my friends when we do a test she would start crying or freaking out after that she's failed it and all 3 of us would come to her aid and help her out saying it doesn't matter even though we've all sat the same test and are feeling the same thing she has. Then we get the results and shes got an A, were im sitting with a C and the other two haven't even passed.

This happened quite a few times already when she started crying after an exam and I genuinely couldn't cater to her emotional needs as i was sitting there thinking i messed up really bad. I just didn't say anything and tried to just eat my lunch and ignore her but she kept going about how if she fails it'll ruin her life  and it just got to me and I just snapped at her telling her to get a grip on herself and her fear of failure and that everyone else is going through shit themselves and not everything is about her. I stood up and left and a few of my friends said i shouldn't have confronted her like that and i was an asshole but i didnt know how else i was meant to say anything because everytime i have a serious conversation about her emotional dependance on me with her she says she doesn't have anyone else and its always just a onesided conversation and i feel really terrible and just let it go midway. 

I talked to my mum( a nurse) about her multiple times and she suggested talking about therapy with her but every time i mention it she shoots it down and Im so tired of dealing with all of this emotional draining things especially when she's said some really insensitive things about me and my situation with my dad.

So am I the Asshole? I know i probably should have handled it better but idk what else i was meant to do :/

Kaden didn’t watch where he was going.

I (23f) live alone in a small apartment. Barely twenty steps to get from my stove to my bed.
It’s on the second floor for a two floor building so I only have a balcony and I live directly next to a park (as in it starts at my buildings side fence)
I go to the park often so I know people can kinda see into my apartment but only if they actually look, there are trees and bushes along the fence that obscure direct sight. I also leave my blinds open for natural light.
the first thing I do when I get home, is take off my clothes (bra/jeans or top/pants type thing). After showers I stay in my underwear or just a towel while I do something else. One thing I ALWAYS put on no matter what is undies, I prefer to have them on so I’m not entirely naked. But I am generally 90% nude when I’m home.

Issue: I’ve started getting notes stuck to my door ordering me to ‘put some damn clothes on’ and ‘respect the people living around me’ and that I ‘shouldn’t be running around nude when there are children around.’ No children live in my building.
I ignored the notes because well it’s my apartment.
Yesterday note person finally knocked on my door. Not two minutes after I got home. I wasn’t dressed so I took a minute to find sweatpants and put them on. They continuously knocked the whole time.
When I did finally answer I found my new downstairs neighbour (30/40s) who only moved in maybe 10 days ago. 
My balcony is over his backyard, I wasn’t aware he could see into my apartment, but I wasn’t all that worried because why would he care to look in right?
Wrong. He started yelling at me and always being ‘bare ass naked’ that he hadn’t rented his apartment to live under a whore and that if I didn’t start dressing appropriately for where I was he’d have me kicked out because he “knows the owner of the building” 
I told him ‘it’s my apartment so I get to choose what is appropriate to wear or not and if he wasn’t such a perv looking into my apartment all the time he wouldn’t care’ and shut the door. He kept knocking so I started knocking back (a tactic I learnt from my very immature dad) until he yelled through the door that I was a c*nt and he was calling the landlord.
If he had just nicely informed me he’d seen me walking around and felt uncomfortable with it I would’ve done something. But he was rude so I was rude.

I talked my mum about it because shes in real estate and knows the rules. She said I was turning a mole hill into a mountain and I should’ve just put on some damn pants to get him off my back.

I didn’t make much money while in college so I would spend money on watches around the 20-100 range at most. Once I graduated (in computer science) I got a nice job offer so I decided to spend my first couple paychecks on a nicer watch 4000 dollar range. 

I met my girlfriend and started dating her quickly around when I was 27. She’s a social worker so she’s making around 40k a year I’d say. I’m making around 130k. We decided to move in with each other and we rent an apartment together. We split the bills evenly for rent (place is not expensive) but I do generally pay for all our meals outside and do spend on random things like vacations for both of us since I do make more. 

Here’s our recent problem. I’ve wanted a watch that’s generally around the 12-15k range since I started working. When I mentioned it to my gf a couple months back she thought it was silly to spend so much. I ultimately decided to buy the watch two weeks ago. I was so happy when I got it so I wore it and kept it on for several days. We hung out at her friends place and had a bbq with ten people (we all wore masks and social distanced). A friend of hers noticed my watch and got super annoying and judgmental for me buying the watch (it’s a Rolex so everyone knows the name and think they are super expensive). They asked how much it was and my gf said it’s over 10k. A couple of her friends really seemed concerned that I just blew that much money on a watch. I made the mistake of blurting out that I have several more cheaper watches in the 5k range after one of her friends asked my gf why she’d allow me to spend so much. 

Once we got home, my gf started crying and screaming at me for embarrassing her at her friends place and asked my why I wore my watch there. I was confused. She said that everyone there makes around as much as her and obviously wearing such an expensive watch around them was tacky and snobbiness. I told her I disagree. I worked hard for where I’m at and this watch to me symbolizes the effort I put it. It’s personal for me. I don’t go around telling everyone about my watch.

Recently another store that sells the same items has come up for sale, but it lacks the good reputation and excellent location that my husband’s shop has. It’s smaller and ticked behind another business in a non-touristy area, while my husband’s current shop is in a tourist heavy pedestrian mall. 

He wants to buy the smaller shop (mainly because a friend is selling it) at the same time that he buys the shop that makes money. I’ve always heard that the worst thing a business can do is expand too quickly. There’s also the issue of staffing, which is already hard to come by where we live. They can barely keep one store staffed, I don’t think it’s going to be possible to staff two.

5859,Asshole," My mom is in her mid sixties while I’m in my late twenties. She and my dad didn’t have much growing up and when they had me and my sister, they spent what little they had to make sure we were taken care of. Even when things got better for us financially, she thought it was more sensible to save money for future needs than to splurge a bit and buy things for herself.

So now that I have a very stressful but well-paying job, I ‘spoil’ her by buying her things that I know she wants but never bought, such as fine jewelry. (She and my dad couldn’t even afford an engagement ring when they got together.) I have bought her several over the past few years; all of them are in the $3K-$7K range so they’re not the most expensive things, but my mom is always excited and happy to receive them. 

The last time I went home to visit her, my boyfriend came with me and was there when I gave my mom her third jewelry set. She was still excited and happy to receive it, but gently told me that going forward I should just save my money for my future family instead of buying her more jewelry. 

I assured her that I have separate budgets for my savings and for buying her jewelry. She said that she doesn’t want me to ‘waste’ more money on jewelry as the ones I bought for her are already enough, and it’s much more important save for the future. I answered that I don’t consider buying jewelry for her as wasting money since I know it makes her happy, and on the practical side, I’ll inherit the jewelry when she dies anyway. 

My mom laughed and said alright, and we went on with our day. But later that night when it was just me and my boyfriend, he told me that he was shocked that I would say something like that to my mom and that he doesn’t think I should say things like that again because it’s like telling my mother that I expect to ‘regain’ all the jewelry I gave to her when she dies. And that’s unfair because we don’t know what she might want to do with the jewelry, if she might want to give some to my sister or to my cousins. 

I told my boyfriend that knowing my mother, she would likely leave the jewelry to me and my sister, but if she also decides to give some to my cousins then I have no problem with that because they’re my sister and my cousins (who I am also very close to). I guess she could also donate all of them to charity if she wants, and I’d also have no problem with that. 

But realistically I just find it hard to believe that she would choose to leave the jewelry I gave her to people other than me and my sister. My mother’s whole life has been about working and saving money to make sure that she can provide the best life she can for us, I don’t see how or why that would change and she would decide to leave most of the thousands of dollars worth of jewelry I bought for her to other people. And that’s why I said that I’ll inherit the jewelry when she dies anyway.",44,39,0.76,AITA for telling my mom that I’m not ‘wasting’ money when I buy her jewelry because I’ll inherit it when she dies anyway?,csz0mx,2019-08-20 13:40:21,YTA,2900,AITA
7809,Not the A-hole,"This didn't happen today, but a few days ago.  
Because it might be relevant in some issues, I'll go ahead and say I'm from a country in Europe, so some details are different from what is usually posted here.  


What happened is pretty straightforward. Basically I came into an intersection where I had green light so I went straight through. Unfortunately, a cyclist who was coming from my left side ignored his red light and I ended up hitting him at \~50kmh full impact on his side. He was wearing a helmet but he didn't move with the impact and had to go in an ambulance to the hospital.  
The police arrived almost at the same time as the ambulance and I was cleared since several witnesses confirmed that it was the cyclist that ran over a red.  


Now, with the impact, the front of my car was pretty smashed in, the lights on the left side were completely shattered, and as luck would have it, one of those metal ""radiuses"" from the bike's wheel lodged itself between the grill and into the engine of my car. The total to fix it is around 1100€, and my insurance won't cover it. However they told me I could get the cyclist to pay for it, as the accident was his fault.  
This is quite a bit of money for me to spend on something that I had no blame in, but I feel kinda douchy making someone who's in a hospital bed to pay, so I wanted some opinions.

1122,Not the A-hole," For those of you that live in the city, you can probably understand how infuriating it is to drive at times. People who swerve suck, people that ""slow-start"" and prevent you from making the green-light suck, etc etc.  

But NOTHING infuriates me more on the road than people not using their turn signals. Not only does it show their incompetence and laziness as a driver, but it shows how absolutely scummy they are for not taking the extra half-second and finger stroke in order to signal those they're sharing the road with. Even if your signals are broken (which is rare), you're still obligated to use hand signals. Or at least in the city I live.  

Fast forward to last night where I got out of a bar with a friend, and his friend offered to drive us home. Initially I said ""thanks but I'm good"" since I was planning on getting an uber, but my friend insisted she take us since we live nearby so I agreed.  So as she's driving she's already doing some pretty gnarly moves like leaving the parking lot at 40mph and flooring it before the redlights hit. Lo and behold, she's also not using her turn signal.  

I tell her that she should probably use them but she states that she's never had an issue before, which makes no sense whatsoever (turn signals are NOT for you, but for people around you). I explain this but she gets annoyed and brushes it off.  Well we hit an intersection and she TURNS WHILE PASSING IT. This in itself is illegal but since she refused to use a signal, the driver behind her intended lane didn't stop and we almost got in an accident since she panicked, swerved back to the right and skidded along the sidewalk. 

I was in full adrenaline mode and as soon as the car stopped, I snapped and yelled out ""USE YOUR GODDAMN SIGNAL"", then left the vehicle and stormed off. I took an Uber the rest of the way home because I sure as hell wasn't going to apologize for my outburst.  

Well this morning my friend texts me saying that I was a dick last night for yelling at his friend like that even after she offered to take us home. I do feel bad but her refusal to signal, even taking into account the rest of her bad driving, almost got us hurt and I'm not ""grateful"" for that in the slightest.

12985,Not the A-hole,"Hey guys. 23/M here. Back in 2010, when I was in high school, I became interested in bitcoin and bought about $75 worth. Fast forward to today and... well it's worth quite a bit more. I've cashed out back in 2017 on most of it- about $12M worth after taxes. (I have about $2M still in bitcoin and plan on cashing out if the price spikes again).

I was in college when I decided to liquidate most of it. I felt on top of the world, but still wanted to graduate (I graduate this quarter), and on top of that, lead a fairly normal life. I've heard about how peoples' lives change because of the lottery, for example. Because of this, I have not told anyone about my investment gain. Not my mom, girlfriend, or any friends. I even keep a facade of being poor. I've grown up like that, and figured any big change in spending, etc. would raise some eyebrows. 

I met my girlfriend at the beginning of 2018, right after cashing out. We've been going out for over a year now. I plan on telling her whenever we move in together, but for now, she does not know.

Question is, AITA for this? I'm basically keeping a huge part of my life secret from everyone. On the other hand, I am not entirely stingy about my money.

10915,Not the A-hole,"About 5-6 months ago, I (18f) started having problems with my ears turning red and getting a lil warm. I scheduled an appointment with a dermatologist bc initially I thought it was allergies. Turns out it had to do with the cartilage in my ears rather than the skin. I was referred to a rheumatologist, for whom I had to go make another appointment for, but I couldn’t get in to see her for 3 weeks.

While I waited, my ears got worse. To the point where I can no longer leave my room anymore. I have to sit in my room all day, in the dark, in front of a fan, with ice packs strapped to my head because it’s that bad. The burning is excruciating and constant. I can numb it with ice packs, but only until they melt.

ALSO during this time, my sister (23f) began to experience lots of issues with cramps and pain in her abdomen. It turns out she has an ovarian cyst which is causing her pain whenever she has her period. I by no means discount that fact that she is in a lot of pain. She is very very vocal about how much it hurts. Here’s where I’m frustrated, however.

Once I finally get to the rheumatologist, she basically sits down and tells me that I have relapsing polychondritis. Which is a rare genetic autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the cartilage in the body. Since it’s so rare, they don’t know what triggers it, and treatment is mostly trial and error. They worry about long term because cartilage is everywhere in your body, including the heart and windpipe. If my body started to attack either of those, it could spell disaster. Basically, it could flare up in the wrong place at the wrong time and I could die at a young age because of it. The possibility of a flare up in my heart is a major concern, and I just learned all of this on Wednesday.

Meanwhile my sister is having issues with her cyst again, and is wailing and crying. For sure she is hurting, but also I just learned that I could die at any point. My parents have elected to skirt around that fact, and haven’t offered me a bit of comfort about it, instead focusing on my sister. I am forced (through pure necessity) to sit alone in my room all day long, every day, and have been for the last few weeks. I am extremely lonely. My parents make minimal effort to check on me. At most it’s a brief four sentence conversation and then they go right back upstairs to take care of my sister. Nobody comes to talk to me, nobody comes to see me, nobody sits with me.

Tonight I made it it upstairs to get some food, and I saw my mom in my sister’s room, lying on the bed with her, rubbing her back and comforting her. And seeing how much my mom was caring for my sister while also forgetting me made me feel jealous. I don’t doubt for a second that my sister is in a lot of pain. I’m just jealous that I’ve been forgotten about while I’ve learned that I could die young & that I have an autoimmune disorder that I’ll carry with me for the rest of my life.

16427,Not the A-hole,"Last month I turned 15, my parents said I have to get a job to pay board, my food, my clothes and to rent my laptop from my parents. I asked my Dad if I could work at one of the fast-food places he owns. He said no that would be called nepotism. I then filled out job applications online but didn’t hear back probably because nowhere wants to hire a kid (I’m not allowed to work more than 3 hours a day on a school night). Dad made me print resumes (he and mum said that's how they got their first jobs) and hand them to businesses but the places told me to submit online and they don’t take paper anymore. Mum and Dad both said I didn’t convince them hard enough.

The other day I got a job at a competing fast-food business and accepted (it’s only a 45min bus ride after school!). My parents then said I was deliberately disrespecting the family and their hard work by taking that job. I told them I got a job as they asked. Am I the arsehole?

Update.

Hi all. Thought I’d update you. Thanks for being nice to me. I felt really bad going to bed about what I did. So I decided to talk to my parents about it today. It kinda went good and bad. They didn’t yell or get angry but were like sad and disappointed which felt really like shit. Mum said I took that job to stick it to them which I did not gonna lie. So I can start regaining their trust, I’m gonna quit and look for something not in serving food. I still feel like and arsehole but having my parents not so upset with me makes that guilty feeling no so bad. Sorry for wasting your time I’ll try and reply more after lunch.

7163,Asshole,"Using a throwaway. There's a lot going on in this, but it mostly focuses on three women: my ex-wife, my current wife, and a female cousin. My ex and I have two children, neither of whom are biologically mine, which was discovered very recently and doesn't affect my love for them.

My wife is currently pregnant with our first child together. This started issues with my ex, who used it to basically reveal that our two children aren't biologically mine. Unfortunately, this means that a lot of her pregnancy has been dominated by legal issues with my ex. I've had to miss doctor's appointments to deal with going to court.

One of my cousins got pregnant around the same time. She's on her first marriage, and is having the first grandchild of both sets of parents, as well as her friend group. So naturally she is getting a TON of attention and pampering. Now, while this cousin is highly regarded NOW, this was not always the case and some of the favor is just the family trying to make up for the past. 

My cousin, while 36(?) weeks pregnant ended up in a car accident with her husband while out of state and ended up in the hospital needing major medical care. She has lost the baby. I don't actually know many details, but the accident wasn't their fault (drunk driver). Naturally, most of the women in our small family have gone off to help her.

My wife's baby shower is today and as of 8 am today, none of the women from my family will be attending. The two still in state aren't going out of ""being sensitive"" to [cousin]. To me this isn't a big deal as baby showers aren't a huge thing in my family. 

My wife blew up about this. She went on this whole rant about how nobody cares about her pregnancy, even though she was having my ""first"" child, how everything was about ex and cousin and she was always forced to but someone else first, no matter WHO they might be. 

Then there was a whole part about cousin and ex getting lavished with attention and whole showers while her baby was treated like a bastard. She then said that next we'd be asking her to surrogate for cousin because CLEARLY her worth was what she could do for everyone else. Which, no.

There's a LOT my wife doesn't know. I don't know if my cousin had a baby shower. That's not something men are typically involved in. My ex had showers because her family did them, and she technically had the first children, which biology or not, are my children.

My cousin was NOT always favoured. Some of this good treatment is to make up for her childhood. Also, this cousin had her child DIE. She's just having a reduced crowd. I'm sorry, but a baby shower doesn't outrank someone in the ICU. A healthy pregnancy doesn't outrank me losing my existing children. I told her all of this and now she's upstairs crying.

AITA?.

Mild update: 
Cousin is stable, and they hope to have her out of the ICU in a day or two and out of the hospital in ""a few weeks"". There will be a funeral for the baby after she is out. That's not usually done in my family but an exception because this must be her only child. Yes, this lines up almost perfectly with our child's due date, so they're going to hold the funeral sometime after. My wife has been asked to stay home for this.

E.g literal food waste not being moved. Black mold was also collecting in the top corners of the rooms. Obviously my mum didn't get the security deposit back.

For the past year, and the most recent months he has ballooned it weight. 300kg is my estimate as he refuses to go on scales.

19159,Not the A-hole,"I’ve known my best friend Brenda since we were kids. I was the first person she came out to as a lesbian when we were in our senior year of highschool and fully supported her. 

She met her current wife in college and they got married 6 years later. When I was 27, they both talked to me about wanting to start a family. They asked if I would consider being their sperm donor because they wanted someone they trusted rather than a stranger and who’d be there when their child started to have questions about their donor.

I was honored that they thought of me and agreed to do it. It felt good to help people I care about start their own family. We went through the whole process and a year later, Brenda gave birth to their daughter, Lucy (after Lucy Lawless of course, haha)

Since she was born, I’ve always been present in her life and we have a great uncle/niece type relationship. The 3 of us have been happy with how things are and they’re glad I’m close with Lucy. She’s already been told of how she came into the world (w/o the full details) and while she knows I “helped” build their family, I’m still Uncle Steven to her. 

3yrs after she was born, I began dating my girlfriend. I didn’t tell her about Lucy til 4 months in and it took her time to process this but she eventually came around.

We’ve been together 3 years now and planning on getting married. Last week was Lucy’s 6th b-day and we both were at their house. After cake was cut, we all started taking pics. I told my gf to come so we both could get one with Lucy but she said no. Didn’t think nothing of it until I noticed she was distant and hardly interacting with anyone.

We talked after we got home and she said she didn’t feel comfortable with me seeing Lucy anymore because it still felt weird that I donated sperm and now I’m playing a role in her life when donors don’t do that. This was a shock to me because she never brought it up before. When I said I wasn’t gonna stop, she got frustrated and it became a huge fight. She didn’t understand why I had to be in Lucy’s life and it felt unfair that she has to share me with someone who’s not my legal responsibility. 

At one point she asked if Brenda & I slept together and came up with this donor idea to cover the fact that I knocked her up, and that’s why I’m involved. I get we were both angry but asking that was out of line. I told her I’ll never cut off my relationship with them and left our apartment.
She’s still been trying to convince me for days and to also consider her feelings in all this.

Initially they had planned to make their wedding entirely no kids, but made an exception for our daughter as well as the daughter (1 year old) of the best man.

We were informed this weekend that the bride would like for me (as well as the wife of the best man and their daughter) to sit in the back row during the ceremony with my daughter so as to avoid any potential noise. My wife (who is included in the wedding party and will be standing up front during the ceremony) is pretty upset by this and feels that it is rude to ask direct members of the family to sit in the back. Personally I am not particularly offended, but I tend to side with my wife on this. Our plan would be to just have me sit with the rest of the family in the second row on the outside and be able to sneak away if our daughter happens to start stirring or making any noise.

The bride is concerned that this will 'ruin her moment' and is pretty insistent that I sit in the back. The groom is not bothered at all by where we sit but, understandably, is also deferring to his wife to be.

I am not one to ruffle feathers, but curious to see if my wife and I would be the assholes if we insist on sitting with the rest of the family?

Some additional context. The guest list is approximately 175 people, the wedding is taking place outdoors at a beach hotel very near to a pool with plenty of noise. The area where the wedding is taking place is right by the beach and generally the 'kids club' area, but they are removing all the slip-n-slides and toys and putting out chairs/decorations/etc.

3623,Not the A-hole,"This is happening today if it matters.

My wife works a 9-5 and I work at home. I'm also a SAHD technically because while I'm working, I contend with our children, 4F and 1F. My wife makes about 25% more than me per year because my work is contract based, not salaried, so some days I work, some days I just hang out with our kids. And when I do work, it's never a ""I need to be doing this at this time"", it's all around deadlines. So I can work while watching the kids at my own pace. It's a system that's odd but it works for us. I only mention all of this because I spend more time with the kids and almost never have time away from them for myself.

Three or four times a year, my wife uses her PTO to visit her parents with our children. They live about five hours away and I always make the drive. Sometimes I join them but it's usually I drive them, come home, then a few days later go pick them up. We live in a city but her parents are in more of a rural place. But they also live in a mansion compared to us. Tennis court, inhome theater, big inground swimming pool, parks aplenty around. It's really fun and therapeutic for my wife and children when they go because I'll admit it's very relaxing.

Yesterday I made that 10hr roundtrip and dropped them off, looking forward to 3 days of being alone. I'm caught up on work, gardening, house maintenance, so these next 3 days are purely for me to relax. I can play my violin which is rare because we have a 1 year old, play videogames, go see a movie. I have a little itinerary planned like I usually do. This is the time I can recharge.

But I got a text while I was asleep last night saying that our eldest 4F is not having fun/being a sourpuss/being a grumpygills that she has to stay there and wants to come home. My wife decides that they should all come home and honestly, I just want my free time. I don't want my kids to associate my parents in laws house with negativity but this is unfair to me to literally drive for 10 hours, sleep for 5 hours, then have to make another 10 hour drive. I told my wife to ""suck it up"" and she'll come around, she's just expressing immediate homesickness and will turn around. This has happened before, just not at this level. Our daughter is having tantrums, etc which is new but I still want to wait it out.

Obviously I haven't said yes or no, just suggested she wait it out but I want to know if I'm being the asshole before I make a final judgment. I'll probably relent but still upset that this is unfair because I haven't had free time alone in months.

We would swim in their pool, cook and play games. M has a little sister P(24f) and when we met we were both going thru a breakup and became the best of friends to avoid being lonely and make each other laugh. 

Eventually we would go camping with their extended family and I had a great relationship with all of them including their mom and dad. I didn’t really have a relationship with M because she was always with my brother. But the 4 of us me, P, M and my brother would hang out. 

Anyway - that was 5 years ago. My brother is pretty abusive(mentally) and manipulative to his girlfriends and M was no different. M’s parents didn’t like what they saw and how he treated her so naturally didn’t really like him. They broke up and I remained friends with P because we were inseparable. And eventually over the years M and I developed a friendship because when I would hangout with P at her house I’m not just going to ignore M.

It became a girls thing to hangout with P, M and their mom because she’s a fun mom. Over the years we became family and the mom would always introduce me to people as her third daughter to strangers. 


My brother hates me and thinks I betrayed him by remaining friends with P and becoming friends with M. 
Half of my family agree with him and the other half agree with me. Still 5 years later he still brings this up and hasn’t gotten over it. 


Well fast forward to my boyfriend who’s met M,P and the mom and really likes them is visiting from France next weekend. We are planning on a trip to the wineries with our my friends and family - he specifically invited the mom (M&P aren’t coming) My brother is mad at me and says that I’m betraying him and he’s not going if the mom is coming. (She is nothing but nice to him- apparently he says she’s told him mean things- I don’t see that from her but I don’t know) I told him that everyone is invited and that it was my boyfriend’s choice to invite her and if he doesn’t want to go he can decline. 

He says he’s not going but my other brother called me an asshole and says I don’t know how to respect boundaries.... 

I feel like we are all adults here....

12695,Not the A-hole,"This is my first post...ever so please be gentle

&#x200B;

First a little back story, my mom and dad divorced when I was 3 and got split custody.  For 6 weeks every summer I would spent time with my dad but the rest of the time I was with my mom.  As a kid it was great, but as I got older, I started to see things you don't really notice as a kid.  For example he was 45+ years old and still lived with his mom, he couldn't hold down a job, he was almost $18,000 behind with child support, he complains about everything I have and do even though he has nothing of his own.  One year I decided to slack off in high school so I could stay with my friends instead of going to see my dad, and I figured if I used summer school as an excuse I didn't have to hurt his feelings because it wasn't ""my fault"" I couldn't go.

&#x200B;

The same year I didn't go see him I also signed up for the Army and as soon as I did that my father legally disavowed me.  He still talks to me and I still try to make things work with him but it stings knowing what he did.  Over the years he has come to visit (always on my dime)  but every time he comes to where ever I am stationed he does nothing but complain.  I am in Hawaii at the moment and last time he was here he said the beaches were to dirty (from natural things like tree nuts and sticks) he never wanted to do anything and shot down every idea my wife and I came up with.  Its to the point now that even my daughters (6, 4 & 4) understand that you can't make papaw happy.

&#x200B;

Now the reason for the post,  someone he works with has a lot of airline miles and just gave my dad a free trip to Hawaii for Memorial day.  He called and told me this a few days ago saying when his plane lands that I will need to be there to pick him up, even though its in the middle of the work day.  When I told him I was working and there is no way I could get away  he told me he expected my wife to take my daughter out of school early and then go pick him up and that I could walk home from work to meet them at my house.  This was the last straw for me and I told him no and that if he shows up that I'm not coming to get him and he would have to find someone elses weekend to ruin.

I am a 23M with a long-term GF (23F). We have plans of getting a house in a different part of the country (where are better job offers) and getting married. However, my parents (70 and 71) really want me to stay with them. We have a big house where can two families live without any issues and they are pouring a lot of money and time into renovating it so I can stay living with them. They invested tens of thousands of dollars into renovating it, so they would make it livable for two families even though I have been saying for many years that I want to move out.

Every time I say it, they either ignore it or they say how dumb it would be to buy a house even though I already have one or they say how ungrateful son I am for not wanting to take care of them after everything they did for me (they paid for my university, bought me a car etc..). Sometimes they even say it's my GF's idea and that I would happily live with them if it wasn't for her.

Honestly, I love my parents and they did a lot for me, but I can't imagine living with them. We are just too different and we constantly argue about something. Sometimes it's really bad for my mental health, arguing so much. On the other hand, I know that they are old and they do need help.

18247,Not the A-hole,"About two weeks ago, I was kneed extremely hard in the testicles during a basketball game that left me writhing in pain for about 30 minutes. I went to an urgent care near our house and after several uncomfortable conversations with nurses and my doctor, they decided to refer me for a testicular ultrasound to see if there was any serious damage. 

I called to make an appointment at the ultrasound clinic the next day. I had trouble sleeping the night before so I was reading a little about the process. My wife is generally very cool and doesn't exhibit and negative jealous feelings, but when she heard that my appointment was with a technician named ""Amanda"", she suddenly suggested that she come to the appointment with me. I had no reason to decline so I agreed. 

We go to the clinic and get called into a room by a (thankfully) older woman who introduced herself as Amanda. My wife seemed visibly relieved at her age. On our way back to the room, Amanda indicated that their clinic was training new technicians and requested that a new tech shadow portions of my procedure. Of fucking course, the new tech looked like she was barely 20 years old and just stepped out of college. She said it would be her first time observing this specific procedure. My wife's eyeballs nearly popped out of her head and she asked ""Is it necessary to have two people present for the procedure?"" Amanda gave me a confused look and explained that the younger tech would be there just to observe.

The two techs leave after giving me instructions to undress. My wife stayed dead silent and stared at her phone while I tenderly placed my damaged goods under a towel and laid down. The techs come back in and start to walk me through the procedure. Amanda starts the process by pulling the towels back and exposing my testicles. She rubs some warm gel and starts moving the wand across. Out of the corner of my eye, I can see my wife staring daggers at the younger tech. She starts asking the young girl condescending questions about her experience level and age while I'm trying to hold down my dick that is giving the natural response to having warm gel rubbed on my balls. 

Suddenly, Amanda turns to the younger tech and asks if she would like to try. I literally thought my wife would launch herself over the chair. She asks how much longer until they are done and keeps fidgeting and making sounds. I am the most mortified I have ever been. I suddenly have a beautiful woman in her early 20's who is trying to navigate this wand across my testicles and I cannot control my reactions. I have an absolutely rock hard erection that my wife is clearly noticing and as she is berating the young girl, I turn to my wife and ask her to leave the room. 

We finish up the procedure and I walk outside to find that my wife has already left. I took an Uber home and didn't speak for a couple days. For the past week, we've been talking again but she hasn't brought it up.

They said no, they were just doing some “rearranging” and needed to get him out of the way for a couple days. I told them I noticed the poor thing didn’t have food or water and they said they would take care of it.

7477,Everyone Sucks,"My family runs a tour company that operates small to large tour groups around the surrounding region. These span from scenic tours, historic sites, and even some whale watching. 

In order to make things run more smoothly, and also to the benefit of our customers, some of these tours are group focused. For example, we have tours specifically for Chinese and Taiwanese tourists with bilingual guides. 

Along these lines, my mother started organising family tours a while ago specifically for parents with young kids. She is very family oriented and these tours are her pride and joy so to speak, being specifically geared towards making sure the kids enjoy themselves as well as their parents. It’s also a great opportunity for kids to make new friends.

Now, because these are a hobby of my mother and done for the benefit of new families, they are significantly cheaper than the main tours. 1 or 2 parents can simply buy a family pass for a set price and bring up to 3 kids at no extra cost. The family pass costs significantly less than two adult tickets for the equivalent normal tour group. For this reason, bringing at least one kid is mandatory, else people would take advantage of the price discrepancy. **We are very clear about this requirement.**

Fast forward to yesterday, a couple without any kids shows up to a family tour they had booked online. I immediately bring this up and they explain they’re “child free” and booked this one since the normal one was full. I explained that this is a family tour and we are very clear about this requirement, which sparked a ridiculous argument about them being discriminated against as a child free couple. The online booking system requires them to put in how many kids they have (1+) so they 100% knew they about this. They definitely lied to book the tour.

Eventually I relented and offered to let them join the tour provided they pay the difference between this and the normal one for two adult tickets. They refuse saying they already paid online and shouldn’t have to pay more than the advertised price. Again sparking a ridiculous argument about them being discriminated against. 

Eventually the tour is set to leave and they, accepting Im not gonna budge, demand at least a refund. I refuse since the tour was fully booked meaning their fraudulent online booking almost certainly meant we missed out on another family. 

They claim this is illegal, at which point I gave them the contact details of our family’s lawyer and said we would be happy to see them in small claims court. They swore at me before walking off defeated.

Since then our tour group has seen a bunch of fake reviews from a “child free” Facebook page claiming we’re evil etc. Luckily we got them removed since they’re obviously fake, but AITA for my response to them?

14368,Not the A-hole,"My mother died when i was 6 so my father raised us alone. He never got remarried but he would often pick up women from the bar and have sex with them when we were home. It was quite an experience to see my drunken father come home and have sex with random women in the living room when i was a kid. My father was an alcoholic and would beat me, my brother and my sister. My brother was 10 when i was 6 and my sister was 8. My father would beat us whenever he was drunk and sometimes he would just beat us for no reason other than he's having problems at work that he would take out on us. He worked at a bank, which i guess was stressful but it paid well so we lived fairly comfortably in the sense that we were always fed, clothed etc. My father was never there for me, never attended any of our sports or school events and never really was there when we needed it. He never even picked us up from school so we had to walk 3 miles there and back everyday. When i was 14 i got a girlfriend and i was hoping if i introduced him to her he would start to approve of me. He basically told me to get that hoe out of the house and never bring her back. He called me a pussy for not wanting to play football and for being in the band. His alcoholism and abuse got worse in our later years. He would begin to beat us daily and i was scared to go home everyday. I eventually grew a backbone and so did my brother and we fought back and actually beat him. My grandpa found out, and decided to use what little money he had and send all of us to a boarding school. My grandpa died a few years later, giving all of his money for us to send us to a boarding school. Im 24 now and my father died from a heart attack. Looking back, i really regretted not telling anyone about our abuse so i feel like i had to do it now. During the eulogy, most people went on about how he was a loving father, how he raised such wonderful children as a single parent, how he contributed greatly to the community and other bullshit. This really infuriated me and when it was my turn to speak i spoke about how much of an abusive father he was, an alcoholic and a womanizer. He was a selfish scumbag who cared for nothing other than himself. I took off my shirt and i showed everyone the scars he left me on my back from whipping us with his belt.

13271,No A-holes here,"I would like to start by saying that my family lives across the country, so anytime they come to visit they stay at least a week, but only visit about once a year. Anyways, whenever they come to visit, I’m always the one who has to give up my room because we have no guest bedroom. So, that always means that I must sleep on the couch and let them stay in my bedroom for however long they stay and my sister has not once ever had to be the one to give up her room. My parents never ask me if I’m okay with it and always give some excuse that I have the cleaner room or more comfortable bed and that’s why I must sleep in the couch. For as long as I can remember it’s always been like this when family visits and I feel as if I’m being punished simply because I keep my room cleaner than my sisters. Well, my graduation is in two weeks and my mother just informed me that I must let my grandparents stay in my room and I have to sleep on the couch. This seems incredibly unfair to me because not only is it one of the most important moments of my life and would like to get ready in my space and sleep in my own bed and not the couch, but also because my sister doesn’t even live at home and her room has been empty (and clean) for months now. She’s coming into town for my graduation (and her wedding, which is the day before my graduation) but could easily stay at her fiancé’s house, which is less than ten minutes away. I brought this point up to my mom and she did make a valid point that my sisters bed doesn’t have a bed frame and is lower to the ground than mine is, but not ridiculously low. She believes that it would be hard for my grandparents to get out of my sisters bed due to the height, however I don’t believe it would be.

Everyone was surprised but not as surprised as my sister in law who, in the beginning of the conversation, kept mentioning her organic shopping and how it can be pricey. She told me to try to shop only at Aldi’s for a month, organic only and see how I like it. I just brushed it off and kind of laughed saying nah, I’m okay I don’t really understand that kind of stuff.

During the confinement, my now ex-boyfriend was confined with a ""friend"" who turned out to be his women best friend with whom he had been cheating on me for months. My self esteem is not the best right now.

I have to go back to college pretty far away from my parents in September, and they spent yesterday helping me look for an apartment.

&#x200B;

Last night, while I was eating with my parents, I started complaining that my blonde hair was a little orange, as a friend told me that the afternoon and i wanted their opinion, i also say that i wasn't pretty enough and that was why my boyfriend cheated on me. I know, it's ridiculous, but I wanted someone to cheer me up and tell me I was pretty. My dad laughed and told me that the reason I didn't have a boyfriend wasn't because I wasn't pretty, but because I was boring. He went on for the rest of the meal (about ten minutes) saying that I'm a pain in the ass, that I always have to break the mood wherever I go because I know everything better than everyone else, using an example from a party where I made a remark to a boy who made a series of sexist and racist jokes and nobody wants me because of that. My mother said that I was too hard on people, that I didn't accept differences of opinion. It's true that I come from a very rural background, where racist and misogynistic jokes are legion, that this is really something I can't stand.

I ended up leaving the table crying. I heard my parents continuing the conversation. My father said that my boyfriend probably leave me because he was so annoyed with my behaviour, that I should have done everything I could to keep him, but that I still had to be a pain in the ass and that I would never find a guy by being a dork. Then he added that i'm a bitch.

Anyway, I was crying in my room, and my mom came over. She wanted to show me some flat she'd seen for me, and I told her crying that I wasn't in the mood, and I didn't want to talk. She said that all they thought with my father was that if I didn't have a boyfriend it was because I ask too much of people, I'm too hard on them in my judgments, that I should let it go.  I said that they were completely toxic to insult me. My mother left.

8144,Not the A-hole,"So to give a little bit of background my AC stopped working on a Sunday. I called a local business that had good reviews (several hundred reviews). They said it would be extra to come out on the weekend so I asked if they could come out on Monday. I figured I could suck it up for a day. They make the appointment and tell me it will be $40 for them to come out. 

The next day rolls around and I leave work a bit early to be home for the 4:00 service call. I wait and wait, but it gets to be 5:00 and no one is there. I call them and ask where the repair person is. Apparently I was never put into the system. They apologize and agree to get someone out ASAP that day. They tell me it’s going to be $75 for the service call. I explain that I was told $40 on Sunday. She says that they did have a discount but you had to mention when you called. She eventually agrees to go with the price I was originally told and was very nice about it saying, “if you were told $40 that’s what we’ll charge.”

The repair guy shows up and he fiddled around for about 10 minutes and then comes and says to me that he’s done all he can for $40 and if I want anything else done it’s a $150 diagnostic charge. Well I’m stuck in a 89 degree house and it’s too late to call anyone else so I say “sure whatever”. He spends a few more minutes and discovers a loose wire. He fixes the loose wire in about 5-10 minutes comes down out of my attic and tells me it will be $300 total. So to recap it was $40 for the service call, $150 for the diagnosis, and $110 for him to strip and reattach a wire. I was never told about the $150 diagnostic charge when I called them to come out. Well I pay because I’m burning up and he’s not the guy to take this up with anyway. I leave a one star review on their business explaining all of this. Well a week later their business replies saying they’re reversing my charge and giving a full refund. I didn’t necessarily want a full refund. I would have been happy paying about 180-200 for the work. I know I’m paying for his expertise not the speed  or ease of the repair. I just felt it was predatory that I wasn’t told upfront about the $159 diagnostic charge.  I feel kind of bad keeping the refund but they gave it to me and my dad says I should just keep it. 

So AITA leaving my review up and just keeping the full refund? I’m going to go and reply to them thanking them for it and explain that I wish they had been upfront about all potential charges, but I’m not going to change my review because other people should know and people usually check the one star section. 

tl;dr repair company was shady with their charges and did not tell me about a $150 charge before coming out. I left a bad review on google and they gave me a full refund.

It’s not that I can’t cook, I just don’t particularly love cooking. In fact, whilst single, I basically ate the same thing every day. For example, dinner was just skinless chicken breast, brown rice (or potatoes) and a salad (no dressing, because I didn’t think it needed it). I have my routine and can autopilot that stuff particularly when I’m tired from work.

Thing is, yes, I have tried to cook something she requested, I honestly didn’t find the taste gains were worth the extra effort and the extra clean up. My partner ended up saying she’d stop cooking the meals I like from her until I get better at cooking, but I’m happy enough with what I cook for myself.

In the end I’m saying to her if you don’t like my “bland”, “flavourless”, “repetitious” food you don’t have to eat it. I’m not locking down the kitchen here, it’s open and you’re free to cook for yourself. I’m just not trying to look for another solution to a problem I solved yonks ago.

Every time Kacy gives in to hang out with him, he's always tried to come over after, the last time this happened Kacey ended up locking her door and leaving him in the living room after constantly telling him he can sleep on the couch. 

A few days ago it was Tina's birthday. So Both my roommates and I, along with a few of our friends, including Jack, went to go out and drink and celebrate. So we had fun and moved on to some karaoke to continue the night. Now, at this point, both Tina, and Kacey are pretty wasted, I was a a little past tipsy but not too drunk. Now I know Jack wasn't drunk at all, he arrived about 2 hours after we started drinking and was mostly there for the karaoke.  So, the night is winding down, and I call us an Uber. Before we leave, I overhear Jack talking to Kacey that he's going to come over later, I ignore it and hop in the uber and head home with my roommates. So back at home I asked her if Jack was coming over and she said she doesn't know and she asked if I could tell him not to.

However, nobody is perfect, including myself. My gripe comes with her attachment to instagram. Normally, a husband being upset his wife is spending too much time on social media would be clearcut: he's not the asshole. But let me explain more.

We both love fitness. I was a personal trainer before we met. Last year, she converted her account into a fitness instagram. She's been very successful. It's a compilation of videos,  posts, and more. It's not a provocative account like those girls who post ass pics. It has substance. I should also note she works a full-time job. Normally, I despise influencers and the whole culture because, by definition, it's a self-absorbed activity.

I get upset because this consumes her. We finish our days, and she'll basically sit on the couch on her phone either posting, answering questions, or putting all of her workout stuff on her Insta stories. It takes time and if i ask something like ""babe can you set the table while i cook?"" she says ""yea"" but does nothing because she is absentminded. I end up doing it all. If we are watching a show, she just stays on her phone. Couple this with the fact she always wants me to take pictures and I get pretty upset. If anyone has seen that Instagram Husband video, that's a hilarious parody.

At this very moment she is standing in the kitchen on her phone when she told me she'd cook. It's been 25 minutes and I hear nothing. She is standing there on the phone.

I've tried setting boundaries.  I've said it gets in the way of our relationship. Sometimes she'll lash out say she's trying to build a blog and that I should be a supportive. Other times, she agrees and puts it away. There is no black/white here.

Last week it turned into a fight. The usual cycle happened. She came home. I cooked dinner while she was glued to the phone. She was on it during dinner, with basic  convo. She was on the phone while we watched the sopranos. It was when we went to bed and she sat on her phone for another hour that i lost it. I became apoplectic an it turned into a huge ordeal. I called her selfish. She countered that there will be times in marriage where I will have to devote large amounts of time to something, and that the other partner should be supportive. This makes sense because I will be starting work at a law firm soon, so I too hope she will be understanding at that time. Still, I am furious because the whole thing is frustrating and I can't tell if I'm being selfish or not.

13742,Not the A-hole,"This happened a few years ago, but I still think about it.

I used to teach 8th grade.  I had one kid, call him Billy.  He was incredibly smart.  But he also just was a pain in the ass to be his teacher.  The kind of kid that people who never even taught him knew his reputation and who he was.   He wasn't a ""bad"" kid, but he definitely was a smart ass who purposely broke the rules whenever he wanted.   It was all for attention, because honestly, if he just came to my room to hang out before or after school, he was actually nice.

We had this ""behavior contract"" students and their parents had to sign at the beginning of the year.  Essentially after a certain number of detentions or suspensions, we started taking away 8th grade activities.   So the first thing was the DC trip, then it was the 8th grade awards luncheon, and finally it was graduation.  I had never had a kid actually get to the point where graduation was off the table, until Billy.  And this wasn't just detentions I gave, it was anyone.  So while I was his homeroom teacher, he had plenty of other teachers he interacted with, and their punishments counted as well.  He knew early on he wasn't going to DC.  And not long after that, he lost the awards luncheon.  However, he knew he was getting close to not being able to walk for graduation.  And he was fairly good for a while.  But it didn't last.  As it turned out, the detention I gave him, was the one to put him over the edge.   Since it never happened before, the principal actually gave me the final call on whether to take away this privilege (I was very upset as I think it should have been his call and he shouldn't have put it on me).  A lot of people I talked to, including my mom, said how graduation is really for the family, and taking that away would suck for them.  In the end though, I said no, he was difficult all year to all of his teacher, so he will suffer the consequences.  And I didn't let him walk.  I'm still not sure whether this was the right call

19279,Not the A-hole,"So, backstory. My fiancé and I have been together 2.5 years. My fiancé’s brother, and his fiancée have been together a year and a half on their wedding day. My fiancé and I started planning our wedding before he formally proposed, and he spent 9 months planning his proposal (started planning before his brother even started dating his now fiancé). This is also not the brothers first wedding. 

The problems started before my FH proposed. His brother decided a week before FH proposed, that he needed to propose the day after my FH proposed (he proposed on my birthday, family had known his plans for months), for no given reason. He tried to get my FH to move his proposal, so it “didn’t overshadow” his. My FH refused, so we ended up engaged days apart, which is whatever. 

We have our date and venue decided on before we were officially engaged and booked it immediately. FBIL was PISSED, because after we had already booked they decided they wanted to look at the same place. After they looked at it, (we didn’t care if they booked the same place), he got mad that our venue is double the whole budget they were given by her parents (they’re paying $0 for their wedding, we’re paying 90% of ours). They told people they had to pick a different venue because we “stole” their first pick. 

They set their date for exactly a month before ours. I was super petty about this, because why? You have a whole year, and HAVE to do it within the same 4 weeks? I’d understand if the date held meaning for them, but it doesn’t. It seems like it’ll put a huge tole on family and friends having to travel since they’re so close together, and ours is a little bit further for local people than theirs, so it made us concerned about if family would choose theirs over ours. 

Recently her parents backed out of paying for a caterer for their wedding, so they went to my future in laws to try to get them to MAKE us cancel ours because “it’s not fair” that we’ll have a full sit down, catered meal, and they won’t have food at all. 

They’re still asking us to downsize our wedding because ours shouldn’t be nicer than theirs. 

My FH and I refuse to change our day in any way. We’ve both spent over a year working over time and saving so that we could afford the wedding we want. Just with the deposits we’ve spent well over their total budget for their whole wedding. If we were to downsize (which we already have, by cutting 100+ guests due to the virus. Originally we were inviting 275, now down to 150ish, possibly having to cut more out), we would lose whatever deposits we’d already put down for whatever we’d be cutting.

I of course understand why it would bother her. And im sorry it happened to her. It was wrong of the bus driver to do that, full stop. However, during this conversation I said ""now you know how I felt the other day,"" in reference to when she had done the same to me.

He's now messaged me individually saying he's bought the item so can I transfer him my share. Again which I'm happy to do, but I'm thinking of asking for a screenshot of the receipt first. Would this be an asshole request?

Just as a bit of a background, this guy has a bit of a ""wheeler dealer"" history. I'm not questioning so much whether he has the gift, more his method of gaining it and/or how much he paid for it.

UPDATE EDIT: So as was the consensus on the post, I casually asked him for the receipt alongside his bank details. He asked me why I needed it and I just said it's for my own budgeting records. Low and behold, it turns out he hadn't actually bought it but was ""planning on buying it once everyone had chipped in"" which contradicts his original request but ok. He then calls me saying he's having second thoughts about the gift as everyone's being long about getting the money together and saying it's too expensive. So we just say fine forget about it...

All of it sounds very shady to me, and I suspect he already had the gift (maybe was a gift he received himself), that he was planning on re-gifting and possibly profiting off. None of this is surprising from him, but it's still disappointing that my suspicions look to be justified.

15071,No A-holes here,"Let me start this by saying I love my wife whatsoever and other than this, we have no issues whatsoever.

My wife frequently gets home later than I do, simply because I start work before she does. However over the past year there have been many times where she won't come home until well past dinner time, and usually won't let me know that she'll be late until well after I would expect her to come home.

I started asking her several months ago to tell me in the morning what time I could expect her home, and that if she would be late then all she has to do is let me know at some point during the day that she would be late. This hasn't worked out very well, though. She is pretty bad at estimating when she will be able to leave work - often times she will text me saying that she will be able to leave in 15 minutes, but then not leave for another hour. Sometimes it's because she is working on a project that has to be completed that day, but oftentimes it's because a co-worker or student comes to her office to talk to her (about work related things).

She has responded to this by instead not giving me an estimate for when she'll be home, since she's so bad at doing so (even she admits this). But I would much prefer that she just ... give me an estimate, and stick to it. She has told me that it seems controlling of me to do this, but honestly I just want to be able to plan my day and not knowing when she will be home makes it very difficult to do so - and my argument is that she is not respecting my time. On top of this, we will often be late for engagements because of this behavior.

So my friend group hangs out a lot and in order to save gas/time/money, we end up carpooling a lot. Today my friend, Carly, wanted to take her younger sister, Annie, to see animals at a farm. This seemed like a spur of the moment thing since they called me to tell me to get ready about 10 minutes before they showed up at my apartment. My friend, Stan, was already in the front passenger seat and Carly was driving with her younger sister Annie in the backseat, so I got in the seat across from her.

&#x200B;

We end up at the farm, but we don't stay long due to the lack of animals and just things to do in general. Afterwards, we hang out some more at a park and we get food. Along the way, we end up picking up another friend, John, but we all decide to go home. Stan, John, and I all live relatively close so Carly was going to drop us off at home in the order of me, Stan, and John. 

&#x200B;

She pulls into my apartment complex and stops a few feet before my building. I ask her to pull up closer so I wouldn't have to walk as far and she would have to move up anyways in order to turn around and leave. She refuses. So I put my foot down and refuse to get out because she was being difficult. This stalemate lasts a few minutes before Carly decides to leave... with me still in the car. She ultimately decided that I ""had my chance"" and that she was going to drop off Stan and John then she was going to go home. She said that I could get out at one of their houses and find a way home from there. But due to unrelated reasons, I wouldn't be able to get home if I did, so I stayed in the car and watched them leave one by one until it's just me Carly and Annie left in the car.

My husband and I married 2 years ago, I have been divorced from X as of 5 years ago. We married at 20 and it just never was really going to work. Honestly surprised we made it 10 years.

We are not poor, but we do not spend frivolously. We have enough money for the life we live and that’s about it. No expensive vacations or anything like that. Now, X I guess came into a lot of money shortly after we divorced. He got a new job or something idk, we don’t talk. X takes our son for 2 weekends a month, and he ALWAYS comes back with something. Videogames and gaming accessories, shoes, sports equipment, clothes, shit even expensive colognes and a chain once. 

My husband and I cannot afford to spend on the kids like this, and the kids understand. They have what they need but ultimately they have to wait til Christmas or birthday if they want something like that. I’ve been seeing tension among the kids, my husbands kids have been getting upset about the constant gifts my son gets from X. My husband thinks it’s a little ridiculous too, like X is just trying to show off, but he’s not going to tell X what he can and can’t get for his own son. 

Since all the sheltering, my son hasn’t seen his father. But last week we got a prime package with X’s name on it. It was a gift for our son. Some game he wanted idk. Before giving it to our son, I decided this was going to stop. I called X and explained that it’s totally unfair to the other kids when they see him with all new things. And that if he wants to buy our son things they have to stay at his place. 

X roared at me “Just because your new husband can’t afford what I can for his own kids, I can’t give my son gifts? I worked hard for my money I can spoil my son if I want to, I don’t have to worry about your step kids feelings. I don’t have to buy my son less because you got remarried”

She didn’t like her apartment and didn’t enjoy living alone. The conversation was had to live together. I went back and forth for awhile because I really liked my current space, but to further sell me on the idea of living together we looked at a place that was would save me a lot of money. I agreed, we put a deposit down.

I had (have) a boyfriend and she had a long-er term BF who was still in school in a different city but was expected to graduate soon. After we committed to living together, she asked if it would be OK if her boyfriend lived with us.... with his puppy German Shepherd. I said I wasnt comfortable with that, bc it’s kinda weird living as a third wheel and we both each had a cat- itd be too much. I love dogs, but my cat hates dogs and I didn’t want to live with a puppy which I had no control over.

Long story short, we ended up finding a house for rent instead of the apt.  I agreed to pay a greater portion of the rent (which ended up costing the same as my old apt) to have the master suite. She got her own bedroom and bathroom, just wasn’t a suite. We used my furniture to furnish all communal living spaces.

Doing the math, she would only owe 65$ more on the year, bc he would be paying a portion for those two months which *should* also alleviate her financially. She FREAKS OUT. 

It comes out she was planning on paying for whatever portion he would owe, because he doesn’t have a job. Their relationship was never very stable, and she blamed that on me. I got called some nasty names, got rumors spread about me at our work place, and endured her pettiness at home every day until she moved out.

I am definitely willing to have mocktails and dealcoholized wine but by fiancé says that it won't suffice.

There is another reason I don't want alcohol. My family has a negative view of my finance, and having alcohol at the wedding would only make it worse, as my parents are strict teetotallers and view alcohol as a very big evil.

We made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. We got the car, a 2012 Honda Civic.

Wife and I up and sold the car. We didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. It's so unfair, I didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am I supposed to get to work, what about when I go to college? Well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk.

6760,Everyone Sucks,"Some background here, I am a rather tall girl among my classmates. The sports I train on also makes me a little bit bulky and my skin a little darker and rougher. I have short hair and often dress tomboyishly(is that a word?), also occasionally apply makeups to make my features more masculine to the point of getting mistaken as a guy by strangers sometimes. It is nothing complicated really, I just find myself looking better this way as I look awkwardly like a drag queen if I dress like a girl.


While my whole class knows about me, there is one particular girl who(serious or joking) always assume that I am either a lesbian or a FTM in the making. She spoke as if it's already fact and decided without considering my opinion. When I confront her about this, her reply was ""But (my name), you play rough sports, you dress like a boy, you hang out with boys!"" And suggest me to sort out my own identity myself, which I rolled my eyes and just left her be, we were not close enough to be discussing my identity anyway. 


There's recently a new guy who joined the class, a rather handsome one, I must say. We were introducing ourselves to him one by one as he walked around. When it was my turn, right after I told him my name, the girl called out :""Don't get your hopes up, she's a gay!"" And the whole class laughed.


I may be laughing along but in fact I was quite irritated. So I walked up to her, announced: ""Yups, and meet (her name), my girlfriend."" And gave her a  quick peck on the lips. She could not break free before the contact because I am much stronger than her, you know. The class then laughed again with cheers and claps and the new guy joined them. That girl though, after the initial shock, ran out of the classroom.


I heard later from the other girls that she developed a love on first sight with the new guy, and I completely ruined the first impression. According to them she had been crying in the toilet for hours(not true, she came back when the class starts but I get that exaggeration) My own friends were saying that I went overboard, and I feel a little sorry for that. Buuuut, it was not that she didn't ruin my first impression with the new guy too, even though he was not my type, and she had been assuming my identity for a while before that. 


TLDR: Girl keep assuming I am lesbian, told the new guy in class, and I kissed her in return. Turns out the new guy is her crush. AITA",53,82,0.84,AITA For Embarassing A Girl In Front Of Her Crush,cng8ra,2019-08-08 03:52:23,ESH,2420,AITA

No matter how much I try to reassure her, she doesn’t care for my opinion. As she’s told me, her opinion of herself is what matters.

But I noticed that she’s very happy when she looks “thin” from certain angles or clothing, and thinks more fondly of the memory. So slowly, I started photoshopping all of her photos to make her look thinner. As a result, she’s not as distracted during our vacations or worries about how she’ll look when we take photos. 

AITA here for doing this without telling her? Should I tell her at this point or would it just make things worse?

Immediately he tried to impose his own way of teaching and grading on us (the students) which was very different that anything we had ever experienced. You were expected to do things his way, and even if his was was wrong, which people pointed out to him, you were still expected to use it. R also took points off for scratch work that he didn't like, and tried to take off as many points as possible on the tests, quizzes, and homeworks. Every student he had with no exception was subjuct to this.

R also took forever to grade our assignments. We took a test the week before spring break, and got it back ~6 weeks later. He also refused to go over it with anyone. R never offered help outside of the classroom and was hostile whenever asked for extra help.

The administration took notice and we were informed that R was not coming back next year. Needless to say, we were overjoyed about this. Since the announcement, R completely checked out, he just wrote notes on the board, barely talked during class,and went to Disneyland instead of going to one of the review days for exams.

So anyways when I got my drivers license when I was 16, my parents bought me a 2008 Honda Accord which is a pretty nice car in my opinion and I was really grateful. Fast forward to when my brother got his driver's license, my parents didn't have the time to look for a car for my brother so he ended up driving my car when I wasn't using it. After about a couple of months of him driving my car, he ended up crashing my car into a tree because he wasn't paying attention to the road. Since the accident wasn't my fault, my parents offered to buy me a new car which I was very grateful for again because I spent majority of my savings on my first year of college and I'm still saving up for a new one. Anyways, they ended up buying me a car that many people would call a beater. It's a 1998 Toyota Corolla and honestly driving that car scares me but I sucked it up and didn't complain because I didn't wanna sound ungrateful and I appreciate them for buying the car for me. Well today, my parents told me that they found a car for my brother. It's the same car I had before but with better mileage and it looks newer. I asked them if he could take the beater and if I could take the new car instead because he was the one who crashed my car so I should get the better car. They said I had to talk to my brother and it was up to my brother if he wanted to drive the beater and obviously he said no. Now they're saying the car is gonna be for him and I'm honestly pissed about it but I feel like I shouldn't be because it's not even my money that I'm spending on the car.

I volunteer to run D&D at a local business, and as the game master (GM), I essentially get the final say on rules, lore, and how situations play out. My job is to make try to make the game fun for everyone, myself included, and to lay out the adventure for the players. Recently one of the players, Cory, has been a little difficult to deal with, often taking the fun out of it for other players and me. He constantly argues with other players and me, gets into a foul mood when things don't go his way, cheats when his dice don't roll his way, and doesn't let others do what they want to do in game (often cutting them off).

**Incident:**

It all came to a head today after a joke didn't land well with Cory (he tried to use real-world mythology to justify an in-game action, I told him the game world doesn't work that way, he does it anyway insisting it should work, and I later present a situation where his action clearly did not work). The table enjoyed the callback, but Cory gave me the finger with the full intent of saying 'fuck you.' After several incidents, I just don't want to deal with Cory at my table anymore.

After I got home and vented my frustrations to a friend, I found out that Cory has Asperger syndrome (something Cory freely shared with my friend yesterday but never told me me). While I can empathize with the level of difficulty this can add to social situations (and I could have given him a little more patience than I normally would if I had known), I still don't think Cory should get carte blanche to pull everyone down with a crappy attitude, argue, cheat, or dictate what other players do. I'm ready to email the business owner/event organizer to let them know that I don't want Cory at my table because it's not fun for me or the other players (this would not prevent Cory from participating at other tables unless other GMs did the same).

18984,Not the A-hole,"Settle in, this'll be a long one...

New 1st time dad here to a healthy little princess born this past Thursday. Unfortunately, the joy my wife & I felt in this scenario was temporarily halted by my mother's wholly inappropriate behavior that I'm just not ok with.

Some background: my mom has always been one of those people with a massive victim complex. People she knows go out to dinner & don't invite her? Must have been intentional. A decision is made without getting her input? Must have been done on purpose to spite her. You get the idea. 

This behavior manifested heavily 5 years ago when we got married and became a sore point for a long time. Once she found out we were expecting, again the negative behaviors came out. 

Tired of her leaving a stain on every moment that should be joyous, I finally had a sitdown with her. I told her in no uncertain terms that I wasn't going to raise my daughter in a negative environment like this, that we want her to be around and involved but her attitude needs to change. I was polite but firm about all of this. She resisted at first, resorting to her usual ways & thinking I was just plotting to get away from her completely, but in the end she claimed to have understood where I was coming from and promised to try and change her tone.

Well, the big day arrives and everyone is at the hospital. Baby is born, we had some bonding time as a family, then invited the grandparents (both sides) up to meet her. On arrival we introduced her and shared her name (we'd elected to keep it a secret). My wife and I come from different religious backgrounds and thus different naming traditions. Mine is to name after a departed loved one, hers is to name after a living relative. So our compromise was to name her after my grandmother (mom's mom) who passed a while ago and make the middle name for her mom, our daughter's grand mother.

After being in the room a bit and meeting her the question inevitably comes up of how we came up with her name. So I explain and at first she's beaming that her granddaughter is named for her mother, then when we get to the middle name her face changes to a look of pure anger and she says YOU DID WHAT?!? I calmly explain again, only to get OK, folded arms and a pouting demeanor clearly displaying her disapproval at this choice. This is supposed to be a happy occasion and I finally decided enough was enough and told her it was time to go. This lead to resistance from my dad, her going off the rails again about how everything is against her, and my wife hysterical that another even has been messed up. So I told my dad flat out that this behavior is the reason why and I won't have my kid around it, that when she's ready to behave like the grandmother we want our daughter around she can return but for today we're through. Apparently according to any and all in my family I'm the asshole for stepping in this way.

4462,Everyone Sucks,"I'm not a child psychologist or anything and I come from a very competitive family. My dad had no mercy when it came to Monopoly, chess, and especially bowling. In fact, we still have an annual tournament when we're all together with a trophy and everything -- one which I've never won in the last 25 years or so.

I've grown to be a mom who let's my 6-year-old win at all the games. I think it's a confidence builder and will encourage him to play again and again until he wins on his own (he can get to ""check"" in chess now on his own, but I need to be pretty negligent to get him to checkmate). 

My husband, however, is ruthless. He will fire a football so far and fast that our little guy is basically playing fetch. He even plays Don't Break the Ice like it's a world championship. Fun trivia questions at dinner have turned into The Chase and Husband is The Beast (Google ""The Chase UK"" if you don't know).

We both grew up in opposite households where I was pushed by my parents in any and all competitions and he needed to be self-sufficient by 11. Husband thinks pushing his small child now will be character-building, while I think he's only 6! Throw him a bone! Stop being such a butthead. In fact, I think his competitiveness has put me in the other extreme, where I now applaud the most inane achievements -- ""Oh my goodness, little Billy! You moved a checker piece! AMAZING!""

So, AITA and setting my impressionable child up for great disappointment in the future, or my husband, who will decapitate someone with a football before conceding defeat?

INFO: our child doesn't doesn't ALWAYS win, as explained in the original post, he loses quite often to his dad. I think a lot of people are assuming I'm the main caretaker, hence why he would throw tantrums if he always won. However, my husband is a stay-at-home dad and I'm the working parent. Therefore, our son is 75% more likely to lose a game than win. However, I wrote somewhere below that out son is a very graceful loser and was stoked about archery despite being awful at it.

Also, my husband is not mean or nasty. They have other hobbies they share, building skills outside of competitions, because our lives are much bigger than a Reddit post. This is a snapshot of a single issue.

My son isn’t biologically my son. His father died when he was very young (6ish) and his mother was unfit to raise him. My husband and I took him in and have been with him ever since. He was generally an excellent child. He’s given us endless joy and happiness. Recently though, he’s started to act out. At first it was small. Breaking curfew, lying, hanging out with questionables. We tried talking, because he is a straight A, chess club, football, beta club all around good kid. 

It didn’t work. We tried grounding. Screaming. Listening. You name it we’ve tried it. His misbehavior is only escalating though. He was caught smoking weed. (I know weed isn’t huge and I’ve always been open about that conversation but clear that he was expected to stay away until he was 18 an adult to make that decision.) He was involved in a hit and run. He was caught stealing. 

This catches us up to our story now. In the middle of the night I get a call from the police, again. This time, our son was caught tagging an abandoned house and had taken my husband’s revolver from the safe. 

He was charged for the gun and released to us. The officers were really great to us but I wish they wouldn’t have been so cool in front of son. 

I was livid and screamed at him, took away all of his privileges, anything I could think of and he still is treating it as a joke. He told my SIL that he thought it was all funny. 

I’m really confused and hurt, son and I used to be so close. The three of us all have always been very close. Husband and I feel as if our trust has been completely destroyed and that we’re losing our son.

5253,Not the A-hole,"Together 2 yrs. He went bald in his teens, completely bald by age 19 or 20. No medical condition, just very early onset male pattern baldness. I am hugely sympathetic – your hair is a big part of how you look, and I can’t imagine how hard that’d be as a teen. Not diminishing the importance or what a big deal that is to guys, especially so young. I get it. 

He is going to interview for medical residency soon and all he can talk about is how no one is going to hire him because he’s bald. He’s 6’2”, slim and athletic (swimmer/runner body), Caucasian, very handsome and symmetrical face, perfect teeth. Some people don’t like the bald look, but everything else is conventionally perfect. And he’s very sociable, intelligent, great with kids (looking for pediatric-related residency, so that’s relevant), has good grades, etc.

He goes on and on about how being bald is going to hold him back, nobody’s going to hire him, he should’ve gone to school for a job where you don’t interact with the public so employers might still hire him and just keep him in the background where nobody has to see him. In short, he’s being ridiculous, but he actually says this stuff very seriously, every single day.

I, on the other hand, am a very petite (4’11”, 95 lb), very young-looking (I was carded for an R-rated movie last year), dark-skinned black woman, also a doctor.  I started a little younger than he did, so I’m almost done with my surgery-related residency. It’s a constant struggle for me to be taken seriously as a surgeon. I am ALWAYS confused for a secretary or medical assistant (at best, a nurse) even when I’m in my surgical scrubs. This includes patients, staff, and other doctors. Patients don’t trust my advice, staff don’t take my instructions as seriously, colleagues aren’t always welcoming. That’s its own story, suffices to say I have a hard time and probably always will.

I just deal with it (what choice do I have?) but it’s really bothering me lately how much my SO whines about being bald when he otherwise has THE most stereotypical “doctor look” ever.

The problem is, I always pay with cash (their minimum is $10 so I feel like I'd be pushing it if I used my card), and for some reason they rarely have change.  A few time the waiter / cashier has pulled thirty cents out of his pocket so I could have my change - I think it's a family business so I haven't felt bad about that.  Other times I've told them to keep the change, even though I always call ahead for pickup and eat it at my work desk, so there's no real reason for me to tip.  This time the guy fumbled in his pocket for change and upon realizing he didn't have any, gave me one of my dollars back.  I had not insisted on getting change back - he offered it - but I did take the dollar.  Now I feel kinda bad.  It's not like if that sub was seventy cents more, I'd stop ordering it.

Since we work in a small warehouse, much of the cleaning duty falls on them. 
Nobody minds it. The only complaint that I get is that about eco friendly products. 
 
We rotate chores so nobody gets stuck doing what they hate. This system has worked out the entire three years we have been open. 

My last hire hates doing any of the cleaning. She has a pattern that I’ve noticed. Any day that requires her to clean bathrooms/take out trash she makes sure to talk about how anxious she is and how her stomach hurts, and she can’t focus. She often ends up laying down or going into a dark room to relax. 

At first I did the stuff for her because I felt bad, but after I noticed what she was doing, I told her she had to trade with one of her coworkers. She usually got someone to do the cleaning for her.

Friday was her day to do the trash and sort out recycling. When I went to go tell her to do it she was already sitting in the dark in our break room. I asked her to go take care of the trash, she said she couldn’t because she was on the verge of a panic attack. I asked her if she asked another coworker to do it, she said none of them agreed to do it. 

I told her that she could take a minute to calm down but she needed to get it done. She said  that there was no way she could do it. I told her to go ahead and clock out then. She asked me why, and said that she had 5 hours left in the day. 

I told her to clock out if she can’t do her job. She got very angry and said that I had to provide reasonable accommodations for her disability. I told her that self diagnosed anxiety isn’t a disability, so she can do her job or leave. 

She quit, threatened a lawsuit, and walked out. When we returned to work on Tuesday (today), I noticed a couple of employees were a bit cold to me. The other ones were very eager to show me the unfavorable posts that their former coworker had made on social media over the weekend. They think I should apologize to her and make her go away (they’re afraid it will cause us to lose business and cut hours). 

I can tell that some employees are upset about my behavior. I’m not sure how to feel about how it went down, so I’m curious who a third party would think is the asshole in this situation.

Nearing the final presentation day, I emailed the teachers and her about how she didn't do any work, and that all the work on the project was our own. I respectfully asked that she be removed from our group, or at least given an F for the project. She replied and said that she had done work all year, and to look at the slides for her work. I exposed her again by showing the timestamp on her work, and pointing out all the mistakes and errors in what she threw together. I scrambled to fix her ""work"" before the final presentation.

His wife and I didn't know each other prior to their marriage, but we have a mutual friend that we know from our college days. A few months ago, I met up with some friends from college, including said mutual friend, to catch up and have a good time. At one point, we were talking about marriage (one of my friends at the meetup was planning his wedding), and I brought up how I might settle down soon once I find a good girl.

9571,Not the A-hole,"This is going to be heavy on details but I feel like it is necessary to understand the situation.

&#x200B;

My husband and I have been married for 10 years, we have two kids, J (7M) and L (3F). Both the pregnancies and the process before them were extremely taxing on me both physically and mentally. I suffer from PCOS (Polycystic ovary syndrome) and with that comes fertility issues as well as higher risk of miscarriages. My husband is well aware of that.

&#x200B;

When we were trying to get pregnant for the first time I had to make use of fertility meds and ended up getting pregnant twice only to miscarry later. The first at 5 weeks and the second at 11 weeks. This took a hit on me but my husband was very supportive at the time and we decided to try again. That was when I got pregnant with J and I was scared for 33 weeks because I was thought I would miscarry him as well.

&#x200B;

2 years after that my husband asked if I wanted to have another baby, I said yes and we went through the same route. I used fertility meds and ended up getting pregnant only to miscarry. Except this time it was much harder for me because I was 19 weeks along and I was very much attached. I ended up having to go to a therapist after that. 

&#x200B;

After that I ended up getting pregnant on accident and that was when L was born, although I didn't have to go through the stress of trying and using meds, I was terrified though the entire pregnancy and had to go back to my therapist. I ended up staying with the therapist even after L was born because I was scared of developing Postpartum Depression. This was when things got a bit rocky between me and my husband, because he kept saying I was over exaggerating and that I didn't have a reason to worry since L came out just fine.

&#x200B;

We overcame that and were living our life just fine when in the beginning of this year my husband started asking me if I didn't want to have another kid. I told him that no, because of all the reasons I stated above. He seemed to accept my answer only to come back a few months later to ask me about this again. The last time he asked me was last week and he has now started to drop hints about it every other day. 

&#x200B;

My husband had made it clear that he wanted to have a lot of kids but I thought that he would understand that this is something I cannot give to him. I understand that I say that I don't want to but it's more like I can't do it, there's noting to assure me that I won't miscarry again. His argument is that since L was an accidental pregnancy and I didn't have any issues while pregnant (I told him that I did, but he focused on the physical side of it) then we could just try without using meds and see what happens.",29,28,0.89,AITA for not wanting more kids while my husband does?,c7y9n9,2019-07-01 19:01:58,NTA,2738,AITA
8943,No A-holes here,"  During a conversation with my friends they started talking about having kids, they have been married for a while now and they believe it should be their next step. I knew what was coming because they had asked our other friends the same thing before coming to me. Their question was that if I believed they would be good parents because they had a feeling about it and they were confident that this was the right moment.

The possible asshole moment happened when I told them that I don't think they would. I said this because they have an unhealthy relationship with money and I believe kids require some sort of stability. They have terrible spending habits and I know that touching on the subject of finances isn’t very tasteful, but it’s kinda hard when it’s very public knowledge at this point. They have a lot of debt because they tend to live way above their own means and they have a history of taking out loans with some sketchy people frequently. The most notable thing is that they have been kicked out of 4 places by now because they failed to pay rent and it’s always because they want to go on some trip and not paying rent is what they consider cutting costs.

4813,Asshole,"So, my fiance and I get married in about a year and a half. We have our wedding invite list planned out already and it does not included his oldest, hometown friend Jake.

The problem is Jake is a wild card. The guy is nothing like my fiance; they were buddies growing up, but they are totally different people. To be blunt - Jake is kind of trash. He's not even a nice guy, he's kind of an asshole. Something important to note is Jake assumes he is going to be my fiance's best man. The second we got engaged he texted my fiance ""I can't wait to be your best man!"" Very presumptuous but the guy has zero self-awareness.

The reason we do not want to invite Jake to our wedding is because of the following situations:

* In my opinion, the biggest problem is how he acts with other women. He's the type to flirt incessantly with waitresses or anybody in his immediate view and he think he has ""big game."" In his head, he is smooth and girls like him. In reality, these girls are pretty embarrassed and tend to give us ""help me""-looks. I have never, once witnessed a girl reciprocate any interest in him and frankly, it's because he is creepy. So, our main worry at the wedding is that he will flirt with all of my girl friends and be that ""creepy"" guy at the wedding. I can just picture now people saying ""wow it was a nice wedding but what was up with that one creepy guy hitting on girls left and right who were clearly uninterested?"" That thought terrifies me, lol
* The second issue is the amount he drinks. Jake drinks very heavily and gets so emotional when he drinks. For example, we went up to visit my fiance's friends a couple of months ago and we were all hanging out at someone's house in the early afternoon; no one was drinking except for Jake. He opened up a bottle of vodka and began taking swigs and by 2pm, he was incredibly drunk. Suddenly, we look over and Jake is in tears. He's silently crying ... it was so weird. My fiance's friends ask him what's wrong and he says how much he is going to miss my fiance when he gets married. ???? I'm also sitting in the room when he's saying this! My fiance has been seeing Jake for like once a year for the past 10 or so years. It's nothing new. The point of that example is... how is he going to act at a wedding with an open bar? What if he has a meltdown at the wedding?

My fiance has always felt they have nothing in common, but Jake idolizes my fiance and thinks of him as his best friend. My fiance is such a nice guy and is worried about what not inviting him to the wedding will do to him. Jake's heart will undoubtedly be broken, but this is our wedding we are talking about! I think it's alright to be selfish a little.

Long story short, I was under the impression that my sister was okay with my daughter using her stethoscope. When my daughter asked me if it would be okay to take it to school for some sort of project, I said yes, thinking that she’d probably asked my sister as well.

I love that this kid is so loved, it's amazing to be so supported but she's not even here yet and I'm so overwhelmed by how much the pregnancy/ childbirth/ kid having process is consuming my day to day life. 

I just dont want to talk about it any more. I dont want to talk about my nipples. I dont want to talk about names. Or strechmarks or fucking clothes and diapers. So anytime someone brings it up, I just shrug it off or troll them with nonsense answers. Like telling them we're gonna name her Chalupa Batman, or Xena or some shit like that.

People are starting to notice, and I'm getting remarks. People, namely the women in my familial circle, are having hurt feelings, telling me I'm sucking the fun out of this for them. That I need to take it seriously, stop being so rude, people are just trying to help, that I'm a Debbie Downer, ect. Mom gave me a lecture about how when you're pregnant, it's not about you anymore.

I've put months into organizing this and believe me - it's gonna be a HUGE thing.

My only excuse is that I've never celebrated my birthday before and I'm going all out. I've also worked as a wedding planner before and know some people, so I get a few discounts ;)

Anyway: my goddaughter is usually a lovely girl. She's the daughter of a friend I've known since birth ( who is also coming to the party) and we've been very close over the years. She graduated from university a few years back and moved pretty far away for work but we've stayed in contact as best as we could.

I have always supported her, both emotionally and  financially. A few years ago we made the deal that we would try to meet up once every three to four months - sometimes we'd go explore a new city, sometimes we'd go to a spa, things like that.

Well, a year ago my goddaughter started skipping out on me.

Twice she cancelled on me just for me to find out through SM that she was ""spontaneously"" going on trips with friends. The hurtful thing about this is that we would always find dates for our meetings months in advance and if she couldn't make it, I had no problem with rescheduling. She never did that, she just cancelled.

Over the months I tried to rationalize that she was a young woman just getting started with her life and maybe just wanted to spend her time differently - but she never talked to me or her mum about it, just kept taking my money and pretended to be excited to see me, only to then cancel on me.

Last weekend was the last straw - we planned for her to drive to my town so we could go to a concert together, which she had gifted me as a christmas present last year. She never showed. Instead I heard from her mother that GD had apparently lost her wallet. GD never explained anything to me, never rescheduled.

After considering all this, I decided to shoot her a text and uninvited her from my birthday. Guess what? She immediately called me back, acting completely surprised and hurt. I told her my reasoning and she became enraged, telling me I was TA for uninviting me just because life had gotten in the way a few times. Her mother is not currently speaking to me even though she knows the entire story.

Could I have misread the situation?

&#x200B;

Edit: to make this clear! I did not uninvite her because I thought she wasn't going to show. She's been very excited to come to my party since I invited her.

20083,Not the A-hole,"I (36F) live in a house that I own with a lodger (34F) who has lived with me for 9 years. We've had other lodgers come and go in that time but it's just the 2 of us at the moment.

For personal reasons there are bad memories for me in the house but I haven't been able to afford to move until now.

Recently I received some money and decided I'd like to sell my current house and buy a ""forever home"" where I plan to live until I'm old. Hopefully that house will see my lodger leave and me get married again, kids etc. over the next few years.

Lodger has suggested she would like to move with me, which is great as I like having her around and the rental money is useful. But has now started making a lot of demands about features the new house ""must"" have or locations where it ""must"" be.

She's lived with me a long time and I want her to be happy in the new place but WIBTA if I chose what I want and tell her that her choice is to move with me or find somewhere else to live but I'm choosing MY forever home and not taking her wishes into account?

I'm a part time wheelchair user and expect to need to use my wheelchair more in the future so there are already quite a lot of requirements when trying to buy a suitable place for my future.

EDIT: Wow, I wasn't expecting so many responses. Thank you everyone, I've read every response so far and will try to keep up with any more.I appreciate the NTA / NAH consensus but you've raised some good points about her expectations and understanding of the situation maybe being different from mine so I'll make sure I have a calm but honest discussion with her about life goals and expectations then make a decision about whether I actually want her to make this move with me.Thank you to those who have commented with thoughtful and insightful suggestions, it helps to stop and think about how she might be feeling and what her motivations might be.

EDIT2: Lots of people are asking what a lodger is. I own the house, she pays me rent to live with me. She has her own bedroom and shares the kitchen/lounge/bathroom etc with me. We are friends and get on together pretty well, as you'd hope after living with someone nearly a decade. She is not my carer and there has never been any romantic relationship between us.

The fact that I knew we had the funds to pay for school meant that I applied to my top choices (all private colleges) which are all 50k/year and up.

Last month, my younger brother was diagnosed with a rare heart disorder that needs immediate surgery or his life could be in danger. My parents are beside themselves and want to give him the best in the country. Since it's pretty high-tech surgery, they want to take him to like the absolute best hospital in the world for this procedure but it's ridiculously expensive (there are tons other options at other hospitals but they only want the best). My mom sat me down the other day and told me that they'll have to take the money they've saved for my tuition and use it on my brother's medical bills.

AITA for being really mad/upset over this? I get the severity of my brother's health issues, but I feel like they could maybe settle for a cheaper procedure at a less famous hospital?

1) this is my 2nd wife, first wife passed away a bit over 3 years ago

2) i had 3 kids with my past wife, 2 of which are now in college in our home country (egypt), i had no kids with my current wife

3) i don't live in egypt, im working in ksa, my wife and 3rd child live in ksa with me, we do go to egypt on vacations

4) our house in egypt is big, 2 living rooms, 2 doors, etc. it sort of looks like 2 houses, with a small hallway between the 2 living rooms, however, we usually have the hallway room open as we do move between the 2 living rooms alot (houses are NOT separated)

5) People involved : M - me
                                    W - wife
                                    SIL - sister in law
                                    C - children (ones in egypt)


so, W needed to get some papers from our room back in egypt, she had left the keys with SIL when we last went, so SIL took the keys and went to house (SIL does not live near us), C were sitting at home, and heard movement in the other living room, which scared them, but they decided to check it out, it was SIL, She got the papers and decided to stay for 2 days as her home is far, no problem, house is big, besides she's my SIL, so there's no issue w her staying

now during those 2 days, she was going around like there's no one in the house, refusing to eat with C, (always bought/made her own food), barely talked to them, and most of the time kept the hallway door closed (locked w a key)

naturally, C got annoyed by that, when i talked to W about it, and told her that SIL should have informed C that she was coming instead of just getting in without anyone's knowledge, and shouldn't have locked the hallway door, as C sometimes go to the other living room (honestly didn't care if she didn't wanna interact w C, if she doesn't want to, it's wrong to force an interaction)

W took it really personal, her main point was ""why should my sister ask your kids for permission to get into my house, or lock a door in it""

to which i responded to with ""there's nothing such as your house! this is everyone's house, your sister should've respected that there are people in that house, she should inform them, not ask for permission, and she shouldn't lock doors for no reason, as it's  a really gesture""

I told her that I don't think I could help her with that and that I was sorry and then the light turned green so I kind of just drove off. As I was in the process of declining her she said something like ""oh, please don't be like that"" which I can't stop thinking about now.

I did pull over at the next light and call 911 and told them her location and what had happened. Her description and what she said happened and what vehicle I saw just before speeding away from the road she was on. They thanked me for the info and said they'd send someone right out to check.

To give context, my parents, as they had done with my brother, made a bank account when I was born and put my savings into it. This included random money I got from family, and a monthly allowance the government gives parents for, well, being parents. Parents have no obligation to give this money to their children, but my parents do it because they want to. The account has me as the main holder and my mother as the legal representative. The spoken deal is that I'll be free to use the money from this account once I graduate from college. My parents are also divorced.



Recently, I turned 18. I have another bank account which I use daily, from the same branch. Yesterday, I had to go to the bank to sign some papers to get everything sorted. When getting account access, aside from getting access to my day to day account, I also got access to that savings account, since they're from the same bank. There, I noticed that there were a lot of movements, way more than the supposed monthly deposit. 



As it seemed to me, my mother was borrowing money from my account and then depositing it again. But on one of the movements, 2000€ were taken and they were never put back. I found that odd, but I didn't know how much money I had there before as records only went back 12 months. I still found it strange though, and consulted with my father.



Well as it seems, this wasn't normal at all, she never asked for my permission or even mentioned a thing to me or to my father. After confirming this wasn't normal, I decided to confront my mother.



When I got home, I showed my mother the bank transactions and asked her to explain what was going on. She started screaming at me, asking me how I got access to that, saying that I betrayed her and went to speak with my father before speaking with her, and that she didn't have the obligation to put the money in that account. I told her that I simply didn't like that she took the money without asking me, since I had no problem with borrowing the money. She was having none of it, she kept screaming at me and insisting I acted wrongly and should have spoken with her first. 

She also said that first thing on Monday she was getting a loan and giving me the 2000€ back, but that wasn't the issue for me and IMO she blew everything completely out of proportion. Also, she said that she didn't want me living with her anymore, and that my father did something similar with my brother's account. She told me to go live with my father, and asked me to pretend that she doesn't exist anymore. That includes meals.


I believe I handled everything maturely, I simply went to my father first because I didn't want to accuse my mother of anything unnecessarily. When I approached her I did so calmly but she instantly turned it around on me. I barely spoke, she just screamed at me the whole time and didn't want to hear me.

9163,Not the A-hole,"I use public transport to get to work and I need to change a train and several buses. The last bus and the shortest ride I take is the same bus one of my coworkers uses. I dislike her A WHOLE LOT. She's an edgy dipshit who thrives on making other people feel like shit. *Oh, you jog? Well, I HATE JOGGING, it's for hippy losers and fat moms. Oh, you liked the last Avengers movie? Well, I THINK IT'S FOR MENTALLY CHALLENGED CHILDREN. Oh, your eyes are brown. THE COLOR OF SHIT*.

I'm exaggerating but only slightly. She will turn every conversation into a diatribe about what she hates, what she thinks is stupid, and in what many ways you are dumber than her. Most other coworkers just sort of wait until she's done and leave or ignore her completely and leave before she gets the chance to start talking, but as soon as I met her, she seemed to really enjoy making ME in particular feel like shit and I couldn't escape her. So I made it a point to tell her if she was going to have that attitude, she shouldn't speak to me at all. We don't work together, we just run into each other in the hallway sometimes, so it doesn't affect our work. Now, we just say hi and move on.

A few days ago, another coworker, who just recently joined my department, told me that sometimes he sees me from a distance while I'm waiting for the bus. And he said that he usually sees that other girl as well. So he asked me if we really never notice each other at the station or what? I said that no, we say hi to each other but we don't talk. He started laughing and asked why, and I gave him an abridged version: We don't get along. He said that's ridiculous and no, really, what's the real reason?? And I said, honestly, we don't get along. She hates everything I like and makes sure to tell me so every time we talk. I don't have the energy for that ever, let alone at 7am.

I talked to my friend about it after work and she thinks I made a mistake by telling him the truth. She thinks that he should have the right to meet the other girl and see what she's like for himself. Maybe she would be nice to him.

I said I doubt it because she has yet to be nice to someone, but that's not the point. It does look kind of weird that we're there at the bus station, 2 meters away from each other, every morning, not talking at all. What was I supposed to say? Lie to him? How much and for how long?

We agreed to see the movie with her 10 year old because he is also a fan of horror. (Mom's choice, so whatever). So I sent her a fb message today asking when she wanted to go. She replies telling me that she hasn't had enough quality time with her 10 year old, so they went to see it themselves.

14085,Not the A-hole,"This girl in my hometown that I know but am not good friends with started selling “original” art about a year ago. Like many others, I was a fan and was going to support her because I really liked it! However, she was charging too much for me to buy anything, so I just shared and supported her on social media whenever she posted. She only drew acrylic floral arrangements in bright colors and everyone loved them. 

Recently, she posted a new type of art. It looked drastically different from her old stuff, and she said she had started doing digital art so I just accepted that was the difference. It was simply cleaner. 

THEN she suddenly started posting incredibly clean painting of famous landmarks and buildings from our town. I was blown away, so much so that I knew something was off. I simply commented, asking if she was drawing them by hand because it was incredible. She sent me a private message and explained she had done them with her apple pen on a tablet.. so I responded by asking “Is it like you start with picture and do your art over it like an edit?” She answered with “Yeah pretty much! I’m terrible at creating straight lines so it helps me get the outline then I do all the color work! Lol” 


So she was literally just tracing photos and coloring in the lines and selling them for a lot of money.... I was so surprised, but I just left it alone. But then it got worse when I stumbled upon a famous artist’s website that is famous for her acrylic floral art (her name is Erin Gregory). This girl from my town had done the same thing since the beginning!! She was literally copying Erin Gregory almost exactly. The style, arrangement, colors, everything. And selling it for tons of money in our small town to people that wouldn’t know! Then she just had moved to other types of art to copy to expand her portfolio.

14633,Not the A-hole,"Background: This guy (Dave) and my fiance have been best friends since 2nd grade. Dave has untreated bipolar (that he refuses to treat) and over the last 2 years has become increasingly difficult to be around. He complains constantly and sometimes has a violent temper.

He's also a member of my weekly tabletop group where he spends most of every session bitching about his life situation, his ex or sniping at/attacking my fiance. He barely interacts with anyone's characters but mine and even snipes at Fiance in character.

His life is in the toilet right now and we're like his only friends...

What really makes me uncomfortable is:

-He constantly (but only when we're alone) brings up rumors  he's ""heard"" about me faking my disability (I'm an ambulatory wheelchair user with Ehlers Danlos) or about what a terrible parent I was (due to my worsening health I gave up custody of my son to his grandparents).

-He keeps bringing up this other girl he likes and how she was fat and shy in highschool but got into rock climbing and is super fit and confident now -- including showing me before & after pics. I'm in treatment for bulimia/possible Atypical Anorexia, which he knows about.

-He keeps saying stuff like ""if it weren't for fiance, I'd totally try to go out with you"" or tells me if Fiance and I broke up, he'd side with me.

-He keeps giving me money and I can't shake the feeling that eventually a ""I bought you dinner, you owe me"" moment will happen. 

Anyway, on Saturday I was talking with the host of game group about why Dave would constantly attack his ""best friend"" and Host goes ""He's jealous of <fiance> and wants to get in your pants? It's been obvious since day one.""

Hearing it so bluntly kinda made all the pieces fall into place and I freaked out a bit. 

I've been becoming more and more uncomfortable around Dave for years but I kept making excuses for him ""he's just having a rough time"" or ""it's just the bipolar"".

On Sunday, I told my fiance how I felt and that we needed to break it off with Dave. He agreed but I feel guilty.

I live in a non English speaking European country and because of history that means land borders between properties are sometimes very weird. Well that is the case with my house and the neighbors, all our houses are about the same size yet out of all the land behind our houses my area is huge I own like 90% of all land there reaching all the way to the woods far behind our houses, meanwhile all my neighbors essentially got tiny strip right behind their houses.

Now the part right behind my house is fenced off yet the rest is pretty much open and my wife and daughters like to use it for gardening. 

The field is used by most of the neighborhood boys to play football on as it is the only flat piece of grassland around they always ask for permission to use it before hand and I always allow it on the condition I get no complaints if I tell them to leave and they don't litter. 

I also recently had a pool installed to the far back of my property and fenced it off, this is important later.

Well this is where the issue starts, recently a new family moved in and they seem to think it is public land. I kept catching their kids running around through the flowers and vegetable garden and they even moved their grill on the field and held a picnic on my land. I keep telling them off and informing it is my land, but they just ignore me and the kids sometimes wont leave when I tell them to. A month ago the kids even climbed over the fence around the pool  and when I got them out and went to their parents they just said ""Oh we figured it was a public pool"", I had hoped that was the end of it yet these people build a fire pit in the 3 days I was away from my house and when I got back I found it with a bunch of empty beer cans around.

That was the last straw for me and I hired a company owned by a buddy of mine from when I used to do construction work, bought all the supplies, and 7 days later and a lot of money lighter my entire property was walled off and whenever anyone asked I told them why I was doing that and who they could thank for it.

Well now the new family is treated as if they are a pest and all the neighborhood kids are gutted they lost their football field which has resulted in them picking on the new neighbors kids

Instead of cancelling the order that was already sent out to the restaurant, we decided to just wait for our food to arrive and then tip the delivery driver with cash at the door. 

When the driver arrived, however, he came up to our doorstep glaring at us and just dropped our food on the porch before we even had the opportunity to hand him the tip. At this point I was kinda pissed so I just closed the door instead of attempting to run him down and hand him the 20.

9939,Not the A-hole,"Soo. My wife and I just had our first child, and we couldn’t be happier about it! We both have a strict religious background and that brings us all here.

First of all, that religion is extremely conservative about everything (for example birth control, listening to rhytmic music and even watching TV is forbidden). We both have religious families and they have brought us into that cult. However, my wife and I decided that we will not raise our child with their rules, because we don’t believe in those. Almost all of our friends are from that religion too and all of my friends are very conservative. We have no problem telling this to my wifes friends, because they are very open-minded about these things, but my friends are the problem.

They stalk me and remind me if I haven’t attented in cults events and act like they are worried about the strength of my faith. I haven’t told them, that we don’t believe like they do anymore, because i’m afraid that they try to effect to my parents and siblings who are still in that shit. So in conclusion I have decided, that I will ghost them out of our lives. We already have moved to other town because my school is here, and i haven’t called them in few months. They have been calling me few times, but I haven’t answered them. I heard from some other people that my ”friends” have already spoke about me and my wife, that we are serving the wrong god and turning our backs to the realms of god.

- no rhytmic music
- no TV or movies or anything
- no opera or theatre
- no dancing (causes lust apparently)
- no premarital sex
- no birth control (I have 9 siblings)
- no moving together before marriage
- no kissing before marriage
- no swearing

- no pearcings or coloring your hair
- no drugs

My BF and I went out for a dinner date last night, to a decently upscale small plates restaurant--the type where you order multiple plates over the course of the evening. 15 or so minutes after we're seated, the bartender comes over and asks if ""R,"" our waiter, had gotten our drinks order. Not yet, which in my mind isn't a good sign. We put in our drinks and appetizer order, and continue to wait.

30 minutes later (45 total), R finally comes by. We've noticed that since then, he had seated and taken the dinner orders of two other couples who came in after us. Feeling completely ignored and very hungry, BF and I are displeased.

Over the course of our two hour meal (service was very slow, but I don't know how much of that was R's fault), R comes by a total of two more times. As service had felt completely mediocre, when our split check came, I wrote 0.00 in for the tip and wrote a note at the bottom: ""dreadfully slow service."" Once we left, my BF expressed him being upset with me doing this. His rationale was a) a 10% minimum tip would've been sufficient without hurting R's livelihood, and b) if I was so annoyed, I should've said something in person.

Is that true? AITA?

I'm reading from my phone but after a while I look up and see the girl just staring me so I raise my eyebrow at her but she doesn't say anything, she just keeps staring at me like I disgust her. So finally I ask ""What's your problem?"" She says ""Could you maybe not sit there?""

A middle-aged lady scootches by and asks if anyone's sitting there, and I say no but the girl says ""Yeah, I am, but not if he's sitting there. He gives me the creeps,""

I say ""Woah lady, you got problems. If you don't wanna sit, other people do,"" but the other lady is too polite to ask so I just stare back at the girl. Another passenger, another middle-aged lady, asks me if it's okay to swap seats with me. I see what she's doing and decide fine, whatever.

As we both get up to swap, a dude quickly sits down in her spot. The older lady, seeing how I got jacked, got up and offered me back my spot, but I let it go. The dude quickly put on his head phones and pretended to sleep and I seriously fought the urge to just rip his ear buds out and tell him to get off (but I didn't because I'm a coward).

Meanwhile the girl finally sat down and is smirking at me so now I'm stuck standing for my hour-long commute home. So I tell the kind lady I changed my mind, and I'd like my seat back, which means now I'm sitting down next to the girl, who looks absolutely disgusted, and the poor, kind lady who tried to be a diplomat is now suffering because she tried to do the right thing. Since the dude who's pretending to sleep has his eyes closed, everyone just stares at me for screwing everything up.

I tell my friends about this and the girls say I should've just manned up and let it go. The guys say it's good that I stood up for myself instead of getting screwed over and just taking it. The girls say that by insisting on sitting next to that girl, I'm proving that I'm a creep. I tell them it's her problem to deal with. I was just sitting on the bus minding my own business, so if they think that's creepy, they can go screw themselves. Now the girls are calling me a creep and the guys and I just left.

He simply replied it was his name on the lease so he could do whatever, however he'd talk to her about cleaning up after herself.

Two months ago a guy joined.  He seemed friendly enough but suspected he had a learning disability.

One of my regulars told me that he had been messaging her and that it was strange.  I saw the texts he sent her; kinda weird, not dirty or explicit, more like a very socially awkward attempt at flirting.  She didn’t seem very upset about it but was slightly uncomfortable.

Then I remembered he would always ask about where female members were if they didn’t attend but never the men. 

During next meeting I clearly reiterate the rules like keep it platonic, not dating group etc and thought he would get the message.  

So,  a new woman joined the group and was also present for this.   I don’t know much about her but I did hear her ask the guy to meet up some time near the end of the meeting.  

A couple of days later I get many messages from her saying the guy has been texting her a lot saying how attracted he is to her.  Also, when they did meet up she went into some shop, told him to wait outside, he walked off.  She seems pretty angry at him but that’s all I know and haven’t seen any messages he sent to her.

By now I had to make a decision, 2 women were complaining about his messages and feeling uncomfortable despite me reiterating the rules. I decided to ban him and message him why.

Next thing I know his family are texting me saying how horrible I am and should accept his behaviour as he is a good person and had Asperger’s.  Tell them I get it but I have others to consider others and he is aggravating their own issues.  Also, it’s a group for anxiety not specific learning difficulties.

His family kept trying to join the group so set up a secret new location and told members privately.  

Secret meeting goes ahead but somehow the guy shows up.  Don’t know how this happened but my guess is the second woman, who didn’t show up, told him.

  
 I ask him to leave, he is really apologetic and says he walked off from the meeting with the second woman because she was being weird with him.

Once these are lifted, my plan is to leave ASAP before I lose the chance. After hearing this, my mom went on a guilt tripping tirade of what will happen to them & it was my responsibility to care for them. My dad has dementia and is being cared for by my elderly mom. 

Since I was a child, my mom has always expected me to take care of them. I am the only daughter and have 3 brothers.

I have a complicated relationship with my parents. My dad had a gambling addiction and was an alcoholic. He gambled our house away and put my mom in debt. My mom had to become the sole bread winner. But she was not a perfect mom. She was always in competition with me. Nothing I did was ever good enough. She would be the first one to point out I was gaining weight and that she was the skinny one. When I first got a bf, she said how I would go to hell. Just before my prom, she told me that the hairdresser thought that my friend was her daughter. That would have been fine, except my mom told me, it must have been because my friend was the pretty one so of course they would think she was her daughter. The one time I needed her help was to help me talk to her boss because I worked as an intern for her company. I needed a letter of recommendation for a scholarship. Since I worked for that company, I asked my mom if she could help talk to her boss to get the letter. She refused coz she said she had made up a story about me not being in the country & it would be a big embarrassment if people found out I was around. There are more, but essentially, I feel that I have a lot of deep-seated insecurities and issues because of my upbringing. 

In highschool, I got a fully funded scholarship so I didn’t have to be fully reliant on her anymore. Eventually, I was able to move abroad for university and work. I moved back to the country because I got married. I suddenly had contact with my parents again. Each time was an emotional roller coaster and I would go back to my husband a wreck. I felt miserable & guilty for trying to stand up for myself but also for being disrespectful to my mom. 

My husband recently passed away and after trying to grieve for a few months, I want to move overseas so I can re-start my life. My mom is now going on again how it’s my responsibility to take care of them and how awful of a person I am. I feel like if I had a child, I wouldn’t want to burden them with me.

3256,Asshole,"Throwaway because people know my account.

I (F36), have been married to my husband (M40), for 9 years now. When I first met him about 12 years ago, he was on the chubbier side, but I wouldn't say he was massively overweight. He stayed near enough that way for a long time.

About a year ago, he began going to the gym frequently and focused on his weight tremendously. The effects became apparent quickly. He transformed his body and became pretty fit. Of course, I supported him and tried my best to help him throughout his journey.

Yesterday, we were cuddling in bed and I made what I thought was a 'harmless' comment. I jokingly told him that cuddling was better back then before his weight loss because he was squishier. I didn't mean any harm towards him. However, I could instantly tell he didn't like it and he left to the bathroom quickly. After he returned he said he was tired of cuddling and to 'leave him alone'.

8487,Not the A-hole,"This has been bothering me for awhile so I hoped to get some insight from reddit. Obligatory mobile warnings do throwaway.

Some context: I have been diagnosed with c-PTSD for the last 3.5 years, mainly stemming from abuse and neglect from my immediate family. My parents are both doctors (psychiatrist and retired ER doc), both have been aware of my diagnosis and treatment for at least that long.

Last month was my mother’s 65th birthday, the family reserved a table at a really nice restaurant and invited the immediate family as well as our respective SOs. My bf came along but no other SOs had the time to attend. Nonetheless, being with my family in a public setting makes me extremely anxious and I often have to leave to go to a private area in order to practice breathing techniques, etc. I left once about an hour in after a few drinks, was gone for 10 minutes and returned- everything was going fine and the family was reminiscing, it was actually extremely pleasant.

That is until my twin turns to me and says the exact words ‘hey do you remember when we tortured you-?’ In a joking manner. Though I am sure it was a joke, they were referring to when my family would essentially push me to clean up dog shit in an alley beside our house- the smell was so awful it would make me throw up multiple times (which I would have to clean up as well) and so on and so forth. My brain immediately shut down and I retreated to the bathroom with my bf at the table. He texted me asking if I wanted to leave and - due to the fact I was on the verge of a panic attack or something equally awful - I agreed. My father followed my bf out of the restaurant and immediately started berating me in public for not acting more respectfully, when I tried to explain to him I needed to leave he simply told me I was full of shit (he’d been doubtful of my diagnosis from the start) to which I told him to fuck off quite loudly which got the attention of nearby people. I left quickly and he retreated into the restaurant. We have been on thin ice with one another since. I apologized to my mother and she was extremely understanding, which I appreciate immensely.

I later attempted to explain to him via text but he simply demanded an apology, this man is also the psychiatrist.

My girlfriend is aware of this, yet she can't understand my lack of respect for the mother.

He sends friend requests to every person he’s ever met and then comments on other people’s posts AS HIS KIDS and FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE.

Gosh mommy and daddy’s house is nice” or “daddy got promoted today, he’s the smartest guy in the world”.

These kids are 2.5 and just newly born.

Anyway, I removed myself as a friend from the oldest child’s “account”, and declined the “request” from the newest child because his posts annoy the hell out of me and, since he tags himself and his wife, I see them multiple times anyway.

20674,Not the A-hole,"I am (26M) and my dad is (40M). Yes, you’re reading that right, he was fourteen when I was born. 

In 1990, my dad went through something traumatic which resulted in his mom bailing and he was raised solely by my abuelo (63) my dad and his family are Mexican). Dad went through a few years of shit and did some stupid things for a kid, one of them resulting in me but he got through it and even managed to make things work with my mom until she sadly passed away in 2010 aged only 30.

My dad thought about his mom a lot but he also had a lot of hatred towards her for abandoning him so he didn’t have any real interest in finding her. Years go by and aw he got older he was content with it just being us and his dad. 

Anyway, he recently got a message from an older woman who was in her early 60s like my abuelo. She claimed to be his mother and ill be honest, there was a high chance she was. She shared a lot of similarities with my dad’s actual mom: she had the exact same name, was born in 1957 and knew a lot of details only she would know. I knew for a fact it was her but didn’t want to take the chance even though my dad decided to. I said that this woman is virtually a stranger and whilst she is most likely his mom, we should get a DNA test just to be 100% accurate. 

Dad agreed and we set up a meeting with this woman. (Since were allowed to now) She looked remarkably like my grandma in old pictures I’ve seen but we were still cautious. Dad and I both expressed our concerns and that we wanted a DNA test to prove beyond a doubt she was who she says she is. Well, she got highly offended and said we didn’t need one as it was obvious she was who she was saying she was. My dad remained quiet but I basically said to her “I’m not doubting you but you’re a stranger to us and we just want proof if we’re going to try and make things work.”

She has refused and my dad and I walked away. She has since been messaging constantly saying it is an AH move to expect a dna test when it’s clear it’s his mother and I’ve retaliated by saying to her back saying it was an AH move to abandon him and expect to be welcomed back in open arms. Apparently that comment was too harsh according to my abuelo and that I need to chill and that the DNA thing was maybe too far. AITA?

Update: I should add the woman confirmed a lot of details in messages to my dad that only he and my abuelo would know and my abuelo confirmed it so maybe that’s why he doesn’t need a DNA test as he believes strongly it’s her but I’m still unsure and my dad is still suspicious

Update 2: to those saying it’s so obvious it’s my grandma and that I’m just demanding a DNA to score points, that’s not the point. Yes she has private info only she knows and her identity has been confirmed by my abuelo, this woman is a stranger to me. I have no idea who she is and just want solid confirmation of who she is.

16349,Not the A-hole,"Hi guys! So me (23f) and my fiancé (33m) have been together for two years. He’s honestly amazing and I’d do anything for him, hence what I did a couple months ago:

So he’s terrible with his money. He had a lot of debt and had no idea how to manage his finances. So he let me take over and become his accountant. 

I have a bank account I set up in both of our names that all his bills gets paid from. This includes our rent and utilities (that we split) and his bills like his car, car insurance, and what not. 

He had a lot of credit card debt, but because his credit score was so terrible, he couldn’t get approved for a no interest balance transfer. So I put it in my name. (I KNOW I KNOW but hey I’m gonna marry him so does it matter anyway??)

So whatever money is left from his paycheck after all the bills gets direct deposited into his own bank account. This ranges from 100-200 depending on how many hours he worked that week. 

So here’s my problem.. he smokes weed a lot. No big deal, it’s legal here and I don’t mind. Except it’s his number one priority when it comes to his money. He overdrafted his account last week to buy some and due to the overdraft fees and not the greatest paycheck this week, he didn’t have much this week and overdrafted again. (It’s only Sunday and he has to make it until Thursday)

Now the reason I’m really upset is because I added him to my AMEX and told him he can use it whenever he’s in a bind. He uses it all the time. And it adds up, so now I got myself in some debt. He also kept his own personal credit card during this time for emergencies and racked up a balance on that, which he can’t pay for because he keeps overreacting his account to buy weed. 

So all my hard work in getting his credit score up is for nothing because of all his missed payments on the other credit card.

8171,Not the A-hole,"We have a 6 year old corgi chihuahua.  After my husband passed from cancer 3 years ago, I (F54) talked to my daughter (then 15)  about getting another dog. She had been asking for one, and I thought it would help us with the grief to rebuild the family a bit and have something to focus on.  After much research and visiting and about six months, we got an obese elderly long-haired miniature dachshund, Coco.  The vet estimated her at least 10 years old, she has back problems, and about three teeth.  She also turned out to be completely incontinent and unhousetrainable.  Carpets are destroyed, house smells like a barn, I'm shampooing carpet every week.  She is a fat sassy old lady, and we love her.  

She has had many health problems, expected for an older dog, and a chronic disease that is expensive to manage ($300 blood test 3x a year, and meds are $50 a month). I've had to postpone the blood tests a few months for finance reasons, but only if she's doing well with no symptoms.   

My daughter and I both expected this would be ""her"" dog and she would bond closely, but that didn't happen. (The other dog is more my son's, who's grown and gone).  She plays with it some but mostly fusses when Coco poops in her room and gets into her snacks.  I mention that because if the dog got her through her grief and is now her support and best buddy, that would have a huge impact in my decision. That is not the case. Daughter will be upset for a while when Coco does inevitably go, but she will be ok.  

So here we go again. Something is wrong, I took her to the vet yesterday, she got a steroid shot but it's been 24 hours and she's not yet responding to the antibiotic. I have a call to the vet to get her back in.  If it's something that she can kick and she is shortly back to  normal, great.  If the vet says this is it, I won't let her suffer.  

 But - if with lots of expensive treatment and her going through pain, she will eventually be OK for a few months or a year before the next thing, WIBTA if I said let's just let her be at peace and put to sleep?  She is so old with so many issues, including some chronic pain with arthritis, and I don't want her to suffer.  But I'm questioning myself because I know I have ulterior motives - my life will be easier when the expensive, stinky little muffin is gone, but I would never get rid of her for that.  Other dogs I've had, it was very clear when it was time.  Is it more selfish to put a dog down maybe before you absolutely have to for their pain, or to keep them around longer as their comfort decreases (and to be honest as the bills rack up, which are impacting our finances) because they are funny sassy little peanut heads we will miss very much?

Update: Thank you all for your kind words. No matter how you know it’s coming and how many times you go through it, It’s hard. She’s bouncing back this morning. She’s up on her feet walking around, eating again, and is not in pain when I pick her up, although she still limping. I have a call into the vet. That’s what makes this hard, she gets these Infections and is miserable, and then Bounces back. Is the quality of life in between the bad spells worth the pain she goes through? I Felt guilty even asking the vet about her end-of-life, but based on your comments that is the first thing I will do, have a frank conversation with him about exactly what is best for her.

10263,Not the A-hole,"Some background.  I’m a 19 year old girl.  I’m out of high school and i work part time at a sandwich chain.  5 years ago my family drastically downsized from our apartment to this rented house.   The house is small but with all of our huge furniture it makes it feel smaller.  

When we moved it was just me.  My mom.  My stepdad.  And my younger brother all in this 3 bedroom 1 bath.  No big deal.  Whatever.  

I drew the short end of the stick and got the smallest room in the house.  I’m not a brat so again whatever.  

A year into living here I got into a very heated argument with my stepdad.  He tried to punch my door to intimidate me??? And to show I didn’t give a fuck about his angry outburst and I also punched my door.  

I got my door taken away.  

Now I have a curtain.  A thick black curtain.  

My sister (27) didn’t move in with us.   But she moved in with her boyfriend and that (obvi) didn’t and wasn’t gonna work out so she packed her things and moved in with us after 5 years of us being here.   She decided to share room with me.  

I don’t even have a door.  So I definitely didn’t have a say in this situation.  And I was told to stop being selfish when I protested.  

So she’s in here.  And it’s like sharing a room with a toddler. She smokes in here so my room and bed and shit smell like weed.  I smoke too but she can’t even function if she doesn’t smoke.   And I have the decency towards myself to not smoke in my small bedroom.  She leaves trash in my already small space and she keeps her shit in trash bags and a broken clothes hamper.  

I asked her if she wanted space in my small closet and I also offered to get her a new hamper.  But she just wants to act like a fucking hobo.   

She’s a horrible roommate and she’s also put multiple holes in my air mattress that we share for now because she overfills it and plops down on the bed.   I’ve bought patches.  I’ve even bought new beds but she still does the same fucking shit.  Then she snores and I mean like.  She sounds like a grown man with several breathing problems.  She shakes the whole fucking bed.  

She’s been here a year.  I haven’t slept right in a year and I haven’t been comfortable in my room for a year.  I’m about to spaz.  

Am I the asshole if I do so???

4106,Not the A-hole,"Forgive any formatting issues, on mobile.

I (22F) recently received a promotion at work, and an accompanying pay raise. Without disclosing how much I make, I’ll say that I make about 50% more now than I did in April, so it’s fairly significant. I currently live at home, as it’s the most convenient and my parents have long recommended I stay as long as possible, though I am actively looking at moving out within the next year. On to the situation at hand.

My mother wants to discuss finances with me. Not just budgeting or tips and the like, but down to the very last dollar. She wants to see my taxes, my current student loan debt, my credit card debt, my savings, my credit reports, my 401k. Anything involving my current financial state she wants to see. My father is going along with it because he doesn’t really care either way, and it’s not worth arguing with my mother.

I’ve told her again and again that I don’t think it’s necessary or proper for me to disclose that information to her, as I’m not entirely comfortable with it to begin with. I don’t think she needs access to personal information such as this, given that I’m an adult and it doesn’t impact her what I do with my money. I understand that in her mind, she is just trying to help, but I feel as though she doesn’t trust my ability to manage my own money even as a fairly independent adult.

So, Reddit, AITA here and I should just give in? Or am I in the right and should stand my ground?

Edit: There are a few things I’ve seen in comments that I want to respond to.

1) I do not pay rent at this time. I have offered but they have declined on several occasions. Their reasoning is that my father lived at home until he married my mother at age 32, and during that time he was able to focus on school, working, and saving for the future.

2) My mother brought this up when I first got promoted in July. I told her I needed some time, because with the pay increase, I wasn’t entirely sure what my biweekly pay would look like (although I am full time, I am paid hourly). About two weeks after my promotion, my company went through a pay restructure, which resulted in another pay increase and the addition of weekly bonuses. With all of these changes in mind, I told her I especially was not ready to sit down with her at that time.",24,29,0.86,AITA for not wanting to discuss my finances with my parents?,d4n0ln,2019-09-15 16:49:36,NTA,2309,AITA

For some context I have been friends with M for almost 20 years, always pretty tight and open with each other.

6 months down the line her boyfriend has asked her to move in with her, not great timing as my father has just been in a car accident which nearly took his life and I was also up for redundancy, but if this is what will make her happy then I'm fine with it. Took a couple of weeks for them to find a place and we found someone to take her room who we trust. Now all we needed to do was organise the moving date.

Now I repeatedly ask M to provide me her moving date and she first said September, then end of August and finally the beginning of August. I needed a solid date to provide my new tenant for their move, so I had a verbal agreement with M that if I wasnt provided a date by july 14th, that her moving date would be set to august the 1st. This mean i can give my new tenant a set date as they desperately need one. 

Now M decides to go to france for a 2 week holiday and does not provide me with a moving date so it's set to august 1st. 3 days ago she informs me through Facebook messenger (whilst upstairs in the same house) she wont be able to move until august 8th. I tell her this isnt really acceptable, we had an agreement and the date must stay as august 1st due to commitments I have made with other people.

After calling me unfair and saying she did everything she could have done in the situation, which I feel isnt true, she has not spoken to me since.

13094,Not the A-hole,"Hey guys. I’m in a weird spot. 

Saturday I turned 23, and we had a party to celebrate. I had 15 friends show up, some planning on staying over. Eventually, the party dwindled down to just us that were staying the night. This left me, my boyfriend, 4 other friends, my little brother (20) and Laura (25), who I had considered one of my best friends up until this. 

To preface this, here’s an event that happened a week ago. I went out with Laura, my boyfriend Michael, and Michael’s friend Kyle. We had a good time at the bars, and came back to our house to keep the party going. 

Midway through the night, Kyle and Laura started having loud, gross sex when Michael and I were in the other room for just a minute. Michael and I had an awkward laugh and waited it out in our office. That is, until they came running through our office naked to use the bathroom and throw out the condom. Michael yelled at Kyle and kicked them back out to the living room, where they had loud sex again. They left behind our torn apart living room, smashed food in the carpet, Laura’s dirty underwear, and two unopened condoms on our couch. Laura gives me a half assed apology, and Kyle gives both Michael and I an incredibly sincere apology. 

I let Laura’s stupidity slide, and invite her to my party as a peace offering. I wasn’t mad necessarily about the sex, just how rude and loud they were. She’s also had similar inconsiderate sex in our house with another friend. 

At my party, Jordan and Laura start to flirt. He’s coming off a really rough breakup not even a week prior, and his flirting seemed harmless. He’s really, really young. He acts much younger than 20, and has minimal experience with girlfriends/sex. Laura frequently has sex with different men, which is fine, except she has confided in me that she rarely uses protection. Definitely not someone I want my baby brother romping in the sack with. 

I catch them going to Laura’s bedroom at the end of the night, and I call out to my brother asking what the fuck he was doing (sorry. I was drunk, tact was not used.) She pushed him away and shut the door in Jordan’s face. I walk past, and hear the door open again and them giggling. I lay in bed with my boyfriend on my birthday night listening to Laura make the weirdest, most exaggerated sex noises that were unfortunately very familiar to us by now. The headboard knocked into the walls for my other friends to hear, as well. Literally echoed through the large house.

AITA for cutting Laura out of my life? Michael thinks I’m exaggerating. I’m just getting sick of her being so gross and inappropriate. I’m the last person to shame someone for promiscuity, but good lord. I don’t enjoy being an unwilling audience member each time, especially when my own flesh and blood involved.

1153,Asshole,"
I got engaged in August to my long time boyfriend and I immediately asked my older sister to be my maid/matron honour. When she got married 3 years ago I was her maid of honour and my sister is my best friend and I love her with all my heart. I asked 5 of my close friends to be bridesmaids. Just one month ago my Fiancé and  booked my dream venue and finalized the date for the last week of May and sent out our save the dates. Before finalizing the date we tried to make sure it was a good date for all our family and close friends. 

One week ago my sister and her husband announced she was pregnant. Obviously we were super happy for her. They had been trying for a while and this will be my first niece and nephew. I then found out she was due  the second week of June, meaning she would be 38 months pregnant at my wedding. 

When I was maid of honour for my sister I planned the bridal shower( including keeping track of all the gifts for thank you notes) planned the bachelorette party, went to almost all the shopping appointments with my sister, and was one of the main go to people at the wedding to make sure everything was going smoothly and made a speech at the wedding. I thought about it and believed this was to omuch stress to put my sister through and there was even a chance she might have to miss the wedding due to giving birth. Im a very meticulous planner and thought it would be a good idea to promote my BFF to my maid of honour and just make my sister an “honorary maid of honour” but put no expectations on her and if she is able to be at the wedding both my BFF and my sister could give speeches.

So I asked my BFF if she was interested in being maid of honor too and she was super excited. I then talked to my sister about this and she unexpectedly got very mad at me and said I was making decisions for her and punishing her for getting pregnant and it was her dream to be my maid of honour and I was being unfair and selfish. She said I was acting stuck up and like a control freak for not wanting a pregnant maid of honor.

10023,Everyone Sucks," 

I will be married 10 years in Sept. Her kid (my step daughter) just turned 18. I've been with her since she was 4 but she has NEVER showed any real love or affection towards me. Her dad is in her life. I intentionally did want want to be her ""father"" but more of a ""father figure"" in her life. Currently I have been paying for her car insurance and phone for the last 5 years. Her grandma pays for her car payment. She barely works. She is extremely lazy around the house doing absolutely NOTHING to help out. When we ask her to watch our kid she is the worst and does minimal. It's like she doesn't even care about her half sis.

&#x200B;

Months before she turned 18, I asked that her mom and her talk about what the game plan was going to be when she turned 18. Nothing happened. Big surprise.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now, she just turned 18 and moves out of the house. Partly because her mom wanted her out and partly because she decided she wanted to leave on her own. Just like that. Moves in with her bio dad. I gave her a week to figure out what to do with her phone. Does she want it? Will her dad pay for it now? Does she want to cancel it costing me $? 

&#x200B;

I really don't think I should be paying for her phone or car insurance at this point but my wife still totally baby's her to the point that she's admitted that she's ""fucked up"" in raising a spoiled entitled self absorbed selfish child. But now mom says she will pay for her phone instead of me. Yes she works, but it is our money, not mine or hers is my belief. I really don't think we should do anything and let her grow up. Especially since she decided to put her big girl pants on and move out and take all her stuff with her.

&#x200B;

NOW her dad says he can't take her! I don't want her at the house. I want her to grow up. Had she gone to school we would have continued to pay for things as long as she got good grades etc. But the moment she decided to move out, to me, all bets are off. She needs to learn consequences and accountability with I have battled with my wife for her to learn but then again, I'm only her step dad so I feel like all I'm good for is $ to her and that hurts my feelings. AITA for not wanting to pay for her stuff anymore?

Update:  I just learned that she doesn’t want to move in until I move out because she says it is “toxic” in our house.  So she is actually trying to manipulate the situation so she can get rid of me and make me divorce my wife.  Really.  It might work.  We have fought over how to raise her for years.

It's from this disney series and it's in the shape of a heart with a keyhole sort of shape. It's a nice locket, and it's pretty unique too. But to me, it's just a necklace. My girlfriend hasn't been wearing it for awhile now because she said she needed to get gold chain for it. I told her she already has a chain. But she apparently can't wear it because it's made of silver, and she's ""allergic"" to silver. I don't know how anyone can be allergic to silver, since it's in a lot of things.

1443,Asshole,"Posting from throwaway account for obvious reasons...

So my wife has these two male cousins around her age and they are total slobs. They drink a lot, eat junk food, fart/burp often, smell like they don't shower much, often have food stains and ripped clothes, and have no sense of personal hygiene. Their house is disgusting and has urine all over the toilet flood, dirt everywhere, etc.

The unfortunate thing is that physically they have features which remind me of my wife, like you can definitely tell they are related and from the same family.

Although my wife bears no similarities to my cousins with hygiene, whenever we all hang out I find myself seeing their features and mannerisms in my wife, like they laugh in the same way and make similar facial expressions (being family obviously).

I can't help it, but this makes me feel way less attracted to my wife. After hanging out with her cousins it's hard to have sex with her for a day or two because I find myself reminded of her cousins and their disgusting hygiene. I've really tried but I can't push the unease out of my mind. I'll see my wife laugh, and just think of her cousins, and then feel completely sexually turned off.

The thing is her cousins are both really friendly guys, and I have no personal problems with them. Their grubbiness doesn't effect my life in any other way, we don't live together or anything, so it feels like it's not my place to comment on it.

However, in order to preserve my sexual attraction to my wife I've found myself avoiding her cousins and making excuses not to be anywhere I know they will be. We all live in the same city and while my wife is not ""super close"" with her cousins they do catch up at least 1-2 times per month through normal socialising in her family.

Last night my wife kind of confronted me and said ""You always have a work trip or some kind of commitment which coincides with any family event where my cousins will be, do you have some kind of problem with them?"".

I was really scared to tell her the truth that I'm avoiding her cousins to maintain my sexual attraction to her. I'm generally very honest with her, but this felt like dangerous territory to step into. So instead I just made played it off like it's unfortunate that my schedule clashes with theirs so often.

Now today I find my wife wants to set up a day trip for me to do with her cousins, to make up for how little I've been able to see them recently.

Am I just being an asshole here? What should I do here? I can totally see how unreasonable this whole thing might seem to outsiders. Her cousins have done nothing bad to me, and are not bad people.

I got a dog on the advice of my therapist a few years ago. He isn't an ESA, although he does help me quite a bit. I am a veteran that has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and severe anxiety, he has helped me immensely since we've been together.  I try to take him on walks daily to get both of us exercise, we walk the same route most days.  He means the world to me, and is in my post history.

A few weeks ago a kid in a car threw a pizza crust out of the window of his friends car while we were walking down the street on the sidewalk. He said ""Hey man!"" a second before he threw it and I looked up and bonk, right in the forehead!  Nice aim really.  No worries, they are kids, I'm kind of mad but I will get over it. I keep walking, and don't think about it for a few days.

A week or so goes by and I'm walking my dog again and the same car rolls around and the same teenage kid yells out ""Hey man!"" except this time he throws a bottle of diet coke on the ground in front of me and it explodes. I stop and just glare in the direction of the car because there really isn't much I can do. The kid hangs out the window laughing and pointing. A random person comes up an says they saw the whole thing and I get their information. Apparently useful in a bit.

Last week I was walking down the same road, it's a main road in my town with a sidewalk, and the car shows up again. I bring my dog close to me so I can protect him if anything gets thrown out of the car. It turns out to be another coke bottle and this time it hits my dog in the head. He doesn't care, he's a dog and it's not that big of a deal to him. However I yell at the car to ""GO F\*CK THEMSELVES"". The car stops and the person who threw the bottle and a friend from the back seat climb out.

\- At a restaurant he would pull out my chair for me even if i had already sat down at a different seat at the same table and insist that I sit at the seat he chose for me

\- Reach across the table and brush my hair out of my face while I was eating

\- Refuse to drive me home if I sat in the the back seat. I had to sit in the passenger seat next to him

Then he hugged me and stroked my hair while I tried to pull away kept asking me to go outside with him.

I had the unfortunate fortune of being born a gay man into a very evangelical family. I came out right after high school, riding the high of being recently graduated, only for my parents to tell me I was disgusting, not the child they raised, that I was being punished by god and if I was choosing to turn my back on him, they were choosing to turn their backs on me. These are all actual, quotable things they said to me at 18. 

I’m 27 now, and while at first we were somewhat in contact, after the first 3 years or so the only way I’d hear from or about my parents was through my younger brother, the only one of my 3 siblings willing to speak to me. I am in a loving and committed relationship, I am happy, and until now I thought my parents and family were in my past. Well, lo and behold, my cousin, my fathers sisters son, just came out!! Great for him, I’m proud of him. He is also 18, and his parents were confused but accepted him and now they are doing great and are happy and are an intact family.

So basically I've become best friends with this latin-american guy at a language school in Japan. First time I saw him I instantly had a crush on him cause he's completely my type, handsome, thick and muscular, has the most jaw-dropping smile I've ever seen in a guy. Once I got to know him better the more I fell for him.


I am by no means a talkative person, I have social anxiety and barely talk at all, add to that I've never really had real conversation in English with anyone before, so you can imagine my anxiety in my first Japanese class that I had. Fortunately we hit it off straight away since he mostly has the same interests that I have; travelling, backpacking, food, etc and he's the most overwhelmingly wholesome and positive person I've ever met too, so he had no trouble talking to me. I guess it's pertinent to mention that he's like that because he found Jesus in his life, and he often goes to one of those youth church gatherings where the pastor is oddly hot and all the people there is all smiles and lots of young music worshipping Jesus etc. It's actually what made him to be the person I fell for. On the other hand I'm this cynical atheist who don't really care about religion as long as you don't bother anyone. 

We made lots of unforgettable memories and new friends during our study; we went to lots of restaurants, Ryokans, onsens, all the essential things that you have to do in Japan you name it, we did just the two of us. Whenever there's a chance that I get to be with him I took it without a second thought. This one time on our Hokkaido trip we hiked this cool mountain and I can honestly say that that was the best thing that has ever happened to my life. 

Fast forward a couple of months near the end of his study, where he'll leave for his home country and I'm staying for a job, I decided one day to just tell him face to face that I have a crush on him or even more than that. He took it really well like I expected, you're still my friend and all that, but his reply was not as relaxed and as casual to his normal self and there's this hesitation and uncomfort that I see in his demeanor. After that talk, he and I became a little distant,  part of it is because that I didn't talk with him as casually like before, I'm embarrassed and still thinks that he's better off without me. Part of me still thinks that I've used him in a way, I won't lie I enjoy his company when it's just us two, maybe he would've rejected all my plans to travel alone if he knew what I am,that's why I didn't tell him.",25,71,0.9,AITA for not telling my best friend that I'm gay?,bb8pas,2019-04-09 14:38:13,NAH,2653,AITA

At one point she contacted my mother and brother without telling me to ask them about if I showed signs of it growing up. She wants me to get formally tested but upon looking into that's very difficult and expensive for an adult.

She joined a Facebook group for women with autistic boyfriends or husbands. The group seems to not act as a support group even if that's what it is in theory, but rather a place for women to vent about their autistic partners, or often just ex-partners of them venting about how awful they are. A lot of stuff she's shown me from it seems pretty bigoted, talking about how autistic people are basically sociopaths, how they can never understand emotions and never avoid from hurting people. She regularly shows me posts on it that ""remind her of me"" and sends me screenshots, often with her often hurtful comments about me intact. She asked on it if they thought I was on the spectrum and then showed me the responses. Her post was very one-sided in the description. The comments were very hurtful, most telling her to leave me, and about how I was obviously autistic and would never change. I told her how this hurts me and she just says that I need to address this even if it hurts because it could kill the relationship otherwise.

Whenever we discuss it we mostly go in circles. I pledge to change behaviors she dislikes and she shares stories from it as ""proof"" I might not be able to change and says it's important to talk about it because I need to be prepared if she decides to just walk away from the relationship as a result. I've actually gotten some books and resources to read about the issues with the relationship but sometimes don't get time to read them because we have a long drawn out conversation about something she read on there, usually a topic we've already discussed.

We once were having a discussion about boundaries. I asked if I could set some boundaries and one was not discussing that group with me. She got infuriated and went on a tirade against me, claiming my requests were ""rules, not boundaries"" and the only reason she shared that and other actions was ""a reaction to my bullshit"" so I had no right to complain about it, and how he she relies on that group for support because of my behavior so it's all ultimately my fault. She also regularly reminds me about how she might have to ""walk away from the relationship"" and how I shouldn't be bothered or offended if she does. I've told her that it's still a hurtful thing to constantly discuss if she wants to remain in it for now, which she insists she does, and is taxing on my emotional health and making it difficult to make the changes she wants.

Recently, we were inspired by a few lovely families in our neighbourhood to leave a box of (sanitised) toys and books for other children stuck at home in the lockdown because we understood how difficult it could be. An hour or two into our box being put outside, our neighbours had carried the entire box inside with them, including a few YA books with a 17+ description. We have felt this is extremely selfish, the children were in no way going to read or benefit from those books and we had planned for the toys to be shared to more than one family so everyone could benefit. The children have also been distressing my autistic brother and tricking him into throwing his own toys over the fence as they claim the toys are 'theirs', so I may be biased on the situation.

Said family has also left to go to the seaside during the strictest part of quarantine and invited several people from other households into their house without social distancing measures.

My mom asked me (25F) and my husband (30M) if we wanted to go boating this summer. Nice right? Well, the problem is that she and my dad become AWFUL to each other everytime we go. The lead up and prep starts with Dad getting stressed out and snapping, then Mom follows and it's a competition of who can make it worse. Usually the day itself goes...alright, but then it's time to load it back up and the same process repeats but 10X worse.

Anyways, on to the AITA. I work in customer service, so I was very careful and mindful with telling my mom that while we appreciate the offer, we probably wont go boating again due to the negative experiences we've had in the past.

We're happy to spend time with them doing other activities, just not boating.

19905,Not the A-hole,"My mother and I (32f) have at times had a relationship that was somewhere in the range of “it’s complicated” to “crashing on the rocks on fire”. It’s been getting better the last several years, but there’s still some stuff that‘s pretty broken.

My parents divorced when I was quite young & I never had any siblings, so it was just us two. We moved countries when I was 8. Mum got very stressed out/depressed, couldn’t take it out at work and bought it home instead. Until 21 I was her emotional punching bag & endured extensive emotional/verbal abuse accompanied and reinforced by things such as constant screaming, isolation/undercutting +  a hefty dose of gaslighting. She was always lovely in front of my friends, so they never believed me. She would tie all my good points to negative things (“How could someone so smart be so stupid” etc) in ways that still make it hard for me to have any faith in myself, etc

It was very confusing to unravel because she was all I had and in other ways she was great - she always went to bat for me, she went without a lot of things so I could have things like horse riding lessons and she was always very clear about loving me. Sometimes I think moving on & dealing would have been a lot easier if it had all been bad.

After I moved out Mum reached out to me to acknowledge what she’d done & apologised. This was a move she took on her own & it was and is clear that she feels really horrible and guilty about what happened & how she acted. I accepted her apology & we’ve slowly been making progress on getting things patched up. It does sometimes seem like she thinks that because she said sorry that should have fixed everything & I shouldn’t have mental health side effects anymore. Usually I just ignore it because I don’t want to get into it/explain.

The issue is that she keeps guilt tripping herself when we talk. We’ll be having a conversation and then she’ll get very maudlin & upset with herself and keep talking about what she did & how she screwed up/how she’s sorry etc. Until recently I’d reassure her it was okay & try to make her feel better but I’m finding that harder to do. I’m never the one to bring the topic up with her & frankly I’d rather it not be bought up at all.

I know she’s feeling guilty/upset and wants some reassurance but every time I tell her that it’s okay I feel like I’m telling myself that what happened was okay/validating it. If I don’t then the conversation ends up hanging really awkwardly & I get really anxious/Mum gets really upset. I don’t want to upset her but I don’t want to have to keep revisiting/reassuring her about it. I wish that she could move on/forgive herself but I can’t keep forgiving her over and over because that just keeps it fresher for me & makes me feel really vulnerable all over again.

Okay, background here: I've been dating this girl (Meg) since the start of February. We obviously haven't been able to really date much with stay-at-home in place, but we were able to go a on few dates and hangout some before everything hit. One of those times was at a party at her place. She lives with three other girls in a big house. I brought my best friend/roommate (James) with me since it was a big party.  James ended up hooking up with one of Meg's roommates (Liz). 

A couple months ago, Liz found out she was pregnant and said James was the dad. He's been freaking out, but trying to really be there and take responsibility. He's already changed a lot of plans he had for next year.with school and job stuff, and I know its caused a lot of fights with his family because they're really strict/hard on him anyway. (We're all in our early 20s. Me and James are both 23, Meg is 22. I don't know for sure how old Liz is, but she was in school with Meg, so i think also 22.) He and Liz didn't really know each other very well, so that's been awkward too.

So last week, I was on a video call with Meg, we've been having them a couple times a week to try and keep what we started going. Anyway, we were talking when Liz stopped by Meg's room. Liz didn't know Meg was on a call, i guess, and started talking to her about how stressed she was/what she was gonna do because she had to tell her ex that he's the dad of baby. 

I was pretty shocked. When Meg got back to the call she knew I'd head and asked me not to say anything to James. She said Liz wanted to talk to the baby's dad/her ex before she told James he wasn't the father after all. (I guess she really did think the dad was James at first, but the timing doesn't add up right for that. I'm not sure on the details.)

I agreed at first, but then a couple days later James was crazy stressed out about the baby and money and trying to make plans, and it felt wrong not to tell him. I let him know what I had heard. It led to a pretty big fight with him and Liz, and now Meg is mad at me. I get that she was trying to protect a friend, but I hardly know Liz, and James has been my best friend for since high school. I couldn't keep that from him, right?

I do feel bad that Meg is upset. I know her and Liz have been fighting about it too, which sucks. I didn't want that. I know Liz has been stressed being pregnant during a pandemic, too, and I'm sympathetic to that. I just feel like I had to look out for my friend.

I have her at my place every other weekend, and we try to have a family dinner together on Sundays if possible to try to establish a sense of normalcy for her. Here's the problem: Anna has been acting pretty inappropriate around me for the past couple of weeks. I'm talking drunk texts at 2 AM, kissing me on the forehead and cheek when we meet, insisting on hugging me, and repeatedly saying that she misses me in conversation. I don't know what spurred this on, but it's just strange.

The final straw was that, last Sunday, my daughter asked me why Anna and I were no longer married, and then said that she ""wishes you and mommy still loved each other so we could be a family together all the time."" Now, this could certainly be an innocent thought on her part, or (what I think is more likely) it could have been planted into her mind by Anna in some way. I talked to Anna about it later, and it quickly devolved into a weird fight. Something really set me off, I got really pissed, and yelled at Anna for what I thought was her inappropriate behavior. She ended up sobbing because she said that it was really hard for her to be a single mother, that she feels super depressed all the time, and that she wishes she could do anything to ""take back her what she did"", and that it's worth it for us to try again to be together because she loves me deep down and believes that I love her despite what's happened. She said that it was horrible of me to get angry with her when she was the one primarily raising our daughter and that she just wishes that things could be ""like they used to"".

That made me feel pretty guilty about yelling at her, because I definitely can't say that I've gotten over her fully. But at the same time, her actions definitely crossed a line given that we're no longer in any kind of relationship.

11175,Not the A-hole,"(Using a shared throwaway account)

I'm in my early 20's, and I was living with my father while I attended college. My father suddenly passed away in a car crash early last year, so I was suddenly weighed down with a lot of expenses. I couldn't afford to live there alone (I wasn't paying him rent, I was offering alternative methods of payment like cooking, cleaning, shopping for him, etc), and on top of that, he didn't have life insurance so I had to eat the funeral costs.

During the funeral my mom (dad's ex-wife, it was a nasty divorce) offered to let me live with her until I can get back on my feet, since I would have to put college on hold until I could earn some more $. I agreed and moved in.

I was unable to find work for nearly six months. During my stay their, I took care of all the household chores -- I did 100% of the cleaning, cooking, shopping, and other errands like going to the post office or calling for maintenance appointments. I also did both of our laundry and dry cleaning, and made her bed/tidied her bedroom every day. 

I had access to the guest bedroom, of which I was not allowed to decorate nor was I allowed to have friends over. My mother would frequently (daily) barge in and did not let me keep the door closed. She would often demand my attention at any moment to rant at me about various things for several hours long -- I had zero privacy and was essentially her handmaiden for several months. (My therapist used the word ""covert incest"" and ""narcissistic personality disorder"" to describe the situation. I was a surrogate husband). She used this time to frequently bad-mouth my father around me, even though I told her often that I was still going through the grieving process and didn't want to discuss him.

After awhile, I suddenly got a job and was able to move out on my own. My mom is now claiming I owe her rent for the time I lived there. We HAD discussed rent briefly before I moved in, but she never gave me a quote, and even when I tried to follow up, she never asked me for the money until after I left. There was no ""official"" agreement.

I told my friend while venting I had no intention of paying. She says I would be an asshole for not paying, but my logic here is, I was essentially paying my rent with my time and effort. Not to mention, yes I had a bed to stay in, but I didn't really have a room or any privacy.

The problem is, he works as a DJ, and part of his job description is partying into the early hours of the next day. 

By the end of his last gig, he’s cranky, sweaty, and in no condition to drive. 

Unfortunately for us, my job is in the startup field, and often involves late night projects, in which my teammates and I are also drinking a lot to keep morale up. 

The combination of a stressed out me and an overly critical version of my husband at 3am isn’t a good one.

Meanwhile, my daughter(16) recently got her driver’s license. So I asked that she drive him to his gigs and pick him up. Pretty simple task, especially since it’s summer and she’d be up anyway. 

Right away my husband told me she started complaining if she feels that he’s going to too many venues for one night or if he smells a certain way, or is telling her she’s driving too quickly. 

Last Friday I was away on a business trip and only got back this morning. The moment I walk in the door my daughter says she had to wait until 4am two nights in a row and that she was done.

My husband tells me my daughter was purposely driving unsteadily and calling him below the belt insults. 

So I go up to her room and remind her that our jobs provide her with her decent allowance and that we barely even ask her to do other chores.

When she said she’s not picking him up anymore, I ended up taking away her allowance.

Some background all my life it’s just been my mom, brother and I as my dad is shit and so is most of his family as well as my moms family. I am 23F and my brother is 19M and is honestly spoiled. My mom with me was strict I couldn’t go out with friends until I was like 17 nor could I just take her car whenever etc. Like if I talked back etc I’d get my ass beat but my brother? He got to be out till late and take her car whenever when he was only 15/16. 

We grew up somewhat poor not gonna lie but you best believe he had an Xbox iPod etc where’s I was lucky if I could convince her to let me get something nice. I had to work for all my shit where’s he got to sit on his ass eat and play Xbox all day. Anyway me and my mom do not get along at all (surprise surprise), I moved to a city 45 mins away and rarely talk to her or my brother. Before I moved he got this shitty Toyota Corolla from our step dad and my mom basically guilt tripped me/forced me to put his car under my insurance as well as under my name cause if he got insurance on his own or put it under his name it’d be hella expensive because he’s young etc. 

He has been on it for a year now & it’s been hell, I have to constantly remind him to pay me the $45 for his part or I literally have to threaten taking him off to pay me. I’m honestly getting tired of it, and recently I’ve found out he’s smoking weed which is whatever I do 2 but he’s being dumb about it. For example he’s always snap chatting him smoking or like the bag of weed or recently HIM SMOKING AND DRIVING AROUND. Oh and of course my mom doesn’t care nor says anything to him, but it’s one thing if he did it at home etc but now he’s risking my rate going up as well as me getting in trouble because the car is under my name!!!

After finding this out I told him that after this next month he is off my insurance I don’t care how much he whines or begs because I’ve had enough, I also told him he better have money ready to register the car in his name as I am taking my name off and cancelling the plates. Of course this did not go over well, he blew up my phone with calls and texts. Calling me a bitch, stuck up, that I must hate him, he doesn’t need me he’s grown, all the way to fake crying and begging me to please keep it in my name and the insurance because he doesn’t have money. But yet he’s got money for weed, going out to eat, going out with friends etc!?!? Yeah right.

8406,Not the A-hole,"I'm getting married in a couple weeks. It's going to be small, only 12 guests, so we're having dinner at a 5 star restaurant rather than having the event catered. I met with the restaurant manager a couple of months ago and explained that I was lactose intolerant. She assured me they could accommodate. A few days ago she emailed me the proposed menu for the 5 course meal everyone would be eating. Every item except one looks like it contains dairy.

&#x200B;

I asked if they'd be using dairy substitutes, and she told me no, they had a ""separate menu"" planned for me. I don't want to be an asshole or a bridezilla, but I am honestly baffled and annoyed. If they have to plan a separate menu anyway, why not just make the entire thing without dairy? Is it really easier to do two separate 5 course meals?

&#x200B;

For some context, I am not dairy free by choice, and I was not born this way. I developed the intolerance about 4 years ago. I am a foodie and I LOVE cheese, creamy sauces, ice cream, all things dairy.  The ""actual"" menu the restaurant manager sent me looks amazingly delicious, and I don't want to be staring enviously at what everyone else is eating. If it weren't my own wedding, I'd suck it up and be grateful someone accommodated my issue. However, this is going to be an expensive dinner and it's my own freakin' wedding! My fiancé is very supportive and has given up dairy with me except for the occasional pizza. Would I be a selfish bridezilla if I asked the restaurant to serve everyone this ""separate menu,"" whatever it is?

&#x200B;

Would I be an asshole for not letting my guests enjoy the dinner the restaurant has planned for them? Thank you for any feedback! I have not yet decided whether to make an issue out of this or just let it go.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I agree that I WBTA if I were restricting everyone from ordering what they wanted off the restaurant's normal menu. This is going to be a pre-set 5 course dinner. Salad, App., Entree, 2 desserts. Everyone has the same thing (but could opt out of one or two if they didn't like it). It's not going to be a normal catered wedding where you have 3 or 4 options.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Since people are asking, I don't know what the ""separate"" menu is. The restaurant manager hasn't emailed it (yet?). I think that's mainly why I'm upset. If this restaurant is as good as I've been told, the non-dairy menu should be great too, but it seems like they've focused all their energy on the ""main"" menu, so I don't know.",84,38,0.81,WIBTA if I asked that everyone at my wedding go dairy free?,cett36,2019-07-18 15:17:59,NTA,2496,WIBTA

5333,Not the A-hole,"Pretty much the title, I (19f) just moved out and told my mom some not so nice things. 

For a long time my mom was very depressed and thus a bit, absent. She was home quite often but didn't have the mental capacity to deal with anything besides her own problems, so I always had to deal with those myself. I could deal with that. 

The real problem was my brother. He had some real behavioural issues as well as some anger issues and often took it out on me. No matter what I did he wouldn't stop, and our mom didn't do anything to stop it. 

Some examples of things he did: steal money from my wallet, hide my keys/passport/schoolbooks, destroy or hide my belongings, mess with my room (pour soda on the bed, paint on the walls), listen to very loud music all night, cut big chunks out of my hair while I slept, etc. 

I was constantly stressed, I got a job working weekends when I was 15 just so i could afford a lock on my door to protect my belongings. He acted like this for years. 

I started college this year and moved out asap. My mom, who's been doing a bit better mentally, got very sad and asked me to promise to come over often and call every day. 

I told her that's not happening, that she pretended I didn't exist for years and that I don't want her to start now. I called her neglectful and selfish and left. 

That was two days ago, and since then my phone is blowing up with crying voicemails, angry or very depressed texts, plus texts from several family members calling me entitled and rude. 

I do feel bad, it was my brother causing all those problems, not her. But she's also our mom and I feel like she should have stepped in. But she was dealing with some serious mental shit. So AITA? 

Sidenote: my brother is two years older than me if that matters. The problems started when I was 13 and because less when I was 17, but they never quite disappeared.

Edit: I can't change the title, but I did tell her why. Sorry, brain fart. The family doesn't know why though, my mom hasn't told them.

Edit 2: I talked to my grandparents and one of my aunts and uncles about this situation. My grandparents where very dismissive pretty much told me to get over it, be an adult, and don't take it out on mom. My aunt and uncle where very shocked, they had no idea. They've been very sympathetic and are helping me look into options for therapy. 

Some people said I'm punishing my mom for being depressed, or that I resent her. I don't know if I do. I just want some space and maybe try to talk it out later.

6741,Not the A-hole,"Background I am the youngest of three kids. My two older brothers are both married. Jackson is married to Al and Peter is married to Karen (really). 

I am going through that phase all girls go through where they want to be a photographer but I've actually had some success. I shot a whole ton of graduation pictures, a few babies and did one wedding this summer. Enough for it to be a hobby that pays for itself and a little extra. 

Al approached me about doing a boudoir set with her for my brothers birthday. Once the skeeviness of giving my brother a boner passed I agreed. Al is not only gorgeous but she's tall, very athletic and very, very sweet. The pictures turned out amazing, a lot is looks but her energy just glowed on camera. Al is the centerpiece of the boudoir section on my website and because of her I am booked solid every weekend from now until Christmas. She wanted to pay me but I refused.

Last week I heard from Karen (that really is her name) and she said she's seen Al's pictures and wanted to know if I would do the same for her. I tried to be diplomatic and tell her that I would love to but I'm so booked up I can't even think about it until January. The reality is, Karen is very, very overweight and she doesn't take very good care of herself. She's also super high maintence and argumentative and I was dreading spending rime with her and having to explain why her pics didn't turn out like Al's.i think physical beauty can be found in people of all sizes but Karen is so hard to work with, I don't know if I can do it. 

Then it got even worse when I finally relented and said I would take a night off school in September and do the shoot and sent her a price list. That caused a huge melt down and she claimed I was being unfair and unfamily like because I didn't charge Al. I tried to explain that I was altering my schedule and actually I'm using Al's pictures for promotional material so it's a fair exchange. Karen said I could use hers for promotional material as well. I told her I was really sorry but if I'm going to take off school, I need to be paid.

Karen and Peter are on the warpath against me now. They left a bunch of nasty comments on my studio Facebook page which caused me to lose two weekend clients. They have spread rumors about me amongst other family and my cousin has decided to do her newborn shoot with another photographer. 

I called Karen and asked her to please cool it as she's having read world effects on me. She told me I brought this all on myself by being a ""piece of shit.""

13241,Not the A-hole,"Where to start,  


A couple months back, the Children's pastor at my church reached out to me asking if I would be interested in taking an internship opportunity this coming summer. It would be paid, I would get to go to all summer church functions for free (Mission trips, weekend retreats, etc.). All in all, it's a good deal. However I have my issues with the position, and I think they are valid opinions to have regarding it. 

1. I would be required to teach sunday school to kids - I'm not good with kids. Like, at all. I'm awkward, they're awkward, and to be honest I'm not confident enough in my knowledge of the Bible to be able to give these kids a decent lesson each and every sunday.
2. I already have a job, a job I LIKE - I work retail at an Adidas store, and I truly enjoy working there. My coworkers are awesome, my hours are flexible and reasonable, I get paid well enough for a 19y/o in college (something like $250-$300 per check). But working there PLUS having to intern 3-4 days a week makes me fear I won't have much free time to myself. 
3. I have personal issues with one of the people I potentially would be interning under. There's a lot of detail there, but to keep it short he's disingenuous, and he's got a major superiority complex.

Now that those are covered, I also want to acknowledge what my other plans would be for the summer if not that internship, which would be school and prepping for my upcoming classes. 

I want to major in CS, and I have a mentor that's been guiding me through my school and such. And with his guidance I really feel a desire to take some summer classes, and also do some independent studying on Python and Java that my fall classes will involve. 

My family does not like that idea. Whenever it's brought up they berate me about how 'invaluable' this will be for me on my resumes. How it will show that i'm willing to put others before me, etc. etc. (Ignoring the fact i've been on 7 mission trips through my church, which require more physical and mental sacrifice than teaching 4th graders about noah's ark on sunday morning.) 

And when I try to make my case, it will always boil down to this phrase: ""Please, do it for me!"". It's slowly becoming a phrase I despise, for reasons than just this.

14940,Not the A-hole,"Long time lurker here using a throwaway just in case. TL;DR at the bottom.

Background: I (24M) share a 2 bedroom apartment with a roommate (25F). We’ve lived together for more than a half year without any real issues until last night. We’re both single, and I have invited girls over to the apartment in the past and have given her a heads up nearly 100% of the time beforehand, while she doesn’t really date at all. Last night I had a date planned with a girl I met on Tinder.  I figured it was possible that she may come back to our place, so I warned my roommate. She let me know she would be downtown with her younger brother (18) seeing a concert, and that they would be back after midnight. She also said she was not comfortable with the girl being there while her brother was there, but that as long as the girl left before they came home then we were good. I asked her to text me when they were on their way to be safe, but that I would have the girl out by 11:30 if things went that way. So the girl and I met up for drinks, and the chemistry was there. I invited her back to my place, and we got there around 10:00. We go to my room and start up pretty quickly. 

Shit hits the fan: By around 10:30 we’re in a joint session of Congress, and I hear the front door open. I immediately stopped since the apartment was quiet, grabbed a Bluetooth speaker, put on some music, and got back at it. While putting on the music I noticed my roommate had texted me a warning, but it was 2 hours earlier than she said they would be back, and me and this girl weren’t anywhere close to done. So I made sure the music covered any noises, and spent the next hour getting several resolutions passed. We finish at 11:30, get dressed, and she’s out of the apartment at 11:35. After walking my date to her car, I checked my phone and see I got texts from my roommate, threatening to “Scream if she doesn’t leave” and ending with “IM SO FUCKING PISSED, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS”. 

AITA here? Should I have stopped on the spot just because they got home? Or am I justified because they got back earlier than expected? Would love some feedback here.

19806,No A-holes here,"Last week I(20F) had a dizzy spell and collapsed at home, all pale and a little purple(according to my mother). My vision went black for a moment and next thing I know I was on the floor and my lips hurt as I fell flat on my face. My head was spinning and it was as if I have forgotten how to breathe. I still had some conscious but was unable to get up on my own, so I  called for my brother next room for help.

&#x200B;

My sweet brother, after seeing me, decided to call my mother and run away, leaving me alone on the cold floor till she rushes back home and dragged me to her car all by herself. She is a small woman you know, and it took her quite an effort as I could not quite help myself. She drove me to the hospital and soon I recovered on my own without much assistance. I still took some tests and booked further appointments in future to see what is wrong with me. Got to say that experience was really scary as I thought that I was going to die, it never happened to me before to feel so helpless and weak. 

&#x200B;

Since then I have been quite distant with my brother, ignoring him most of the time when he talked to me. He knows that I am mad at him and explained that he thought I got the... 2019 virus and he did not want to get infected(results came back negative by the way). I just scoffed, rolled my eyes and continued to ignore him.

180,Not the A-hole,"My dad doesn’t help at home. When my mom goes out to buy goods in the wet market, he stays in the car and complains whenever my mom takes too long to shop in the wet market.

We asked him to sort out a box of his things. He got mad and said that we shouldn’t meddle and we should just mind our own things. 

It’s been months since we moved to our current house and his things are a mess, they’re all piled up at the back of the house. We asked him to sort it out since mice are starting to live in the box and since he has a lot of time now, there’s no excuse for him to avoid that chore.


Yesterday, my mom bought some sacks of rice. My dad didn’t even go with her to buy it because he was sleepy, even though I told him to just sleep in the car just so my mom would have a companion during the trip. I wanted to go with her however, I’m working from home and can’t just leave my computer.

When she got home, my brother was the only one carrying them into the house. I can’t carry heavy things because I have scoliosis.

I told my dad to help his son. He said that I was being too much on him, he said he’s disabled and I’m ordering him to carry sacks of heavy rice. He asked me if I thought he was normal — i honestly didn’t consider his disability because I think he’s doing fine, especially since he’s smoking AGAIN even after the doctor told him not to. I wanted to tell him that for a disabled person, he sure does smoke a lot. 

To clear things out, he got a heart attach 6 years ago and had to go under angioplasty, causing him to be a person with a disability.

Anyway, I told him he could help my brother by holding one end of the sack instead just so that my brother wouldn’t literally get all of the heavy load.

He then proceeded to carry one sack of rice on his own because my brother did the rest. After that, he swept the floor and kept saying I was being too much, esp. since he’s disabled and I’m telling him to go carry heavy stuff.

My mom told me that I was being mean, especially how I told on him. I told her that I was telling the truth because he doesn’t even help at home. She didn’t disagree, however she said the way I spoke to him was wrong, I made him feel useless because he doesn’t have the job right now and the way I snapped at him made him feel more useless.

She asked me to apologize, which I refuse to do because I don’t think I did anything wrong. I just got sick of how it’s always the 3 of us who does stuff in the house and he just slacks off when he has a lot of time to do things.

16647,Not the A-hole,"About a year ago, I met a woman at a party and we hit it off. In fact, we slept together on the night we met. In the course of this, I discovered that she was significantly younger than me (she's 19, I'm 35).

Some time after we met, she reached out to me on social media, wanted to meet again in a more dating context. I was reluctant for two reasons: first, I was fairly sure she had a boyfriend by then and, two, I wasn't entirely comfortable with our age difference. She assured me that she didn't have a boyfriend and, over time and a number of conversations, I came to believe that our age difference wouldn't be an issue. 

Finally, I agreed to meet, and offered a time and place. She declined, so I offered another time and place. We went back forth like that for a bit until she finally simply ghosted me. I felt a bit like a dumbass, and was a bit butthurt, but I dismissed it and moved on.

A little bit later, I saw some posts on social media from her that made it clear that she *did* have a boyfriend, and had at the time we were talking about getting together. I considered the whole thing a bullet dodged.

Recently, in the last month or two, she's been posting on social media again, but now she's describing her recovery from drugs (which is news to me, I didn't even realize she was an addict.) She's also talking about how lonely she is, how sorry she is that she burned so many bridges, and how she wishes some of her friends would be willing to re-connect now that she's clean.

This woman sounds like ten pounds of trouble in a five-pound bag, and I really don't want to get dragged into any of it. But a good friend of mine (whose advice I typically trust) said that I was being too mean and that I should reach out to her and at least be friends.

So, am I the asshole for not wanting to get involved with this woman and all of her drama?

3073,Asshole,"
I’m a young (22M) guy who loves to dance and go clubbing. At these clubs and dance floors, they get really loud and crowded and frequently you have to “lightly” push your way through to get through the crowd. 

When I’m trying to get through women, I generally put my hand on the small of their back and push from there. I do this because I feel like its gives me good leverage to get them out of my way and quickly and as smoothly as possible. I stay well clear of the girl’s ass and never have my hand there longer than I need to. If the girl is wearing a crop top or something where I would be touching her skin, than I try to put my hand higher if there’s fabric cuz I’m not trying to touch some stranger’s bare back. 

I would do this to men too honestly, however I’m bi and live in a conservative area and am extra paranoid about provoking a guy into a fight cuz he thought I was hitting on him. So I usually push them with my forearm and a much more aggressive to get through. 

Recently I was talking about this and a good friend of mine, told me that this was shitty of me and that girl’s don’t like being touched there at all. I have seen myself as benign cuz I’m just putting hand there to move them, and I’m not trying to “cop a feel”, I’m just trying  get to dance.

20444,Not the A-hole,"This happened over the holidays, but some members of my family are still upset about this and I thought I'd post here to ask. 

I (25F) am currently halfway through a PhD in Composition and Cultural Rhetoric. My B.A. is in English and my M.A. is English Studies with a focus in Rhetoric & Composition. My cousin (28F) is currently doing freelance PR and social media work and runs a blog on the side. Her B.A. was in PR.

This winter break, we had a few different family gatherings. At the first, an aunt asked me how school was going. I mentioned that after I get feedback on my final papers, I wanted to submit one to a journal so I can hopefully start getting some publications to my name. My cousin said she'd be ""happy to let me have a guest post or two on her blog."" I declined, saying that I needed to focus on academic publishing. She said ""you know, my blog isn't some little thing, I have thousands of followers."" I said I knew that, but that academic publishing is an entirely different thing, and there is no place for a blog post on my C.V. She was annoyed, but we let the conversation rest after that. 

About a week later, I had my feedback and was working on revisions so I could start sending stuff out. One prof had sent back my paper saying it was ready to send out after a few revisions. My cousin mentioned wanting to read it after I described it at the previous gathering, so I sent it to her. At our family Christmas party, she came up to me, saying she had finished reading and had some comments. Her main comment was that I should download an app that rates the ""reading level"" of any piece of writing. She said that ""according to research,"" most people will not read anything beyond an 8th grade reading level, and that if I want to get this published, I'd need to rewrite it to fit that standard. At this point, I was pretty annoyed but to keep the peace on Christmas I said that I was sticking to my prof's feedback. She kept pushing the issue saying that she has tested this theory on her blog and it was true, etc. I finally snapped a bit and said that she has no idea how academic publishing works, that I have two, almost three degrees that focus on writing, and that if my prof with over 25 years of experience in the field says it's ready to go out, I'm trusting that over someone with no experience in academia. 

This has caused a split in the family between people who think I was just finally drawing a boundary, and people who think that I was being pretentious, that I think I'm better than her, and that I was unnecessarily rude.

He got mad at me cus I told him I would help install it but he has made no effort to get a toilet or anything to help the situation.

2498,Not the A-hole,"I've (29F) been friends with my roommate (25F) for years, she starting dating bf (25M) in Spring.  He's ok and everything but she is VERY back and forth with him and he acts like a brat.  He's lived at home all his adult life, never tried to move out and my roommate and myself have for the most part been totally independent since high school ended.  We moved in together a few months ago. 

Obviously bf is over a lot, like all his free time.  He bought HER groceries once and said I wasn't allowed to eat them.  He has contributed nothing else.  Roommate has told me she plans to get him a spare key.  He doesn't stay the night often but is over all the time whether I like it or not.  Like I said, he's not a bad guy, he just strikes nerves..frequently.  

The other night, roommate was out most of the night and bf tried to come over and just crash for a while until she got back.  And then obviously hang out with her for probably the rest of the night.  He lives in same town, he just didn't want to go home.  It wasn't clear how long she'd be out for.  I'll be honest, I simply didn't want him in my house if she's not even going to be here.  Heaven forbid he accidentally eat MY food (r/sarcasm).  It'd be different if he did anything for the house but I clean the place and offer him anything I cook (petty-like).  So I told him I didn't want him there if she was out and wouldn't let him in.  

Now they are both calling me an asshole because in their mind he wasn't bothering me, he'd be in her room.  Personally, I like to walk around naked to and from the bathroom if I need to, walk around with no pants on, not wear a bra whatever; and if he's walking from her room to the kitchen or outside to smoke he's ganna see me.

My partner doesn't work but staying by his side is *my* choice, I dont need my family judging me especially when she doesn't have bills.

4384,No A-holes here,"So our next door neighbour has 7(!) Cars. He keeps 4 in his drive/garage and the others on the road. He's constantly blocking our drive and has bumped our cars 10+ times. 

I always refer to him as ""the blind man"" and so do the rest of our flat mates. The reason is because one of the HUGE vans he leaves in the road is for his blind fitting business. 

So, my roommate is getting pissed that he keeps blocking her in and bumping the car. I told her to go to his house and speak to him and she went ""well I can't really say anything, it's not his fault if he's blind"" and then she went on a rant about how is he allowed to drive if he's blind? No wonder he's always wearing sunglasses, etc. 

Anyway, the other day I came outside to find her helping the man across the street. Like, she was holding his hand and the man looked utterly confused. 

Then, the next day The Blind Man reversed into her car with his van and she went outside. I went with her and she confronted the guy politely saying ""look, I know it's hard for you being blind and all but I can't afford to keep having my car bumped, you've ripped the plate off"", the man, again confused, apologised. He says, ""I'm not blind"" and she glared at me. She asks what he said and he says again that he's not blind. As she glared at me again, I pointed at his van - advertising his Venetian blinds. The cogs are turning, she apologised to him profusely and then comes inside. Screams at me saying that the past few weeks she's been helping him cross the street, helping him reverse and generally patronising him. She can't believe I never corrected her.

9040,Not the A-hole,"My parents had two children before me.  They only wanted two children (an ""ideal family with a boy and girl""), but they became pregnant with me unexpectedly.

&#x200B;

The story my mom told several times was that she was scheduled for a tubal ligation (this was in 1975), but arrived at the appointment certain that she was already pregnant (with me). She claims she told medical staff who was prepping the tubal that she ""swears she's pregnant."" According to my mom, a nurse or doctor (don't recall which) said so non-nonchalantly that they ""can just abort it at the time of the tubal.""  My gut feeling is that she wants to be remembered as a hero who saved my life. I have serious doubts about that.

&#x200B;

First of all, I think if she felt she was pregnant and wanted to keep me, why not cancel the appointment before? Second, if she waited until the appointment, why would someone automatically assume that she would want an abortion, at that moment, despite going in for a tubal ligation?  Third, couldn't she have gone ahead with the tubal even though she was pregnant?

&#x200B;

After some serious thought digging and putting clues together, I believe my dad coerced my mom to get an abortion, but at the last second, she chickened out.

&#x200B;

Here's my evidence:

\-My mom frequently told me on my birthday and sometimes on Christmas that I was a ""mistake"" and ""accident"" and never a ""surprise."" She also lamented how my parents had to get a bigger house, car, more furniture, food, etc. because of my existence.

\-My dad told me several times that the family was great until ""\[I\] came along.""

&#x200B;

\-He did the bare minimum of being a father to me: food, clothing, shelter, etc.

&#x200B;

\-I was often criticized for upsetting my special needs older sister, when I did absolutely nothing to her.

&#x200B;

There are many other things I could post here, but for my own sanity, I'm wondering if IATA for confronting them? They are big on keeping up appearances, so they could lie and/or be so angry that I would suggest/bring up such a thing. Or simply not even remember.

so I went in at 8:30am cst this morning and took a muscle relaxer as soon as I parked, hoping it would help take the edge off. well it didn’t (big surprise for someone who has chronic pain regularly) so around 12:30, I took 50mg of tramadol. I’m not a small person so even this small dose doesn’t really help all that much more than the muscle relaxer does. 

one thing led to another and my boss ended up learning this information. she then proceeded to tell me that I “couldn’t be at work on prescription pain medicine” and that it made her “uncomfortable” and “why would you take the medicine if it doesn’t even help, next time just ask and I’ll give you some ibuprofen”.....

keep in mind, I work in an office behind a computer, not a forklift or “heavy machinery”. I’m not abusing the drug and it barely effects me. (does she seriously think ibuprofen is gonna do anything?) I’m getting my work done so I don’t have a pile of work waiting for me once I’m feeling better and can come back full time. who knows when that will be so I feel that I’m doing this for the benefit of the department.

it made me upset the way she was condescending like that and especially in front of all my coworkers. so I ended up barely saying goodbye and just leaving in tears; from pain, yes, but also embarrassment.

15440,Asshole,"Background info: our household is me, my husband, our two teenage daughters and my parents. Due to my mom and dad living with us all of our meals are rather traditional as my dad won’t touch anything else.


My daughters are not really into the meals we make so my eldest decided to pretty much cook for herself. She will occasionally eat with us, but most of the time she buys stuff with her money and eats whatever she likes. 


I don’t exactly like it, but anytime we tried forcing her to eat our food she’d throw a fit so I gave up. 


Issue:


I was planning to cook with use of ground meat today but realized I forgot to buy it. However, there was some meat apparently bought by my daughter. I took it and cooked a meal that I know she likes and also that the rest of family likes.


However, when she came home and realized I used it she got really irritated with me. She asked me if I took it and I said that yes I did, but I cooked something she’d enjoy. She said that it didn’t matter what I cooked because she had a “meal prep” in mind and now she can’t. 


I have to say that I felt a little offended by her making a fuss about it so I told her to just quit complaining about it and “meal prep” something else. 


She blew up then and told me that I need to pay her back for the meat I used. I laughed because it’s ridiculous, the meat she bought costed pennies and it’s not like I ask her to pay back for the food I buy to feed the family, right? 


She then told me that this is exactly why her and her sister don’t like me and that unless I pay back she won’t speak to me. 


My husband heard everything so I asked him to discipline her, but he said that he’s on her side as she paid for it herself and I’m not only an asshole to use her stuff, but also an asshole because now he will have to pay back money I “owe” to her so she doesn’t feel hurt by my “unfairness”. 


As of now no-one except for my parents speaks to me. Am I insane to think she overreacted and made me look like some kind of villain? Or am I the asshole here?

8466,Not the A-hole,"Buckle up buckaroos, it's going to be a long one.

So I'm the only person in my friend group who has a car. We all live together and go to the same university. I always ask my friends if they want to go to the supermarket with me, or to grab lunch or go to the university with me, and I drive us without asking anything in return.

If we go out to party, I have to drive us. So I always have to stay sober (or moderately sober) and I risk the chance of getting pulled over. This bothers me, but so be it.

Last semester my parents stopped paying for my gas and I had to start using my own money. I continued to let my friends drive with me for free, because I'm going to the same place anyway so it wouldn't cost me more, even though it would be nice if they sometimes offered to pay for gas since they get lifts for free like every day, but that's still fine.

Fast forward to today. We decided ahead of time to go for burgers tonight. After we all got back from class, I was supposed to take the 4 of us to the restaurant. My one friend wasn't home when we were supposed to leave. I messaged him and asked if he was still going with us, and he said that he was at another friend's house. He told me to come pick him up. This house was completely in the other direction than the restaurant, and far as well. Gas prices just went up, and I just started paying for my own gas. So I said that I really couldn't afford to come pick him up, and that he should ask the guy whose house he was at to drop him off and that we'll wait. The guy refused.

He (my friend) says I'm very selfish and childish for not wanting to pick him up. He still didn't offer to pay for the gas it would take to pick him up. We got in a huge argument and eventually I just went and picked him up since the other guys wanted to go eat already. He didn't pay any gas money, or buy me a drink or anything. So I graduated from letting my friends tag along on rides to the same place I'm going, to literally just driving them around. 

This friend also asked me to take him to the hospital to see his mom one night at 10pm, this is obviously different and I was happy to take him. It's just that I would personally buy someone a chocolate or drink to say thanks for that, but this guy didn't even say thank you with words. 

I feel like if I'm the one to always drive, the other people should maybe just offer to once in a while pay for gas or buy me a drink or something. It gets really expensive.

Anyway, my flatmate of 18months left the country to go home before covid and has now declined to return so I had to find a new flatmate. The girl that I found seemed nice, a bit weird in the typical hippy vegan way but didn't gave a problem with living with someone who eats bacon and i was having trouble finding potential flatmates and can't afford the apartment by myself. 

We agreed to a 6 week trial before she would've signed on for a year. 

Initially everything seemed fine but in the 3rd week I noticed that my anti depressants were occasionally not in the cabinet in the mirning when I woke up(I always take them at 8am before work). Often I would briefly look for them but have to rush out of the house before I could find them. They would usually be back that evening or I'd find them in the other bathroom cabinet or in the vanity next to the toilet. I asked her if she was moving them a couple of times and the first time she said no and the second she said that she was trying to find her health vitamins and had emptied the cabinets looking for them and must have forgotten to put my anti depressants back. I thought this was weird cause nothing else had moved but shrugged it off. 

In the 4th week I couldn't find them for 3 days, confronted her and she offered to help search only for her to ""find"" them in the kitchen cabinets and blamed it on me taking them into the kitchen(I never do). Beginning of the 5th week I couldn't find them again and while I was searching the apartment I saw her open bag and looked inside(yes I know im TA here), low and behold there were my pills. I confronted her that evening and she said she was trying to wean me off them and that I should stop putting that poison in my body. I told her that it wasn't going to work out and to find somewhere else to live. She threw a hissy fit and packed all her stuff that night and left(to be clear I did say she had until the end of the trial period to leave, she didn't have to go immediately).

I told them my son had asked for the adult meal, but they said he should have had the kid's meal because he's under eighteen. They said I should have known he was meant to have a kid's meal and that I should have asked for clarification if I wasn't sure. But I wasn't unsure, I never thought for a second that my son would have a kid's meal.

I have been dating a new woman for about 8 months and things are going well.  During custody exchange this week, my ex (we are very civil for my daughter, even though we basically can't stand each other), gave me back some Halloween decorations she took when she moved out 2.5 years ago.  She said ""I'm not gonna use these, do you want them?"" I said yes.  I said yes because these were mine before, they aren't bad looking, and I'm a dude so I don't have an excess of decorations.

My gf saw she gave me these decorations during the exchange. 

Later we carved pumpkins (me, daughter, gf) and I put the decorations out with the pumpkins.

My gf got quiet and had her sad face on and later when we were in bed I asked her what was wrong and she told me she hated the fucking decorations and resents that many of my possessions are associated to my ex. I said the decorations are fine, they don't have my ex's name or a picture of her and she wouldnt have known they were associated to her unless she saw them come from my ex.  My gf is still very adamant about hating the decorations and got a tad bit dramatic when I suggested that her feelings were petty and a bit immature. I told her I have lots of property that used to belong to both of us, car, oven, house, bed etc

In the end, I called and informed her I put the decorations away and she won't see them.... but I also told her it was because I don't want to see her upset even though I think her reasoning for being upset is ridiculous.

12754,Not the A-hole,"I forgot this week was mother's day. It was around  3 days before when I found out and my weekend had started. I was getting back into playing Rust and I would not stop playing like the typical 14 year old boy I am. The night before I stood up all night, something I hadn't done since I was 6, playing. My mom woke up at her usual 5 AM time and found out I was playing,  which she got pissed because I hadn't done my homework.

I never got her a present. I didn't get her a card, etc. I completely understand that my actions are really asshole-ish, and I take full responsibility for that. BUT, the way my mom had responded has made me lose all my will.

My parents got divorced when I was 3. My mom has been pissed at my dad ever since I came back to my home country 2 years ago. She's been saying how he's never supported me or been there  for me, that he doesn't do anything for this family. I hate this about  my mom because my dad is now married and his financial situation as a  graphic designer is not ideal. My mom doesn't work and all her money comes from my great grandfather's trust

I hold my mom's opinion in the highest regard. Whatever she says is what I believe. During the car ride to my  grandmothers' we were picking up my mom's best friend. Before we got there she started to tell me that she doesn't want me to be with  her anymore. She wanted to send me to a camp which I was severely bullied at and no longer wish to go there. She wanted to send me to a boarding/military school in the US, so she didn't have to deal with me.  She wanted me to go live with my dad so I wasn't bothering her. When I told her I was being bullied at that camp, she laughed in my face and said ""You're bullying ME."". She clearly got her point across: She wished I wasn't there and possibly even born. I started crying, because when your mom tells you she doesn't want you, I don't know what else to do. She, again, laughed at me and said ""Keep crying, that's all you ever do"". When my godmother (Mom's best friend) got in the car she asked why I was crying. My mom lied and said ""He didn't do anything for me today  and didn't even do his homework, so he's being a crybaby"".

When she does things like this and tries to guilt trip me, I usually close myself and don't talk. I just don't reply to anything because I cry  and I just want to not be bothered.  So when we got to my grandparents' house, she told  everyone the same story. ""He didn't even MAKE A CARD for me. He didn't do his homework, and he's just been a crybaby, isn't that right, OP?"" I only started smiling when I came inside my grandfather's library and started watching John Wick with him. When we got home, she said  that she wasn't going to take care of me anymore. I was thinking of making her a card during the day, but this whole ordeal  has made me extremely saddened.

I stood outside the storage closet and waited and heard a loud shush noise. Then after about 15 seconds there was another loud ""SHHHH"" from the storage closet. It was unmistakable human noise, not the wind or anything like that. I was concerned that it might be getting robbed so I knocked on my neighbors door to see if she had anyone in there cleaning or looking for stuff as I heard rustling and shushing from her storage closet. She was a little short with me and snapped that there was no one in there and closed the door. I gotta admit the whole situation had my imagination running. Like if there was someone being held against their will in there. So I called the non-emergency police number and told them what I heard. They sent out two officers and asked my neighbor to open the closet.

This is basically exactly what the title says. My twin sister is childfree. And I don't just mean in the ""doesn't have kids, doesn't want them"" kind of way. I mean in the ""actively hates children, uniromically refers to parents as ""breeders"" with a tone of disgust"" kind of way.  I honestly don't know *why* she hates kids so much, but she does and that's her prerogative. I'm the polar opposite. I think kids are awesome and I have a daughter of my own who is 6. I'm split up from her mother, but we're still very good friends and co parent very amicably.  

My sister has nothing to do with my daughter. She will talk to her at family events if other people are around, but will not see her alone. It's to the point where she'll only come visit me if my daughter is a) at her mum's or b) in bed, so she doesn't have to be around her. Again, this is her prerogative and it seemingly works for her, so whatever. However, the issue lies in the fact that, even though she has nothing to do with my kid herself, she seems to feel she's entitled to comment on my parenting. Some examples of this; I still let my daughter sleep in my bed if she's feeling sick or has a nightmare, and my sister says this is bad parenting and will stunt her emotionally; I got my daughter a tablet for Christmas last year and generally let her sit and play with it for an hour or two a day while I do housework or uni coursework or whatever, sister says I'm rotting her brain; I asked our mum to babysit overnight so I could go to a friend's birthday do a couple of weeks ago, sister called me an irresponsible and reckless parent. The latter was what broke the camel's back, and I snapped at her, telling her since she has an aversion to children she can't comment on my parenting. (Edit: just wanna say this is not by any means a comprehensive list but I'm conscious of character limit, so pulled a few examples. Can go more in depth with this in comments if you like). 

She got pretty outraged at that and told me that I'm being disrespectful and that, just because she doesn't have kids, doesn't mean she's an idiot and doesn't know basic things. She ended up in tears because she felt like I was insulting her intelligence. That wasn't my intention, of course, I'm just fed up with her simultaneously hating my child and also trying to tell me how to raise her.

13661,Not the A-hole,"(I posted this to r/advice and I’m posting it here too.) 

Last week, our school held its annual prom and one of my friends went with all of his friends. Before prom, almost all of the couples or groups  take a lot of pictures, and my friend and his group decided to take pictures at our local botanical garden. 

After taking pictures, he and his friends destroyed a fence of bamboo and pulled out a Japanese maple and arranged the bamboo in a pentagon. I know this because he arrogantly bragged about it to me at school two days after prom. 

Yesterday while looking in the local newspaper in the police and fire section, a big box saying “Botanical garden vandalized” took most of the section up. It said that a $500 reward will be given leading to the arrest of the vandals. 


This particular friend isn’t really a good role model. He is a big weed/juul dealer at our school and he’s been caught 3 times. After each time getting caught he always said, “Don’t worry guys, I’ll change.” Every time he said that, two days later he would post on his snapchat story saying “hmu if you want some pods tomorrow”.


I really want to turn him in to teach him a lesson and get a free $500, but I’m a minor and I’m not really comfortable dealing with the police. Plus, if my friend finds out I reported him, he will surely never forgive me. He also hangs out with some sketchy people which makes me more uncomfortable. I just think he needs to learn his lesson because he hasn’t changed himself in the past few months.

Ive been working at a food establishment that is called, let's say Hizza Put as a shift manager for about two years now. 

On Sunday night around 10:45pm
(Closing time is at 11pm) a Native family of about 11 people come in and ask if we are open and tell me they want to dine in.  Now we dont have an official closing time for our dining area but my boss says to ""Use your descresion"" so given that it takes about 12 minutes for me to make these pizzas and get them out of the oven I let them know that I can't seat them but I can make their order to go. They agree and I put the order in the oven.

     Everything would be fine if that is all that happened. Now as those pizzas were in the oven two caucasian men came in around 10:57 and ordered a carryout pizza (A little annoying but whatever, ita just a carryout). One chatted with me for a bit before I went and made their order. After putting their order in the oven they asked me for drinks while they waited so I gave them each a soda. Native family's pizzas come out, I give them their order they leave (11:01ish). Now the two mens pizza comes out (11:12ish) I give it to them in a box and go back to finish up on dishes. 

      I finish dishes and realize the two men are still sitting and chatting and drinking their sodas in the store. I realize they must not know we are closed but I forgot to tell them and I hate confrontation and kicking people out so I decide to mop the floors and then if they're not gone I would let them know they have to leave. I finish the floor. Let them know that it is now 11:25 and they will have to go home. They apologize and express that they thought we closed at 12pm. They take their stuff and leave. 

     Now, somewhere in the time this happened one of the Native family members that had left drove by and saw that these two men were still in the store and got very very angry I didnt seat their family, called me a racist and is currently trying to get me fired.

He went into a rant about regrets and that you want to get tattoos when you’re in your 40s and have permanent hobbies/interests (which I fully agree with). She snarkily replied that taking 45 years to get a cross on your arm really sounds like it took a lot of thought (he has a cross on his arm and it’s his only tattoo).      
        
I told her to cool it, and that she’s ignorant to bash his cross tattoo when her flowers and butterflies and cursive won’t withstand 45 years of changes either. She started to cry and asked why I even dated her if I had such an issue with tattoos and her dad tried to tell her she needed to calm down but she stormed off and told me she’d venmo me money for an Uber home but that she was going home alone right now.

13827,Not the A-hole,"Don't worry people, I am not a child abuser. Let's get that out of the way. Also, on mobile, throwaway, etc. 

My son (12)  has always been smart and done well in school, until this year. He started middle school and his grades went to shit. He failed English the first term (maybe relevant, I am an English teacher). He just hadn't been turning in reading logs despite reading every day.  When this occurred, we took away his video game privileges, and I started more closely monitoring his homework and grades via an app. He worked to bring his English grade up, and he got a Switch for xmas. 

Things seemed to be going well so I got lax about checking his homework. Then he failed science and got a D in math. Dude wants to be an ecologist.  So I went a bit nuclear and declared an indefinite moratorium on screens. He is only allowed to use his phone to text family, and he only gets tv if we are watching a family movie. No video games at all. He has to bring both grades up to at least a B to get screen time restored. If he doesn't do that by the end of the year, the moratorium will continue all summer. I have been firm about this. 

Now I am starting to feel guilty. The rest of the family has a game or show they're into, so there are times where we all are having screen time and he has nothing to do. He reads, builds with legos, and we play board games, but he's getting bored. It's finally warming up, so I have let him ride bikes with friends. And he goes to an after school program where he sees friends as well. So he's not completely isolated. But still, maybe a simple ""you're grounded for a month"" would do?

3571,Not the A-hole,"I was at work, it was 1:00, and my son called me and said ""your never gonna believe what happened to me"" and then said he was in the hospital because he broke his pinky finger by getting a door slammed on it. He was VERY casual about it, he was joking on the phone, he said it wasn't that bad and that mom was coming to the hospital soon. He sent me a photo of his finger in a cast/splint, it looked a bit bruised but it wasn't a super serious break. I had broken two of my toes when I was 24 and it was very painful when it happened, but once it was fixed up it wasn't so terrible. I told him I would pick up his prescription on the way home from work at 5:30, and he said it was fine, and that they were gonna get it. So he had known I was coming home from work, we made that clear. He sounded absolutely fine with it. I didn't think this was a major deal at all. I mean, it would be to an extent in that he had a broken finger, but not a massive deal. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, my wife calls me and is absolutely furious that I would stay at work when our son was in the hospital with a broken bone (she kept on emphasizing 'broken BONE' almost to make it more serious than it was... a broken finger is not exactly as bad as a broken arm or leg). She was yelling at me to the point where I could barely even get a word in. I honestly got a tiny bit upset at her because sometimes she does this thing where she gets upset and talks so fast that you can't get a single word in, and eventually I just told her goodbye and hung up. We continued the conversation through text. For one, I couldn't leave work, I had an important meeting at 4:30. Two... its a broken finger. He was apparently mostly ready to leave home soon after my wife got there. We don't often fight, its been 19 years of a good marriage, but sometimes when it comes to medical issues especially she can get very upset. I kind of expected that from her, and we fought again later in the night but eventually dropped it. 

&#x200B;

A week later at dinner (and by the way, my son is absolutely fine, luckily it was not his right hand finger), she brings it up to my cousin and brother and their family (half joking-half accusation, kind of like a ""can you believe this guy"" thing) and it seemed like basically everyone at the table sided with her.

2943,Not the A-hole,"My fiance and I have been planning our wedding for the better part of a year now and we get married in 3 weeks. We had a limited budget so we picked a small inn in the mountains with a wedding package within our budget that limits our guest list to 18 people. She and I both aren't crazy about kids and with the limited guest capacity we have asked her sister, her brother, and my brother to please leave their children with someone at home so that we may accommodate our closest relatives but also have a child free, low(er) stress wedding weekend. 

I spoke to my brother a year ago when we started planning and he said 'no worries.' When it came time to book rooms, my mother booked an on site cottage so that the children could stay there since the inn doesn't allow children under 10 on the premises (didn't know that when we booked the place for the ceremony.) I caught wind of it and went to my brother who again said no worries, kids will stay home. A few months back I checked in with him again, he still tells me they're staying at home. A couple weeks ago my grandmother starts taking about how excited she is about the wedding and to have niece and nephew there with us. I once again go to my brother who confirms the kids are staying with his sister in law and her wife. 

This past weekend we had a house warming party and my mom mentioned the kids being there again. At this point I'm over it. I called her today and put it as plainly as I could that we have been asking for a year that no one bring children to our wedding. She says she'll call my brother and ""run interference"" but to just let it go, they'll do what they want. I say again that it's not what they want, it's our wedding weekend and we've been planning it a certain way, for certain reasons. Mom says that brother and wife may just not come (brother is my best man btw.)

Mom is paying part of the wedding expenses but we have the money and originally planned to pay the whole thing ourselves. To some people that will matter in their judgement of the situation.

Are we justified in being pissed off or should we suck it up and deal?

*****
Edit for info: The inn is a 90 minute drive from home for my family. Her family is coming from Florida, Virginia, Mississippi, and further away in our home state. 

A bride/groom-zilla comment was made and it occurred to me that I left out my future MIL will 100% make a scene if my brother brings his kids while her people left theirs at home for 2 nights. Yes we want things our way but we also don't want to deal with anyone's shit.

Edit for clarity: A lot of people are calling me out for not letting the kids stay off site. The cottage is literally 200 ft from the inn. 

It was also suggested that I add the concern of the kids being snuck into the service and reception. If they are there, it will happen. I know my grandmother and she wouldn't hesitate.",210,608,0.96,AITA for not wanting my niece and nephew at my wedding?,dd92i7,2019-10-04 15:41:17,NTA,2887,AITA
20219,Asshole,"I was looking to buy a car from a dealership and the salesperson that happened to see me first was a very attractive woman that also happened to dress a bit provocatively. Not unprofessionally, but I personally considered it too much.

I generally don't do well with people who are so attractive, they make me very uncomfortable, but I decided to give her a chance. I told her what I was looking for and she showed me some models they had available. This whole thing took about 20 minutes until I decided that this wasn't a person with whom I wanted to negotiate to buy a car. So I asked her if it was possible to see someone else to help me.

She said that she was working on commission and asked for the reason.

I told her that I could understand that and apologized for wasting her time. I didn't really want to tell her the real reason why I was asking for the change, so I chose not to answer her question.

She said that it's no problem, but that she, as a professional, would like to know what she did so as to avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.

I could see no way out and it was a fair request, so I told her as politely as I could: she was too attractive, dressed too revealingly and that made me uncomfortable with her. 

I could see that annoyed her, but she chose to take it in stride and said she'll ""take that as a compliment"". And then she tried to convince me to let her show me some other models.

I, however, stood fast and told her I really would prefer to see someone else and apologized once again.

Her face hardened and she said that she'd go fetch someone. But before she left, she looked at me aggressively and told me that I don't have to apologize, cause this isn't the first and won't be the last time she's losing a commission due to sexism.

Was I the asshole here? I realize that the reason I gave her was maybe a bit controversial, but she asked for the truth.

8413,Not the A-hole,"I work at a small tech company where it's basically split between designers and project managers. I'm the admin assistant, so I do a little bit of everything until we find out what I'm good at. The others in the company come from much different experiences and life backgrounds than me. On the PM side, it's mostly women, and they love to talk about all the things they buy, travel, etc. 

One of them pulled me into a conversation about travel and said we should all bring in passports to compare places we've been. I said ""Oh, I've never had a passport."" She was shocked, asked me why not. I just said ""Oh, I can't really afford to travel."" She looked confused and asked about when I was growing up, where would we go on family vacations. I said we didn't and changed the subject. She kept looking at me weird after that.

Then came the purse thing. I've carried the same bag with me for about 6 years. One of the girls laughed at a fraying strap and said it was time for a new one, and suggested this brand I'd never heard of that kind of matched the style. I looked it up and said ""That's a really nice one! But wow, $150 for a purse!"" She looked at me funny and said ""Do you think that's a lot...?"" I said yes, that's basically two weeks groceries for me. She was very taken aback.

The ""inciting"" incident happened last week. One of the women recently started the process of buying a house. She's really excited and got her a nice candle. One of the women said that I was next, and I just said ""Haha, yeah right!"" One of the women asked when I thought I'd start looking, and I was honest and said that I don't really see home ownership as a part of my life. They were all shocked and kept trying to tell me why I was wrong, and I admit I got a little annoyed when they wouldn't drop it. I said ""With what money?""

It got awkward after that, and the next day one of the women pulled me aside and told me that they're sick of the way I always have to be a downer about money, and that I always make it awkward when I talk about what I can't afford. I said ""Well, how do you think it makes me feel to have you guys constantly flaunting all the purses and high end makeup and designer clothes you're wearing."" She said that they were bonding, that's what women do, and that from now on, I should try to be more discrete about the income disparity between us. 

I said ""Sure, if you guys will be, so will I."" She gave me a look and said that I'm acting kind of like an asshole and punishing them for something that's not their fault.

We’re now 29 with three children who are 2,3,6 

My SIL is Ruby, she’s 30 and has two children, Harry (5) and Kelly (8)

I will admit when I was 17 I had  ONE date with Ruby, I picked her up and dropped her off, when I dropped her off I met her sister (my wife) and I knew I couldn’t date Ruby since I was attracted to Elena (I didn’t expect Elena to *date* me I just didn’t wanna be the guy dating a girl while being attracted to her sister) 

Well it turns out the attraction was mutual and we started meeting as friends, Ruby had no problem with this and she had no problem when we started dating.

Anyway our children are super close and Ruby is always around our home.

So when my eldest asked to go park with Kelly it wasn’t a problem, I texted my wife “going park with the kids because they wanna hang with Ruby’s kid’s, you wanna meet? Maybe grab dinner with everyone?” I got a response of “okay, not a problem, no thank you” 

We spent an hour at the park (I only tagged along because I wasn’t about to leave Ruby to struggle with all the children) and then the children asked for fish and chips for dinner so I texted my wife 

“Headed to get dinner with the kiddos, won’t eat with but will bring back our dinner, love you” no response, once the children ate I grabbed dinner and left.

Thought I would post this as dreaded Thursday approaches (the day of the week when my mum rings me constantly to tell me what an awful daughter I am and accuse me of favoritism). I honestly do not think I am the AH but let's see what all of you think.

My in-laws are allowed to babysit my kids, my parents are not. My parents have constantly broken boundaries and you cannot even talk to them about it. They will scream, give you the silent treatment and all in all just ignore you and do whatever you want. My in-laws however have always show care and listen to what we say. My in-laws also have a child with special needs (my boys have special needs) and so are experienced with this. My parents 'parenting' comes down to threats and screaming in your face.

My parents were allowed to babysit for a little bit when my oldest was born ( I thought they had changed) however it quickly became apparent that they had not.

Notable incidents:

\- Complaining when my brother gave ventolin to his toddler after he got out of hospital (with oxygen troubles). They claimed he was drugging him with ventolin? My youngest son has severe asthma

\- They watched my 2 week old. I told them specifically that this bottle was old and only good for maybe 5 minutes, there was a new bottle in the bag. I come back hours later and he is feeding baby old bottle. I exclaim that's the old bottle and my dad rolls his eyes and walks away shaking his head preventing me from getting baby back.

This is just one of MANY incidents. I don't trust them. My mum says its completely unfair that they can't babysit while my in-laws can. She wants me to ring the in-laws (with her on the line) and tell them that they can't babysit ever again. My in-laws don't babysit out of necessity, occasionally they just ask for one or both boys to spend the night for fun. I absolutely do not want to punish my loving in-laws because my parents are crappy people with jealousy issues but is it fair that one set of grandparents is allowed more freedom than the other?

 In the middle of the night I awoke to hearing the couple arguing or something and the girl being hurt in some way (saying “ouch, stop” etc).
I tried to ignore it until she came out crying and I confronted the guy which nearly resulted in a fist fight and we ended up falling out. I left the situation to another hotel with my gf and me and him did not associate for the rest of the holiday.

Flash forward a few months and my gf went to their house and they tried to instigate a threesome. The girl in their relationship justified it by saying “he doesn’t want it out of lust it’s another reason I can’t tell you” which is very obviously because he hates me. (It’s blatantly obvious)
The threesome didn’t happen and the girls fell out because he told my gf she was sexy or something in private and she didn’t relay the info to his girlfriend. 

When she told me about it I told her I don’t want to hear of them ever again, and she agreed.
Recently the girls met up with mutual friends and ended up becoming friends again.
I told her I won’t have them people anywhere near my life.

My argument is basically what team are we if she’s friends with people who tried to do something for the purpose of hurting me? And if a girl tried to have sex with me out of hatred for her it would be a completely different story.

Her argument is that I am controlling her by not letting her be friends with who she wants, and I create drama by creating random vendettas against her friends

She took the tests because she believed her abusive boyfriend and his buddy tampered with her birth control. I believe this to be true.

6527,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I moved into a small block of flats last October. The neighbor across from us was frosty, touchy and a bit peculiar from the get go. One of the first things she asked us was if we would have a moving van parked in the communal drive away all day for moving - and no we didn’t. She also pointed out that the though balcony was communal the plants and furniture on it were hers- we’ve never used the balcony. 

Our flat has its own bin in the communal bin area and we share larger recycling & green waste bins with the 3 other flats. The bins are taken out on to the street weekly. We’ve always assumed that someone was paid by body corporate to do it as we don’t have a key to open the gate onto the street and our bin has always been put out and always been brought back each week. We also have a gardener for the common areas, so I figured it was something to do with them. 

Today we were having a few people over for lunch and had the front door open. I noticed the neighbor, who I rarely ever see, walk out of her flat so I called out hello. She stopped to talk to me and asked me why we never took our bins to the street.

21788,Not the A-hole,"My (22F) boyfriend (27M) asked me to wash some of his clothes for him since I was doing laundry today. I told him to put any clothes he wanted washed in my hamper and I'd include them.

He left his wallet in a pair of pants to be washed, but I didn't notice as I was putting them into the washing machine, and I assumed he would have checked them anyway considering he had already put them in my hamper. So basically, I accidentally washed his wallet.

He was looking to leave the house (and he is NOTORIOUS for misplacing his keys and wallet and then freaks when he can't find them when he wants to leave) and couldn't find his wallet, so he starts getting angry and asking if I've seen it. I asked him if he maybe left it in the pants he asked me to wash.

He says, ""you didn't check? What the fuck?"" And I said ""no, I don't leave my wallet in my pants so I don't think to check."" Cue anger from him. I go and stop the wash cycle (had been running for about 5 minutes) and check, and lo and behold, there's his wallet. Soaked.

Luckily, literally nothing was ruined- all his business cards, money, ID etc is totally fine, just needs a little while to dry. But he is so incredibly, seemingly irrationally angry at me and said I was being careless and that I've ruined his day by accidentally washing his wallet.

At first I apologized, but now I'm kind of upset that he blames me completely and is telling me to never touch his clothes again, ""let's not talk about it because I'm too mad to speak to you,"" etc. I feel like it was an honest mistake and quite frankly now I'm pissed at him for making such a big deal out of it. 

He's stomping around the house like a toddler right now slamming doors because he ""doesn't get to go"" to the gun show he wanted to, but I don't understand why he can't go with a wet wallet? None of his cash set aside to purchase the gun was even in the wallet, so it's all dry, and he could still purchase the gun. 

Anyway, I want to know if I'm biased and if I really did do something wrong by not checking his pants and even giving him some sass by saying ""I don't leave my wallet in my pants.""

14399,Not the A-hole,"I am currently studying in 12th grade. My school gives  large scholarships to the best student of the year in terms of grades and academic output every year. 
I grew up in poverty, and have a single mom as caretaker....getting the scholarship genuinely helps a lot. I would not have been able to go to school otherwise.


This year, there was a tie between me and another girl.
Call her F for all I care honestly.

 Both of us got the same final grades. I told them we would split the money in half and share them, but F wants the prize to go to any one of us.
I beg her in private to split the prize and talk about my condition.

 Both of her parents are rich and she lives in a posh area where apartments cost over a million, she comes with a driver to school. She doesn't need the money as badly as I do.

But F still wants to take the prize. Teachers go for the second criteria ,which was who had the higher competitive exam score, and of freaking course she does.
I could only afford one attempt with no private tutors but had a lower score by 20 points from one attempt as compared to her best of score, section wise, from 5 attempts.
Scholarship goes to her, I get transferred to a far worse school. Life goes on.

But then she personally messages me pictures of her necklace and how she bought it and snidely asked if the bathrooms at poor schools were as bad as she heard.

I screenshot the conversation and posted it on social media along with what she did. 
Half of the people are siding with me for the most part but I have honestly never done something like this and she might be losing popularity fast.
I avoid confrontations at all costs and I felt scared doing this stuff for people to judge. Plus plenty of people are giving me tasteful messages too.

6138,Asshole,"Earlier this year I started a gaming group of me and six other friends. We meet up fairly regularly at a player's house. This player, we'll call him Steve, was dating Jane, another player.

About a month or so ago, Steve and Jane broke up. She got over it fairly quickly and acted like nothing had happened. He, on the other hand, was rather hurt. We continued to have game nights at his house until two weeks ago, when he told us he tried to be ok with being around Jane but he wasn't. He didn't want to see her anymore, even if it meant leaving the group.

None of the others wanted to choose between two friends so the ugly decision fell to me, being the one to make the group in the first place. After a long talk with Jane, I told her that without Steve we didn't have a venue and without a venue we can't play. I told her that game nights will resume in two week's time on the 30th and that if we can't find a venue by then we would start playing at Steve's, without her. Jane blew up at me, saying that we are kicking her out, that it wasn't fair, and that Steve will let her come over after he's had a while to get over the breakup. I told her that my decision is final.

On one hand, I feel like my decision was logical and in the best interests of the group. On the other hand, I feel like an asshole. Reasons I feel this way:

\- I am not unbiased in this decision. I am on ""Steve's side"" of the breakup, though I will not admit this to my neutral friends. Also, though Jane was never ""that player"", there were definitely times where she got close.

\- Jane is more stubborn and vocal about wanting to play. Steve was willing to gracefully bow out of the group if that's what we decided, though he does want to keep playing with us.

\- Jane was the one that brought Steve to the group in the first place.

\- I don't think Jane will be able to find a venue. Steve's house is free and central, and no cafe or meeting room matches that. I am also not going to help her search. I basically set her up to fail because I had neither the spine nor the decency to kick her outright.

\- The 30th is a deadline I made up- I can extend it if I want to. But I am not going to, because I want this all to be over, one way or another. Anyway I doubt more time will change anything.

\- I feel like my decision will ruin the other players' friendships with Jane.

So tell me reddit. AITA?

&#x200B;

\*Edit: I think there might be a little bit of confusion- While venue is definitely a problem which we would have had to address, the biggest reason for my decision is that I wanted to play with Steve over Jane. Steve wants to play with us as much as Jane does but he's willing to leave to keep the peace. I was not ok with this so I used venue as an excuse when talking to Jane. If that makes me more of an asshole then so be it. I just thought I should clarify.

&#x200B;

\*Edit 2: Hi everyone. After you judged me the asshole, I told my friends my horrible reasons behind my decision. They are the ones that are affected by this situation, they personally know the people involved, they know what it's like to be in the group. They deserve to know my reasoning and call me the asshole more than any internet stranger. You are all right. I am an asshole. I am my group's asshole.

17000,Not the A-hole,"Some quick context: I am a homosexual 17 year old guy. I came out of the closet about two years ago in a pretty liberal country. Virtually everyone in my area accepted it.

When I told my classmates that I like men, noone really had a problem with it except this one guy, who was really shocked. It was the prankster of the classroom and was into football, which made him behave a tad macho. He told me that he had difficulties with me being gay, but liked me as a person so he would try to get over it. I said I respected that, we made a lot of jokes about it, we talked to eachother sometimes and untill he changed class, we had regular contact.

This valentine there was an event at our school that made it possible to buy roses for people you liked. You could send them and write a little card attached to it that said who it was from and a reason why you sent it. I send some to a few friends and decided to send one to that guy too as a prank. I wrote my name on it and a little heart.

I always used to joke with it a tad, but have told him many times that I could never be into him, so I thought it would be a good prank. He apparently didnt think so.

When I was walking past them that day, his entire friend group was staring at me. I asked (already laughing on the inside): ""Did you like the rose?""
He exclaimed ""So it was really you?!"" And I laughed loudly and walked away, signaling that it was a joke. I didnt see him again that day (school was ending at that time) and went home. The next day everybody in that clique was staring at me again. When I went away I heard someone whispering ""dirty faggot"". Some friends (who thought it was a hillarious joke) also said they heard them insulting me loudly in frond of a lot of pupils.

I honestly don't care about the insults. I have heard worse and have quite a thick skin, but it made me realise that maybe I crossed a line.

Although I attend all weekly sessions, role-play, and take time writing down my stats, he is clearly more (mentally and financially) invested in the game than me. He bought himself books, figurines, and maps, listens to D&D podcasts, reads a bunch of D&D subs, and brings that topic into our conversations (Ex. asks me what class each of our friends would be in real life, sends me D&D memes, etc.). He even bought me a figurine and a starter dice set (7 dice for $5).  

Last week, he gifted me a beautiful set of pure rose quartz dice, which costed $80 (7 dice for $80). I was in shock. I thanked him for the gift, but immediately asked him to return them. He was visibly upset and told me he wanted me to have the prettiest dice in the campaign. I explained that I enjoyed D&D because I could use my imagination and spend time with our friends, and not so I could have the “best” apparatus to play with.

2403,Not the A-hole,"Husband (26M) and I (25F) got married two weekends ago. We got our pictures back four days after the wedding, and I was pretty bummed about how they turned out. Everyone keeps telling me that I should tell our wedding photographer that I was disappointed with our pictures, but I really don't see the point. She was fairly inexpensive, so I feel like we got what we paid for (about 1/2 the cost of a typical photographer, because we got married on a Sunday and did a bundle deal with her and another vendor). I feel like I'd be the asshole for telling her what we didn't like, because I really don't see the point in saying anything after the fact, but other people are saying feedback will help her future brides have better pictures.

""Hi, (Photographer)-

I can’t believe it’s been two weeks already! Thanks for getting our pictures back to us so quickly. While some of our pictures are truly lovely, there were a lot of things impacting the majority of our pictures that are keeping us from sharing them with our family and friends.

Firstly, there are no pictures of just (groom) and his grandfather, which I had specifically asked for;

Secondly, all but one of the pictures of the bridal party and myself walking down the aisle have (DJ) in the background (not setting up equipment, just pacing at the back of the room);

Thirdly, I wish small things such as (Groom's) tie being crooked and my necklace being stuck behind my dress in every formal picture had been pointed out so we could correct them;

And lastly, most of the shots of objects like my ring and purse are crooked or off-kilter. 

Also, most pictures were taken with such a wide angle that we don’t seem to be the focus of the pictures, because there’s so much other stuff visible. 

I hope that this feedback helps make the pictures better for future brides.

Regards, (Me, Bride)""

3023,Asshole,"My fiancé (22F) and I (25M) have been living together for about a year now.  We have our small fights here and there, as all couples do when they first experience being around each other 24/7, but nothing serious.  She can be stubborn and temperamental (as can I), but I love her so much and I can't wait to marry her.  However, she has one quirk that really rubs me the wrong way sometimes.  For background, she's a pretty light sleeper, whereas I could probably sleep through a tornado.  If she goes to bed first, there's a good chance that me attempting to get into bed will wake her, no matter how quiet I think I'm being. The problem is that I'm a notorious snorer.  According to my family, my snoring sounds like a wild boar (I've recorded myself and I don't think it's THAT bad, but can confirm it's fairly loud).  Since we moved to our apartment, my fiancé has only gotten worse in her light sleeping habits, partially due to her paranoia of a new environment (we don't live in the safest area ever, lots of break-ins, robberies, etc. so it's not exactly baseless).  This means that if she's not dead asleep when I go to bed, my snoring can evidently wake her up pretty easily.  My issue is that if my snoring wakes her up, she will then wake ME up, regardless of what time it is, and make me adjust my pillows or turn over or whatever to try to make me stop.  This usually doesn't work, so she'll wake me up AGAIN and try again. The worst is that if her calling to me doesn't wake me, she'll sometimes nudge me pretty hard in the side.  I haven't said anything to her, as I know she's a light sleeper and that's not her fault, but it sometimes really annoys me that she will wake me up an hour before I have to get up for work just because she wants me to stop snoring, which is something I have very little control over, especially since I get up early (around 6 a.m.) and she gets several more hours of sleep after I'm gone (she's a student and her classes usually won't start until 9 or 10 a.m.). So, I want to ask her to stop waking me up, as I don't get enough sleep already, and her waking me only makes me more exhausted when I do get up. I've considered a CPAP, but that's a lot of money for a loud machine that would probably also wake her and wouldn't necessarily fix my snoring.  WIBTA for bringing this up to her?

TL;DR - Fiancé will wake me up for snoring and waking her often, and I want to ask her to stop.

EDIT: Thanks for all the helpful comments, my guys.  Some were harsh, but hey, no biggie, my post DOES sound super selfish and a bit whiney.

15539,Not the A-hole,"Hi, all. I'm going to be a little deliberately vague about specifics, because my partner is a Redditor, too. 

We're both in our 20s and have been together for nearly a decade. We just relocated to a new city for SO's career, but are making very little money and it's tough to make ends meet sometimes. We currently both work in the gig economy, so income can be unpredictable from week to week. SO comes from a wealthy family, and it's their family who is helping us out with our rent, so our primary expenses are food, gas, groceries, and utilities. 

Well, my SO is crazy irresponsible with finances, even with the little money we do have. Part of it isn't in their control, because they have a mental illness, and one of the main symptoms is compulsively spending. So I feel bad for criticizing their habits... but on the other hand, because SO comes from a wealthy background, I also feel that they have no concept of what it's like to budget. My SO has never had to penny-pinch or sacrifice to make ends meet. I came from a family that wasn't nearly as privileged, and regularly had to make money stretch from paycheck to paycheck.

Because of their habits, I'm completely in charge of our finances, and I hate it. SO begs me every day to eat out, or to ""treat ourselves"" because they worked hard or had a stressful day. I do empathize, but it's just not financially responsible for us. What really drives me crazy is when they beg to go out for food when we already have stuff at home. I'll even list the things we have, but they will insist that they just aren't hungry for those things. It makes me want to scream, ""So what?! Tough it out!"" But I never do. Sometimes I just give in because I'm tired of arguing about it every fucking day. 

Sometimes to make our money stretch until payday, I skip meals. My SO never does, and that makes me resent them, if I'm totally honest.

Because when I do suggest we be more frugal, they get really upset. They always say that, in the worst case scenario, their parents will send us money. I'm appreciative of the help they already give us, I don't want them to give us anymore. I really want us to stick it out for ourselves. But they say that I'm the asshole for making them stressed over a ""non issue.""

16751,Not the A-hole,"This is definitely a much smaller AITA than some on here, but its driving me bonkers. Context: I've lived with my boyfriend for over a year. He owns the house and pays the mortgage on it, but all other bills are split evenly... Except for groceries. Originally the plan was to take turns, which worked for a while. 

However, its deteriorated to taking quick grocery runs just to grab what we need, and since I'm the one who cooks most often (I eat keto so its easier for me to make the food) I'll typically be the one who gets groceries for dinner that night. Also among my purchases are modified versions of favorite snacks that fit my dietary needs (like Atkins bars instead of regular granola bars, or Halo Top instead of regular ice cream), which are generally more expensive than normal items.

My problem is that my boyfriend eats all my special foods instead of the plethora of things in the house that aren't keto (example, he has his own ice cream but will chow through a pint of Halo Top). I asked him to stop and his response is that he thought ""we shared things equally."" I wouldn't mind as much if he occasionally bought these things, but he doesn't. 

Recently I bought some keto approved snack cakes online and he immediately wanted some. I told him I only bought coconut flavor (he hates coconut). I actually got a variety pack. He caught me eating a lemon one and blew up about it because I lied to him, and we could have shared but I was being selfish, and that I was being a jerk about my food. I just dont wanna spend a bunch of money on pricey keto foods and have him eat them when he could eat regular food. AITA?

EDIT: Because this seems to be a big sticking point for people, the reason I do not pay half the mortgage is not because I CAN'T, its because my bf wants to move into a much larger house, which would require me to not have student loans. I am fine where we are, but am putting that money towards loans so we can purchase a house on two full incomes.",69,59,0.94,AITA for lying about food to my boyfriend?,awc0gm,2019-03-02 00:56:58,NTA,1987,AITA
8192,Asshole,"For context, I am half German and half Taiwanese. While I am not religious myself, my whole family on my mother's side is Buddhist, and I grew up with the religion. The swastika is a Buddhist religious symbol, and it is commonly seen in temples and on the chest of Buddha statues.

Some time ago, I bought a T-shirt. The design says ""Rock Buddha"", and it shows a cartoon Buddha wearing sneakers and drinking coke, and - he has the swastika on his chest. I bought the shirt simply because I liked the design, I like rock music and Buddhism was a pretty big part of my upbringing.

But of course I'm aware that the sign has a big Nazi connotation outside of Asia. I've been living in a German expat community in Asia, and although there have been some fake-shocked/amused comments, everyone knows that I'm not a Nazi and this isn't supposed to be a Nazi symbol. It's all cool. But, I am moving to Germany, and I'm not sure if it is still appropriate to wear the shirt there. My thinking is that the context of the Buddha would make it clear to everyone that it is used in the religious sense, not the hateful one. But maybe the connection to Buddhism isn't strong enough in Europe? Would it be offensive to wear this shirt? WIBTA?

Edit: Okay, guess I was too naive and a dick. I can live with that, and the shirt will be leaving my closet.

Edit: Just to clarify, I'm a girl/she

Edit because this has come up multiple times - the swastika on the shirt is not identical with the Nazi swastika. Like most (but not all) buddhist swastikas it is left-facing instead of right-facing, and horizontal instead of diagonally tilted. I'm not saying this makes it better, just answering an FAQ",201,232,0.86,WIBTA for wearing a Buddhist swastika in Germany?,cg1l0l,2019-07-21 17:30:03,YTA,1682,WIBTA
3820,No A-holes here,"  

As the title says, I’m a vegetarian. And although I’m not one of those militant vegetarians, and on the whole very pragmatic about it, vegetarianism is something I do feel very strongly about.

**Current situation:**

My company works on an account for a meat-focused restaurant chain helping them to promote their stores. It’s been a client for a couple of years now and sits within my wider team. Despite there being several occasions in the past where I’ve been asked to become significantly involved in the account, the company has respected my decision when I’ve refused.

I’ve not completely avoided the account, occasionally helping out with mechanical tasks like proofing or offering up other resources for the team to use. I’ve been ok with this level of input because it has never involved much thought from my side. Essentially, it would happen the same with or without my input so I might as well help my team (who I’m on good terms with) and I don’t feel like I’m betraying my beliefs as a result. 

Anyway, due to some changes at work, I’m being asked again to take on more responsibility with the account. Initially I was asked to lead the overall account as day-to-day client contact  – something I was able to push back on and convince them was not a good idea. However, they are still asking me to play a core role behind the scenes, leading the strategy and execution. In contrast to the current situation, I would need to contribute thinking and actively use my skillset to help promote a cause which I believe to be inherently bad.

**WIBTA for refusing to take on this account?** Some more info below to help you see things from both sides:

**Why I might be an asshole:**

* · I have the capacity to take this on at the moment. It would also most likely end up with someone who doesn’t have much extra capacity to support if I refuse.
* · Other than me being a vegetarian, I’m probably the best person in the company to be working on this account, based on my skillset and other experience
* · I’ve worked on the account before, as mentioned above, so it may look like I’m just playing the vegetarian card as it suits me

**Why I don’t think I’m an asshole:**

* · This is a long-held belief of mine that’s well-known in the company. It should be obvious that a vegetarian shouldn’t work on this account, and when I have supported in the past, it’s been clear that it is only in a very basic capacity and has still been a considerable compromise on my part
* · The minute I start trying to think about ideas for the client, I feel this huge contradiction and can’t allow myself to think any further. In all honesty, I’d be happy if this restaurant chains goes out of business so it’s hard to think up strategies that are designed to do the exact opposite
* · Agreeing to contribute to something that goes against my beliefs is the definition of selling out. Even if my job was to be threatened (which it shouldn’t come to, but you never know), I should still stick to my beliefs. Otherwise, what’s the point in having them?",666,669,0.87,WIBTA: Vegetarian refusing to work on meat-related advertising account at work.,d6sy4f,2019-09-20 10:30:36,NAH,3050,WIBTA
16889,No A-holes here,"Basically I’m an event planner. This means I work odd hours in addition to the 9-5 we all know and love. 

Last night I reminded my DH that he needed to pick up our son from school because I have an event today-an event that goes til midnight. It’s been on the calendar for a month, but he was still shocked and a bit upset that I’ll be gone so long. No biggie tho, he’s happy to have some one on one with his kid. 

We go to bed late and he’s trying to get something started. It’s been a couple days, but I’m just not feeling it. Not in a bad way, I’m just really content with the day and for the life of me cannot think my way into sexy time right then. I told him we could have sex if he was determined, but that I wasn’t in the mood. I feel bad for turning him down, but I got really cuddly which he loves. 

This morning it’s pitch black out and I can tell DH is trying to get some sexy time started again. He keeps moving me around to cuddle closer and tries to kiss my neck and such. He also keeps pulling the blanket off my butt and I’m freezing to death. I’m clearly trying to sleep and roll over to signal, not now, buddy. After almost 40 mins he’s like “okay, gotta go, last cuddle!” Right as my alarm goes off. So I yelled “I just want to sleep damn it!”  Right as he goes in for a last hug. He says “fine!” And gets up. I hit snooze. 

Not two minutes later our son (3years old) starts whining in my face about how daddy left and he wants his TV (he gets 30 mins before school so I can get dressed). I’m furious and call DH and tell him next time he refuses to let me sleep, at least take a minute to take care of the kid. DH said “I know you hate me so much, but I’m not even gone yet, I’ll fix his TV.” 

I don’t hate him. I’m just about to go into a 15 1/2 hour work day with only 4.5 hours of sleep and I don’t see why wanting to sleep til my alarm is a crime. I feel bad I turned him down twice in a row, but can’t a guy take a hint that I want to keep sleeping?

21728,Asshole,"Okay I know this sounds bad. 

Back around June my fiance and I returned to our old apartment one last time (after being home with our parents for a month) to pack up our stuff and move across country. We checked the mail right before we left and noticed that there was a package left in our mailbox, but it wasn't addressed to us. It wasn't even addressed to our apartment building. We were about to get in the uhaul for the drive so I figured I would just take it with me and we'd find a way to send it back once we got moved in to our new place.

Okay well I kind of forgot about it until recently, but I took it one day and tried to take it to a USPS blue box thinking I could write ""return to sender"" and send it that way. Of course the package didn't fit in there so that was a dead end. 

So this is where maybe I am the asshole. I decided to open the box to see if it's anything worth my time and effort to send back. And I wish I hadn't. It's a $150 knife. Like, somebody actually spent $150 on this knife that was never delivered to them...... Now I feel stuck because on the one hand that's a lot of money for a knife, but on the other hand it's not like it was like a gift from grandma before she died or something that is irreplaceable like that. It was obviously a company that sent the knife out so I imagine they probably would have received a replacement knife by now.

So, would I be the asshole if I just gave up trying to send this package back and kept it? I don't even want the knife it just seems like too much effort that I don't really have the time or desire to figure out.

Edit: Alright fair enough guys, I am the asshole. I guess I posted here because I knew that I was being assholey and I wanted to get some other perspectives. I will return the box!

2405,Not the A-hole,"This is actually 'are we the assholes' - my mom (60) and I (19) - here. My mom feels bad and knows I read this sub, so asked me to post this.

My mom doesn't always host Thanksgiving but wanted to this year. This meant \*I\* would also be hosting Thanksgiving, as it's a lot of work so I help her out usually by making dessert and most of the side dishes while she handles turkey, gravy and potatoes. I told her what I was planning on making last week, she said sounds good, and we bought most of the ingredients 3 days ago.

Invited to Thanksgiving was my sister and her husband, her husband's mom, my mom's oldest friend/my godfather, and our elderly neighbour. My sister was to bring wine and the other guests were bring appetizers. Also going to be there would be my mom, dad, brother (30M) and I, who all live in one house. 

Last night, my brother asked if there was anything he could do for Thanksgiving. At that point everything was set and my mom and I were definitely worried about a 'too many cooks in the kitchen' situation as my brother is a chef by trade and has a tendency to take over the whole kitchen just to make salad dressing, so my mom said 'I think we'll be okay but thank you for offering. I'll let you know if you can help out in any way tomorrow.' He started to get a bit insistent on making something but my mom and I both said really we had everything planned, and my dad said as it was, he thought there would be way too much food. 

My brother got up early this afternoon, the day we were hosting Thanksgiving with everyone to come by at 5 and asked my mom to take him to the grocery store because he still really wanted to make a dish. My mom repeated what we said last night and told him it was too late, the stores would be too busy, and at this point another dish would mess up our plans. Additionally, my brother is still getting over a bit of a cold, so my mom wasn't sure if he would be contagious still or not and wasn't really wanting to risk it, considering my sister is very anal about getting sick. He got mad and upset and accused us of not wanting him around and complaining he never does anything around the house but then not letting him doing anything when he does want to. He went down to his room and slammed the door and has been in his room since. 

He is also notorious for throwing a wrench into our plans at the last minute, and he's a very stressful person to be around in the kitchen, as he treats our home kitchen like his restaurant's kitchen and doesn't have much regard for what my mom or I are doing. Personally, I wouldn't have wanted him to make a dish and be in the kitchen with my mom and I at all tonight when we're cooking however if he had asked last week before we planned and bought all the ingredients, I probably would've just sucked it up and said he could make a salad or stuffing or something.

9185,Asshole,"My friend and I disagree strongly on this, and as we both lurk this subreddit, we saw no better way to solve the argument than right here.

Some background information. I've never owned a pet before so I don't know completely how one is supposed to be treated. This past week, I was staying at friend A's house for a few days with her parents, and they owned a cat. It was super friendly, so I wasn't worried about being bitten or anything, but I never carried it around or really handled it in any way either. Friend B was also present. For the first three days I was there, the cat would always come up to the table while we were eating and paw on our chairs to get some of the food. When it came up to us, the family would shoo it away. But it would come over time and time again to beg, and I honestly felt bad for it.

Here's where the fuck up happened. The parents made some steaks and put it on plates for us to eat. When we were finished eating, there was only one steak left on the plate. Around 10 minutes after we finished eating, something happened that drew everyone's attention to a different room; it was important, but also none of my business, so I stayed behind at the table. Seeing this opportunity, the cat walks over, and jumps from the floor, to an empty chair, to the table, and starts eating the last steak. My first instinct was to tell the family, but they were super engrossed in what they're doing. So not wanting to disturb them, and frankly not seeing the situation as urgent, I just let the cat keep eating the steak. Admittedly, friend A's dad walked through room at some point and didn't notice the cat; I could have told him, but had never really talked to him before, and felt uncomfortable doing so.

By the time everyone comes back, the cat actually finished the entire steak and had begun licking the plate clean. Apparently, they didn't want the cat eating people food at all, and were shocked after realizing it finished the whole thing. The parents weren't mad at me, but friend B says I'm TA for letting the cat eat it. She argues that I should have known that the cat wasn't allowed to eat people food given how everyone was treating it, and that someone else might have wanted the steak for later; I should have told the dad, or just moved it myself. As I see it, I shouldn't have been expected to know how to treat someone else's pet, and even if I did I shouldn't be expected to physically move it away from the table. If someone wanted the steak, they should have put it somewhere where the cat couldn't reach it, given they had time to before leaving it alone. Plus the damn thing wanted human food the whole time I was there, and I didn't want to take the moment away from it. AITA?

19657,Asshole," I (33M) have been married to my wife (32F) for the past 5 years. 6 months ago my wife decided to undergo rhinoplasty (nose job) surgery due to not liking the shape of her nose for several years and also to repair a deviated septum (although the primary reason was cosmetic). I personally didn’t think she needed the surgery and the money could have been better spent, but agreed it was her choice to make. 

Here’s where my wife thinks I was the asshole: I was driving her to the surgery and she was getting very nervous thinking about how it could all go wrong. Meanwhile, I was dead tired and it was early in the morning. She caught on that I wasn’t in the best mood and asked how I felt about driving her to the surgery. I responded “To be honest, I’m not looking forward to taking care of you after the surgery”. 

She started melting down, telling me I should have told her earlier if I wasn’t willing to support her recovery. I clarified that I loved her and would take care of her, but I just wasn’t looking forward to it since the surgery was elective and avoidable. This did not placate her and she only got more angry/sad. I apologized profusely after realizing how upset she was, but it was kind of half-hearted because I still thought I was right. 

Fast forward to the present: the surgery went well, I supported my wife as she was recovering, and life is back to normal. However, my wife still thinks I was the asshole for not being more emotionally supportive of her on surgery day. I think I’m probably the asshole but wanted to post to be sure.

21571,Not the A-hole,"I (31F) am married and live with my husband (30M) and our 6 month old son. My husband takes antidepressants and has specifically been told my his GP NOT to stop taking them cold turkey. He works long hours doing physical work. He loves his job but it is demanding. I am a stay at home mum to our baby, also demanding. We live at his work place so he comes home for lunch. I take care of most of the jobs around the house but usually need a bit of help in the evenings around dinner time, sometimes with dinner or dishes and sometimes I just need him to mind the baby.

So yesterday he had a really long physically demanding day. He came home for lunch and I told him I would try and have dinner ready for when he came in and asked what time that would be. He said 6pm. I had a busy day myself and was proud of how much I had managed to get done. I brought in the washing, took baby for a walk, changed nappies, fed baby solids twice, breastfed 4 times, prepared and cooked 2 weeks worth of vegetables for baby, vacuumed 3 bedrooms, hallway and lounge on my hand and knees (broken vacuum cleaner), did the dishes, fed the cats, prepared potatoes for dinner, general tidy up, all while looking after and entertaining a 6 month old baby... you get the picture.

At around 5.30 I turned on the oven to pre-heat, had the potatoes ready to go in the pot, on the hob. Aiming to have it ready just after 6. Baby starts loosing his shit because he's tired and hungry so I sit down to breastfeed him and browse the internet while doing so. Baby falls asleep while feeding and about 2 minutes later husband walks in (15 mins early). As baby has just fallen asleep, I ask him if he can put the sausages on a tray and put them into the pre-heated oven and switch the hob on. He makes a comment about how when he came home I was ""just sitting there on the internet"". I told him I was FEEDING OUR BABY and can't do both at once. He said he ""pretty much ended up cooking dinner"" and I shouldn't ""write cheques my ass can't cash"" (I won't even start on how hypocritical that comment is). It was me that prepared the potatoes, preheated the oven, mashed the potatoes, cooked the peas, plated it, cleared the table. All he had to do was put the sausages in the oven and switch the hob on because he was early and our baby needed fed.

The next day I find out he has (yet again) stopped taking his pills against the advice of his GP. He told me he is ""fine"" and to get out of ""his"" house. I know that the reason he is acting like this is because he has stopped taking his pills. The same kind of crap has happened before, the last time was probably only about a month ago.

9453,Not the A-hole,"So to set up the incident, my fiancé and I had been living across the country from our home state and she got pregnant. We were both very excited but she wanted to move back home. Her mom offered for us to stay with her until we could get on our feet back in our home state. I pay her mother rent and everything so it’s not a straight hand out (I’d prefer to pay because we’re not trying to free load). The baby was born in February and he is our pride and joy. My fiancé and I are a good team and we split the night in half for responsibilities and any other time we try to split directly in half as well. 

Recently, so we could have more income and eventually be set to move out, I changed jobs so I could work the second shift, freeing up my fiancé to then get a part time first shift job. Now, important to note, my FMIL has worked a full time first shift job for 5 years. She comes home about 6 and is in bed by 9. Kindly, when I was also working first shift, she would hold the baby while My fiancé and I ate dinner. I don’t think speed eating is something to be proud of, but I never made her hold him more than 10 minutes so I could scarf my food down. 

So now that I’ve started my new job, I’m not around for the 3 hours a day that she’s there with the baby and my fiancé. So my first night off seeing the three of them in the 3 hour window, she says to the baby “look it’s your uncle lukeonice”. I immediately was taken aback by this and took the baby off to change him to avoid being confrontational. She said as I was leaving and as she’s realizing I’m offended that “the baby has been a holy terror in the evening and she  didn’t mean to upset me”. I just decided to try to put the baby down for an evening nap and avoid her for a little while. 

When I see her later in the evening she tells me that she meant it to be an “endearing term” and wasn’t trying to offend me while simultaneously acting very obviously that she doesn’t understand why I’m so bothered by it. I obviously didn’t  buy that because she tried to explain herself out of it initially by saying that the baby was being difficult at night while I wasn’t there. I also found out today from my fiancé that she tried to explain to her mother how offensive her comment is. She tried to ask about even if she meant it “endearingly”, does she see how it might be offensive if it wasn’t meant that way, and her mother said “no, and I don’t understand why he’s upset, I think he’s being sensitive.” So I’ve been avoiding her like the plague because I don’t want to have a confrontation and I’m still very offended and it’s only grown as I’ve heard her excuses and lack of remorse. 

I think what bothers me most of all is that I am trying my hardest to be a very active father and watch him at least 12 hours of every single day.

16325,Not the A-hole,"Definitely a bit of backstory required here.

As I'm sure you can tell by the title, a lifelong friend of mine (we'll call him Jack), isn't being invited to my wedding. Jack has always been extremely nice to me, almost to a fault, but has made some really poor decisions over the last 3-5 years or so. This has in turn has lead up to an increasingly distant friendship between us.

One of the first reasons I was hesitant to invite him was due to his ongoing issues with another close friend of mine that will be at our wedding. We'll call him Steve. Without going into too much detail, Jack cannot stand Steve over some pretty juvenile and petty shit from years ago. Not that Steve was 100% in the right to begin with, but Jack has taken his ""hatred"" for Steve way too far. Threatening him, assaulting him, showing up at his house in the middle of the night, some REALLY crazy shit. On top of that, they have been in and out of legal proceedings because of it. Steve has tried to just let it go since he doesn't want to ruin Jack's life/future, but Jack continues to test his patience. The final straw was last time we had friends over to our house, Jack followed Steve outside and threatened to kill him, which caused a scene and ultimately tarnished what little rapport he had with my soon-to-be wife. This alone was enough to decide that inviting him to a wedding that they would both be attending was probably a bad idea, but unfortunately it does not stop there.

I still talk to quite a few mutual friends that Jack and I have, and from what I have heard, he has recently became re-involved with cocaine. This includes selling it to friends and trying to talk his friends (and their spouses) into sneaking off to do it with him. Let me be clear, my fiancee and I do not do drugs in any capacity, so that is 100% off limits for us. I am definitely not trying to be DARE Officer Dan here, but there is a pretty obvious line between casually smoking weed and slamming rails of coke.

All of that being said, I still can't shake this feeling that I am being an asshole by not inviting him. I've known him my whole life and he has always gone out of his way to be a good friend to me. And I know that if I ever needed a place to stay or a shirt on my back, he'd be the first person to give me both. But on the biggest day of my life, surrounded by family and friends, I can't risk him getting drunk and emotional and hauling off on Steve, or taking bumps in the bathroom while a family member is trying to take a piss in the urinal next to him. Even if he was on best behavior, I feel like both me and my fiancee would have to have our heads on a swivel and be alert to what he was doing and where he was all night. And that doesn't seem like a very fair compromise for us on our wedding day.

AITA here? I guess I'd be lying if I said I wasn't somewhat afraid of the fallout with him too, considering the drug abuse and his continually deteriorating mental state.",14,44,0.93,AITA for not inviting a lifelong friend to my wedding?,azu649,2019-03-11 14:36:55,NTA,2966,AITA
10995,Asshole,"Firstly, let me start by saying that one of my big pet peeves in life is people walking (or driving) in public whilst not looking where they're going. 

So, a while ago, I was walking down the street with my friend. We noticed that, coming the other direction, was a professional looking woman in her late 40s/early 50s. We also noticed that she was engrossed in her phone and not, at any point, looking up to check her surroundings. We were fated to be on a collision course if we both kept going in a straight line.

As a matter of principle, I decided to hold my course. I was staring at her intently for about 10-12 seconds (whilst continuing to walk forward), waiting for her to look up and notice that we were there. I would have been happy to move a little if she had seen us but I chose not to. 

Inevitably, we collided. Only a brush of shoulders but it was enough to dislodge her phone from her hand. I didn't stick around to assess the damage but the sound of phone hitting floor and the mutterings of sadness I could hear from her were enough to assume the phone had some damage.

I could have easily taken a step to my left (she would have then cut through me and my friend) as it was a wide path but I didnt think I should have to move for someone who can't look where they're going.

1978,No A-holes here,"My girlfriend and I were dining at a local fast casual restaurant tonight when another diner came in to order. As soon as she walked in, we noticed that she had a very overwhelming odor, even when she was 10+ feet away from us. We’re not sure if she was homeless, or simply didn’t have access or ability to shower, but it was enough that it made us pretty quickly lose our appetite due to how distracting it was.

We thought we were in the clear after she ordered, but she just so happened to sit at the table directly adjacent to us. We debated what to do, and decided that we couldn’t finish our food there - we were either going to wait a few minutes and grab to go boxes, or move tables.

Luckily for us, the woman went inside to grab some napkins, so we seized the opportunity to move somewhere else (this restaurant is next to a food court so we knew we could move out of sight).

However, as we were hurrying to leave while she was inside, she exited the restaurant and made eye contact with us, making us feel like complete assholes.

It wasn’t anything personal and we are sympathetic to what is likely not a good living situation for this woman, but we still feel terrible that we likely made this woman self conscious as we were obviously taking our food somewhere else.

3362,Not the A-hole,"This literally just happened and I'm still kinda ticked. For context, I'm an early 30s woman who lives with my boyfriend. I'm frequently home during the day while he's at work. The neighbours in question are backyard neighbours, so the back of their backyard runs along the side of our backyard. I hope that makes sense. 

Soo I was just getting ready to take a shower, was undressed under my housecoat and grabbing a towel from the linen closet when I heard knocking at my door, followed a minute later by the doorbell. I wasn't expecting anyone, and in my current state of undress I didn't feel comfortable answering the door, so I ignored it. 

I was about to head to the bathroom when I saw a couple people coming down the driveway. Halfway down the drive we have a gate that we keep shut, latched and locked whenever we're home. It's over 5 feet tall and super awkward to unlatch/unlock from the outside. So I watch their figures through the closed curtains walking up and down the drive a couple times until they give up and leave. 

I got dressed then because I was like, Wtf is going on? Not five minutes have gone by, when I open my front door and see no one, no cars. But I see the front gate was left opened. I go over to close it, because we keep all gates closed so that our dog can roam freely, and see that the back gate is still closed. 

So I head back inside when I hear a far-off *Helloooo?*. I've got pretty sensitive anxiety and it just spiked at this point. I head to the back door and see someone standing there. It took me a moment to figure out it was my neighbor. He was very jovial, told me he was trying to get a hold of me because they had the cable guy over and he wanted access to my backyard. I was like, ""Fine, whatever. Bye."" But he kept asking if something was wrong, and kept pressing me when I tried to go back inside. 

My dog ran out and with the gates being open I called him back inside, and my neighbour continued to press me if there was anything wrong. I snapped and said, ""Yes! I was getting in the shower and then there were people running all around the house. I didn't know what was going on.""

He got really offended and reiterated that they weren't *in* my house. I said, ""No, just letting yourself through a locked gate and coming to the back door instead of waiting at the front door and ringing the bell again."" I closed the door and he let himself back out the gate, and the cable guy never even came in the backyard. 

I'm feeling a bit jerky but also like, no. His wife came and left after ringing the bell. He then took it upon himself to come back, not even attempt to go to the front door, but let himself into the closed yard when I'm home by myself and hadn't answered at the front door? I'll take my judgement, either way. If I was wrong I'll bake some humble pie.",111,310,0.95,AITA for being short with my neighbour after he let himself into my gated backyard?,da6eo0,2019-09-27 20:54:10,NTA,2826,AITA
18198,Not the A-hole,"So I’ve been working from home for obvious reasons lately. We have a home office with an attached bathroom. My job is one that forces me to be on the computer the entire time I’m working. I also have an active webcam that has a constant feed of me and my team. Occasionally higher ups will check in on us thru the same live feed.

The issue is that in the first few weeks my wife and 5 year old daughter had difficulty dealing with the fact that I’m actually working and not hanging out at home. I kept the door closed but didn’t lock it, but my wife and daughter would constantly enter the room, peek at my screen, talk to me, ask me for things, tell me to come over here, etc. 

Eventually I told them that this is making me look really unprofessional and they should stop interrupting me while I’m at work. My wife got offended and said that if I’m at home I should interact with our daughter more anyways.

Another thing is I typically eat lunch by myself since I can’t be away from my computer for long. (I eat in front of the screen) My wife is also pissed at this as she says we should be having meals as a family if I’m home. Except lunch with them runs for more than an hour and I just can’t spare the time. 

Recently I’ve locked the door to the office and told them to knock only if it’s an emergency and otherwise imagine me far away at work. In response my wife has been knocking aggressively in the mornings to annoy me. Or she’ll knock hard while passing the door and leave before I can get there. She’s been telling our daughter that “daddy doesn’t care about us enough to see us” and that makes me really upset too. 

I feel really guilty about having to ignore my kid during the day but I just really want them both to understand that I’m still working even though I’m at home. But now my daughter truly believes I’m ignoring her on purpose. AITA?

EDIT: my wife is a SAHM and we have a live in nanny, so they don’t need me to help out. They want me to hang out and go do things like cook or watch tv with them.

I work in financial markets and I literally cannot take watercooler breaks like other jobs. I’m in front of my computer screen all day and we are in constant communication with the rest of the fund. You don’t step away unless it’s a bathroom break. My job consists of a lot of time sensitive tasks so it’s not something I can push off or set my own schedule for.

EDIT 2: just to clarify, the issue isn’t about childcare or work around the house. It’s that my wife and kid tends to get bored around the house and when I’m home it’s registered as “play time” instead of work time. So they’re not coming in to ask me to do dishes or clean the house, they’re asking me to watch Netflix with them or play with the dogs, etc. 

Obviously I’d love to play with them too but I really can’t during my working hours. It’s not like I’d personally rather sit in front of my computer than play with my daughter or cook with my wife.",1126,6038,0.97,AITA for locking the door to my home office and refusing to let my daughter and wife visit during the workday?,g5q3yf,2020-04-21 23:21:43,NTA,2951,AITA
20034,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory on mobile, excuse format. 
I’m 19f, and my mom is a 50f. We’ve always been pretty close most of my life and even more so now that I’m an adult. My mom has struggled with her weight since her late 30’s (she had me at 31), it’s a lot to do with 3 autoimmune diseases, and a couple other medical issues. Her weight has fluctuated a lot over the past 20 years and I know it bothers her because growing up I would hear comments from her about herself often. I think she’s absolutely gorgeous, always has been (she even modeled in her teens), and so does my stepdad. She’s not huge at all but is overweight. Because of her comments about (only) herself, I developed a lot of insecurity about my own weight from a young age. I was never big at all but I focused a lot on myself and thought I was ugly or bigger than I was. It was definitely a source of extreme depression in my younger teens. I’m a lot more confident now about my body and while I’m definitely not thin, I’m not big either (considered curvy? I guess). My mom has never put me down but lately I’ve been slowly losing weight just from change in eating habits and doing more exercise. She makes comments a lot that I look thinner or asks if I lost weight. Usually these would be great comments but losing weight isn’t my goal, being healthy is. I don’t weigh myself because it only makes me obsess about it. I know she means well but from her comments, I start to focus more on my actual weight and if I feel bloated some days then it makes me insecure because “I don’t look thinner anymore” (my words, not hers). I worked hard on overcoming insecurities the past few years and getting better mentally, but even well-meaning comments make me look at myself with a less positive light.

12657,Not the A-hole,"Disclaimer: I found out about this sub through watching Cuestar on YouTube and thought it could be a good place to take this issue. I've never used or even really browsed Reddit before, so sorry if I get anything wrong. 

So here's my situation. My mother and I have never really seen eye to eye. We just have wildly different worldviews. Our rocky relationship hit its peak when I was 17 and came out as gay. She kicked me out and we didn't speak for three years. We reconnected about a year ago and, while I didn't move back in, our relationship is a bit more stable than it was previously. 

Throughout my teenage years, I would get pretty sick almost every time I ate and as a result, didn't eat a lot and was pretty underweight. Since leaving my mum's house, I've made several lifestyle changes and concluded that I'm probably lactose intolerant, as the sickness after eating went away after I cut out dairy. Thing is, Mum doesn't believe me. She thinks my boyfriend (who is vegan) is ""brainwashing"" me into thinking dairy is poison and accuses me of having an eating disorder. The comments I can brush off, but the issue comes with food she makes. She *always* manages to sneak dairy products into somehow, as if she's trying to ""catch me out"". The one time she witnessed me being sick after eating something she'd snuck quite a lot of milk into, she accused me of forcing myself to vomit. She did say she would stop doing it, but I know she hasn't because I *still* get sick every time I eat at her house. I've asked if I can just bring my own food and she said no, so I've just stopped eating at her house. 

My stepdad, my grandparents and my aunt have all text me to tell me how offended my mum is and how much of a difficult brat I'm being. I've tried explaining that dairy makes me sick and she keeps sneaking it into my food. I've essentially been told that if I want to have a relationship with my mother, I need to suck it up and stop being so selfish and think of her feelings. Are they right, or should I stick to my gut?

ETA: okay this got more response than I was expecting haha. Just wanted to clear up something I thought I'd added, but forgot to (sorry!) Mum has told my family that I have, essentially, an eating disorder (i.e. I'm making myself vomit after eating), and that I'm using allergies as an excuse. They aren't the type to really take mental health issues seriously, especially when it's a man having them, which is why I was told to ""suck it up"". Obviously telling someone to ""suck up"" a mental illness is no better than doing it with a physical one, but I just wanted to clear that up as I forgot to include it originally.",363,1474,0.94,AITA for refusing to eat at my mother's house?,boiqyr,2019-05-14 13:11:45,NTA,2659,AITA
20146,Not the A-hole,"Ok so, first off I’m on mobile so forgive me for formatting.

When my sister was 1 year old, my parents didn’t want her in their bed anymore and she was eager to sleep in mine so my parents let her share a bed with me; I was 12 at the time.According to my parents I wouldn’t sleep by myself until I was 3 years old, so I figured that they would help me introducer her to sleep on her own when the time came.

Also, she already had her own room, with a crib that was I believe appropriate for 0-5 year olds. It was one of those cribs that you could rebuild into a proper bed. So basically, my parents had prepared in advance for my sister to learn.

However skip 5 years and my sister, now almost 7, is still sleeping in my bed. I am almost 18 and about to start uni in September. Many times during these last years, I wanted to sleep by myself since I feel uncomfortable being a teen, almost an adult, and still having to share a bed with her. I wanted a room for myself again where I could stay up late if I had to in order to complete homework and research.

Whenever I try talking to my parents about this, they always shut me down and said “It would be worse if she didn’t want to sleep with you because it would mean that she doesn’t like you.”. They think I’m selfish for wanting to “kick” my sister out of my bed, despite the fact that we already have a bed for her. She’s never even used it except from when she was a baby.

I have tried taking matters into my own hands many times.
I’d stay in her room and sit next to her until she fell asleep in her own bed- that never worked- she just wanted to go to sleep in my room.
When she fell asleep in my bed, I’d pick her up and take her to her own bed. She’d always come back to my room in the middle of the night.
I’d leave a nightlight on in her room and have her try to sleep with her favourite teddies so she wouldn’t feel alone, that also never worked.

Now, my parents are frustrated that when I go to sleep early, I don’t take my sister up to my room with me. They’re frustrated by my questions of when my sister will be able to sleep by herself and they call me ungrateful for not wanting to share my bed.

I just don’t understand why I’m being ignored in this situation, AITA?

Edit: I’m staying home when I go to uni and I’ll be doing day and night shifts at a hospital.
Getting a lock for my door isn’t an option. My sister starts banging and screaming when I lean against the door so she can’t come in when I’m getting changed. It’s really embarrassing because mum gets angry and starts yelling “what you have is what she has and it’s no different than mine.” I feel hopeless.

I’m going to be in contact with the police today, so I’ll maybe update again in a few weeks to let you know what has happened.

7499,Not the A-hole,"In summer 2008 I met my ex-wife. She had two boys, who were two and three years old. When she got pregnant with twins I raised these boys as my own.

In February 2018, she left, leaving the boys and my own twins in my home. As we moved through the divorce process, I kept all four kids with me. I never adopted the boys and have no legal parental rights over the boys.

In the divorce, I gained primary custody of my twins, who are now ten years old. They visit their mom every other weekend. The boys are not listed anywhere in the parenting plan.

In September of 2018, the oldest stepson, 13, bucked my authority when he didn’t like the consequences for one of his actions. His words were “You’re not my dad. I don’t have to listen to you. I want to move to my mom’s. 

I asked him to take a few weeks before he made this decision, so that the decision was not made in an emotional state. For the next three weeks I discussed with him the ramifications of the decision. I explained that his mom was living with her new boyfriend, and that he might not like the living situation when he got there. This also meant moving to a neighboring state, changing schools, friends, doctors, etc. I explained to him that in life, the decisions we make often have far-reaching consequences. During this time I made the decision that if he were to move, I wouldn’t let him move back, because I wanted to teach him that our decisions in life have repercussions. I explained to him that he couldn’t just leave there and come back when he didn’t like a situation.

He chose to move anyway, but his younger brother stayed with me.

In early June of this summer, my ex-wife informed me that she would be having her other son move in with her at the end of summer. Then, the first week of July she changed her mind and moved him up that week.

Yesterday, the oldest, now 14, called me and asked if he could move in with me. When I asked his mother she said she would be ok with that. She then proceeded to tell me the other son, who moved out against his will, also wanted to move back.

Both sons still come visit me on my weekends with the kids. I take them both on outings, backpacking, hiking, shooting, and camping. I have maintained my role of father in their life, despite all of the challenges that come with that. 

I feel like I might be the asshole because part of me doesn’t want to allow them to move back in. My house has become incredibly calm and stable since they left. The younger children are thriving. The two boys are not my biological children. Their mother has never offered any child support or financial assistance in raising them. 

TLDR; I continued to raise two boys as my own after the divorce, who were not my biological sons. Circumstances have led to them moving back to their moms.

At this point, I had just started my university studies, and my university had a strict attendance policy, where as 2 weeks with no absence lead to automatic withdrawal from your course. I then decided, with upcoming coursework and exams, I would not be attending as one of her bridesmaids.

I had a very civil conversation with my dad, and he understood my reasonings, and assured me it was a very mature decision for me to make.

She started ignoring me, basically dismissing my attendance in a room. I started paying rent for food, and she'd cook me dinner, but that was it.

About a year into this,I had got home from university, she slammed the bathroom door closed, and shouted something like ""ugh what disgusting humans"".

I packed a bag, called my aunt and asked if I could come stay for a couple days. I text my dad, told him what she had said on Facebook, and I concluded it must have been about me because I was the only one home with her at this point.

He asked me to come home, I said I was going to stay here until Sunday night,, but he best be assured I was livid at this point and didn't want to see her smug face. He spoke to her this weekend, and said it wasn't about me, it was about a colleague at work, and she is sorry.

I walked up to her while she was on her desk, I said the words ""Happy Birthday, I have a present for you"" and the ignorant being she is, did NOT even turn around to take the present from me, she simply said ""Just leave it there"" and kept working. I was MAD. I dropped the present on that table and to this day I refuse to make an effort with her anymore. She out right ignored my attempt at a truce and I concluded she must be the person with a stick up her arse. I was 20 at this point, I was an adult, but this woman was 35, being so ignorant to her step-daughter. I was mature enough to make an effort and she threw it in my face.

The only thing that makes some sense is that she is upset I didn't go to the wedding, but it doesn't mean I didn't approve of it.

6879,Not the A-hole,"I'm getting married in less than 2 months. My fiancee and I are trying to do things as low-cost as possible while still keeping things classy. Our thought was that we didn't really want anyone there that we didn't know since it's more of a ""close friends and family"" reception. Realistically, the only people who get a +1 are friends because they may not know anyone in my family and I wouldn't want them to feel uncomfortable.   

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My mom asked about 4 months ago if she could bring her best friend as a +1. I do not like my mom's best friend. She causes drama everywhere she goes, and she especially doesn't like my dad. I said she couldn't. My mom does not have a significant other that she could bring in her place.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My dad has, on his own volition, covered a significant amount of the wedding costs because he is employed well-enough to do so, and my mom has not contributed any money to the cost of the wedding. This is okay with us because we initially weren't going to rely on anyone else for wedding costs. Also, since my mom makes less money than I do, it wasn't a thought in my mind to expect her or ask her to cover the cost of anything in our wedding. The reason I bring this up is because my mom's best friend will somehow twist my dad's generous act of covering the some of the costs into a negative thing. The two of them would sit there and talk negatively about my dad and his fiancee during the reception. Throw in alcohol, and the two of them would draw lots of attention to themselves and put my dad in an embarrassing spot (especially in front of my fiancee's family who has not met anyone in my family yet since they live halfway across the country). I know this would happen because it's happened before on numerous occasions.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So yesterday my fiancee and I sent out our wedding invitations. Mom asked me today about bringing her best friend again, and I said, ""No. I told you before that I do not want her there."" My grandma tried to reason with me and say, ""Let her bring her friend,"" to which my response was, ""It's my wedding. I can decide who I want there and who I don't want there."" My mom actually started crying and then said something to the effect of, ""I was really hoping I would be able to bring my friend and her boyfriend."" I said, ""Mom. Now you're asking for 2 guests? We have to pay for everyone's food and we have to solidify guest numbers. We only have so many seats. We can't afford to pay for more people."" Then she asked, ""What if I have a boyfriend by the time the wedding comes around."" I said, ""We wouldn't know him and we don't want anyone we don't know at the wedding. Also, It's a cost thing too.""   

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My mom asked me how many of my dad and step-mom's friends were going. I said, ""Two, because they gave us a bunch of money at our surprise engagement party and we felt obligated to invite them.""

15754,Asshole,"So I (30M) got married 2 years ago to (28F). Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.

Now I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. 

Anyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. 

She seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. 

So when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. 

It's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (30F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?

8180,Not the A-hole,"I got surgery on my throat on July 11th, and since then I have been in a lot of pain, doped up on painkillers, and unable to eat. As a result of not eating I have become very weak, and start to feel faint and see black spots in my vision when walking from one room to another. The Sunday following my surgery my mom ran our dishwasher and got our trash & recycle ready to be picked up in the morning. It is my job to empty the dishwasher and take down the trash. If the dishwasher is run and I'm not home for a few days, my mom will typically just leave it for me to empty until I return, which is fine, but still a bit annoying. But I get it. They're my chores. On this particular Sunday I was in a lot of pain, at one point violently throwing up bile onto my freshly cauterized throat, sobbing into a trashcan. My mom tries to offer me food (to prepare for this surgery she bought me only 2 foods. A giant family sized portion of mac and cheese and lemon flavored popsicles that I can't eat) I tell her I cannot eat. She asks why am I making this so difficult for everyone.Throughout the week my godmother has taken care of me and my mom has offered pretty much nothing, she hasn't been checking to make sure I'm eating or taking medication or choking on my own blood. Flash forward to today. The dishes from last week are still in the dishwasher. The trash was not taken down and it has been 100+ degrees all week. I told my mom that I was not going to empty the dishwasher because it is fucked up she wouldn't do it while I was sick, plus they're not even my dishes, I haven't been eating. She is very upset with me, and I do not care. Throughout the entire process of surgery, she has been nothing but a hindrance to me, she almost made me not get important medication I needed the day before I was to get surgery, did not get buy anything for me to eat (she went out and bought a bunch of things that SHE can eat), and has told me that I am a nuisance while I experienced the most intense pain I have felt in my entire life. It goes past just not wanting to empty the stupid fucking dishwasher, it's the fact that she couldn't even do something as simple as put a few of HER dishes away while I'm suffering. I think my mother may be on the autism spectrum, so explaining things to her rationally doesn't really work. We argued for a while on the phone today and I think she understands that she's being shitty, but now it's become a pride thing. She h a t e s admitting that she is wrong. I explained to her that she has done absolutely nothing for me during this process and brought up examples and she was very quiet and crying.

Backstory.  My husband (41) and myself (36F) have been married for 6 years now.  He has a younger brother who is my age who is getting married this fall.   They aren’t particularly close as there is an age difference and they are two very different people.  No ill will.  Just no relationship.   BIL calls when he need something (literally without fail)  but otherwise it is all communication via text.  For example a text was sent along the lines of “hey bro, if you want to be one of my groomsmen, you can. Let me know.”  Yeah, um we are wedding-ed out.  No thanks.  We don’t feel the need to live up to the expectations of others when there is not a relationship the other 364 days of the year.   All for photos and the proper image being displayed.  We dislike the pomp and circumstance.  We are fine attending of course but that’s the extent of participation.   We will enjoy the time with the cousins as they are close.   

We already have an expensive flight not to mention the resort is $400 + per night..,plus use  of hard earned PTO.  Which we cherish like gold coins.   

Now details have very slowly been released.  It’s on a need-to-know basis despite questions having been asked.  

Today, it gets texted that my husband will walk their mother down the aisle.  FIL is present and available.  My husband walked my MIL down the aisle at our wedding.  

It’s BIL’s wedding and I thought proper etiquette is for the groom is do to this.  

My husband told BIL that he should escort their mother or their father should, but that he was escorting his wife - his date (me).  BIL protested.  Husband didn’t back down.

Are we the assholes? No one’s the asshole? Everyone’s the asshole? 

Note it is a wedding in the great outdoors.  No set religious aspect (all raised Catholic but no longer practicing).  

BIL will be going down with his groomsmen or something like that.   

I’m pretty irritated but came to the great world of reddit for thoughts/opinions/advice.


*update - I/we (husband has read comments all as well) appreciate the insights and perspectives.  Tough crowd (gulp!). but we see the viewpoint.  Husband texted BIL and said if it was his request then yes, and sorry for being difficult.   He also asked where their father would be.  BIL responded with “already seated or perhaps he could walk with (my name here).”  That’s fair.  I’m fine already being seated.

20822,Not the A-hole,"I know it sounds bad, but context is everything. 

My friend Emily is staying with my husband and I for a week. She was evicted from her apartment after an incident with her ex boyfriend, and she had just two weeks until her new lease started and nowhere to go, so she's staying on our apartment. 

One of the houserules I gave her was no visitors/partners. Emily is poly, and she has 5 current partners, and when I told her none would be able to visit (as I am an asthmatic and am trying to stay safe) there was a lot of complaining. Twice she compared her experience of me not allowing a visit from her partners to homophobia, which pissed me off because I'm queer and she's straight, and that's a hell of a thing to accuse a queer person of. Well ignored her, because I feel like it's my house, my rules. In two weeks (only 5 days left!) she can resume life as normal. 

Next came the ""discussions"" as to why monogamy is ""morally wrong"". These happen almost every night at dinner, when my husband and I have finished a long day of work. We are at our dinner table and have to be lectured by a houseguest as to why monogamous relationships defy nature, how they're all destined to fail in a pile of cheating and jealousy, and how much more enlightened poly is. I have no problem with poly, but I just see it as a preference, not an inherently better relationship model. 

We ignored that behavior as well. She broke us last night however. For some reason I was feeling sweet(probably all the wine I had), and decided to pull out my wedding album (I know, dumb choice to make with Emily there, as I now see in retrospect). I was looking through pictures with her, and I pointed out that the ceremony pic is my favorite because it's just super cute and she says ""yeah it's cute, but it's kind of a lie to promise a lifetime to someone. It's just not realistic."" 

Well I blew up. I told her to ""keep your polyamory shit to yourself or find somewhere else to sleep for free."" I then went to my room, slammed the door, and cried. I haven't spoken to her since. 

My husband is on my side, he's been sick of the lectures from her, especially considering how often Emily texts us ""SOS bad breakup, let's get drinks"".

15355,Not the A-hole,"I stopped talking to my mom 4 years ago and recently stopped talking to my dad. I stopped talking to my mom because she would lie about me. For example, my mom and my dad separated and my mom called me trying to get me to extort my dad for money (for her). When I refused, she threatened to call the cops on me for fraud that I did not commit, so I told her to ""go ahead"", hung up and haven't spoken to her since. She has then gone around telling family that she has no clue why I'm not speaking to her and that she did nothing wrong to deserve my desertion. The truth is my mom has been threatening me as a method to control me since I was a child. In fact, she used to threaten to 'off herself' as a means to control me and when I was 12 she actually attempted in front of me.  

My dad has recently gotten back together with my mom and has started trying to manipulate me. He ""bought"" me a vehicle for $500 but I insured it and HE drove it (he couldn't insure a vehicle because he has too many fines). He got speeding and parking tickets with said vehicle (which was under my name) and did not pay for them. The vehicle broke down, my dad brought it back to my place where it stayed, broken down in my parking spot. My landlord told me to get rid of it if it's not working. I told my dad. Nothing. His fines went to collections and went on my credit report, ruining my credit score. I'm trying to save up to buy a house and keeping a good credit score is paramount. So I call an autowrecker, who pays me $500 to take the vehicle away, just enough to cover the fines. I pay the fines off.

Fast forward a few months and my dad shows up wanting the vehicle. I told him that I sold it to pay for the fines he got. He's angry but doesn't say anything and leaves. He and my mother then go and tell my entire family that I have sold his car out from under him and took the money.

Edit: I have stopped talking to them. My family thinks I am the asshole and is pressuring me to stop ""being a bitch to the people that raised and loved you"". Honestly...

Since piano is too expensive I got her an electronic keyboard and signed her up for 6 months of keyboard lessons. The deal I made with her was that she was not allowed to give it up before 6 months and to practice 20 minutes a day, she agreed without thinking.


It turned out just as I expected, she got bored of it after 2 months and asked to stop the lessons. Ofcourse I turned it down and reminded her about our deal. She then started to make excuses to skip practice from time to time, often requiring me to remind her to practice extra time to make up for the times she skipped.


There is an upcoming school trip for my daughter and she is looking forward to it, it is a 3 days 2 nights trip. I told her that she can only go if she cleared the keyboard practice time she skipped previously. I can give her a break by not counting in the 3 days school trip, but even so she still has to practice the keyboard 1 hour a day to clear them all before the date.


She threw a fit after I made it clear that if she could not clear the practice time, she would not be going. My husband said that since we've already paid for the trip and she was looking forward to it, threatening to cancel it over keyboard practice is too harsh.

I've always had a good relationship with my parents, and when I told them my gf was pregnant with my daughter 2 years ago, they were overjoyed. When my daughter was born, my dad looked at her like I've never seen him look at anyone. He was completely besotted.

Cut to three months later and my mum is diagnosed with cancer. It's a big thing, but we stay strong and we work through it.

A month after this, my mum finds out that my dad has been cheating on her. She came home one day and he was sat on the sofa covered in love bites. He wanted to be caught clearly, easier than having the hard conversation. Not only that, but he started cheating on her a week after she was diagnosed with cancer. He was actively looking - we found his online dating profile listing him as 'single', created a week after the diagnosis. He has decided to do this when my mum needed him the most, and then spent all of his time with this new woman, refusing to take my mum for her chemo or help around the house. He used the house like a hotel, stopping for food and sleep before he went back out with her.

Once he'd been caught he announced that this woman was the love of his life, and that he was excited to start his new life with his new family (she has two daughters). My sister was understandably angry as he's never really shown her much affection.

Since then he's become this horrible person, telling people that my mum was 'overexaggerating' the cancer for attention, and more. We also found out that he'd been using prostitutes for a number of years, and that he'd been fired from several jobs for stealing when he told us he'd moved jobs of his own volition.

I immediately decided to cut him out of my life. I dont want that kind of person around my children. I have a son now too, who will never meet my dad as long as I have any say over it.

19451,Asshole,"Sorry for any errors, English isn’t my first language

So my husband (29M) and I (26M) have been married for almost 2 years, and since the moment my husband introduced me to his family, they have hated me because I used to bully his sister (26F).
For the sake of this post I will call her Liz.

Before I get into the events, I want to make it clear that I deeply regret my actions and am very ashamed of my behaviour. I am no longer the person I was back then.

Back when I was 13, I used to bully Liz who was 12/13 at the time. I made fun of her physical features, I used to call her a man due to her sideburns, call her fat and would often get my friends to join in. I know from the way I’m writing this, it may seem like I lack empathy but at the time my father died and mother married an abusive man. I was a very angry and bitter person and I took it all out on Liz, who didn’t deserve to be treated so badly. 

This carried on for 5/6 months until her father called the school to report me. I was very popular and had several people back me up and so the matter was dropped. I got away with the bullying but after being reported I did stop. However that didn’t stop other people from attacking her and she became an outcast in my school for being a snitch. She left the school shortly afterwards. My husband was attending a boarding school and so wasn’t there at the time. 

Now when my husband introduced me to his family, Liz recognized me. After our first meeting, his family gave him an ultimatum me or them. He knew my past and that I was a changed person so he picked me. They immediately cut him off, and kicked him out of the house and even took him out of the will.
His parents hate him, since they blame me for putting Liz through so much pain

In fact at our wedding not one single member of his family attended, which truly recked him. All his cousins, aunts and uncles want nothing do with him, since they see his actions as a betrayal against family.
 I have profusely apologized to Liz, many times but she told me she hopes I rot in hell. 

Anyways a few days ago, my husband was scrolling through Facebook and found out that Liz had gotten married and everyone from his family was there. My husband had a very close relationship with his sister, she was the first person he came out to, they loved each other very much.However, due to him being with to me, they haven’t spoken in almost 5 years. He tried to contact to his sister and instead got a very angry email telling him to f*** off. My husband has been trying to reconnect with his family for a very long time and after being rejected so many times, I got tired of seeing so hurt and told him that he should just give up and move on. He understood, but mutual friends have said that I’m an Asshole for telling him to give up when I caused the problem in the first place

I could see she wasn't our usual type as soon as she walked in. She was very pretty and very well spoken, and seemed fairly nice on her first day. However, within her first week she proved to be very lazy. She was constantly at the back chatting to some of the other girls or flirting with the guys in the kitchen. She was OK with the cashier work but if I asked her to do something like sweep/mop the floor she'd ''Ugh'' and give me a dirty look, but she had no choice but to get it done. 

I did some digging on her. Googled her name and the first thing that came up was her linked in profile. She's been to one of the best unis and had a job doing financial stuff for some big company. I wondered why someone that smart with a career like that would end up working here. 

I chatted to one of the other girls to see what she knew about Megan. Apparently she was fired because she turned up to work blatantly under the influence of drugs. She was tested, and as a result was not only fired but also blacklisted from the profession with her specialist certifications voided. According to Amy (the girl I spoke to) her parents made her get this job by threatening to kick her out.

Yesterday Megan kicked off at me in the crew room for making her mop the floor again. I didn't understand what the problem was but she kept saying that I only made her do it because I was too lazy to do it myself. That isn't true at all and I kept trying to tell her that I had to both do my own work and ensure that she gets the right training. She then tried to get at me by saying that in a few months she'd be gone and I'd still be here. We argued for a bit until she said that she wouldn't apologise for being prettier and smarter and more successful than me so I should ''get off my high horse''. I responded that if she was so smart then she shouldn't have gone and ruined her own career. 

Once I said this she got upset and went off to get changed. Her shift was over but when she stepped out she was clearly crying. When she was gone some of the others in the room started to get at me saying I shouldn't have brought up her previous job and that she's new so shouldn't be thrown in at the deep end. 

I don't regret standing up for myself against her but I think bringing up her last job was a low blow?",18,44,0.98,AITA for bringing up a bad memory for a new colleague?,c3pdk3,2019-06-22 12:55:18,ESH,2623,AITA
1503,Not the A-hole,"Full disclosure, I don't get along with my half sister.  She's 40, single, and with no kids.  I had been living with her rent free when I moved in with her years ago and got my gf pregnant.  She's always wanted a kid and refused to talk to me when she found out and then kicked me out.  She even admitted it is was due to her own issues.  Ever since then I haven't been a big fan.  I understand she was definitely helping me out by letting me stay there for free and having a kid in there wouldn't have been good.  The way it went down left a bad taste in my mouth and there have been some other issues in the past.  I mention this so that I don't come off all innocent and I know stories can be one-sided.  I definitely have bad feelings about it all and I'm just not the biggest fan.  

To get to the AITA.  For some reason every year she wants to pay for a photo shoot for my daughter on her birthday.  It's very weird to me but I go along with it to keep my parents happy who want her involved in everything. My own father can't even send a photo of my daughter without her being included in the group chat.  If she's left out when I send something he always says, ""why isn't your sister involved?  You know she likes these photos."" Everything from him has to have her included in the family group chat. 

Anyway, this year I didn't think we were doing it because no one said anything.  Whew!!  Wrong.  I got a text a week or two ago asking about it.  My babies mama and I normally go with her on these photo shoots but this year she's requesting to do it on her own and surprise us since it can't be on a weekend.  She had originally mentioned a Friday and I told her fine.  Now today she says Thursday and asks if that would work.  My GF and I don't live together right now and I always pick her up on Thursday and get to spend time with her after being away.  

So, I said, maybe we should do it next month when there's more availability.  After all, she did ask.  I told her she'd get home too late since it's starts at 4pm, she'd pick her up at like 1-2pm which is when I get her and make sure she's ready by 4pm and by the time she got here(7-730pm) it would be time to put her to sleep.  I'd get one hour.  After not seeing my daughter for 4 days Thursdays are my favorite because I get to see her after her being away.  

Well, apparently saying that made me a horrible person and I have both of my parents telling me I'm trying to keep her from my daughter.  Apparently her mother called my father saying she cried all the way home.  So...now I'm the horrible person. To be honest, I don't even like these photo shoots.  I'd love for them to stop, but I do it to be nice.

9771,Asshole,"I started a job for the summer a few weeks ago, and I commute each morning via bus. I always take the same bus at the same time and it's always been ""on-time"" at least within a 1-2 minute  window. Yesterday, I was waiting at the bus stop and checking an app that lets me know when the next bus will be here, and the time jumped from 2min away to 6min away (which is not unusual because the app is pretty unreliable). I thought that was a little suspicious but I wasn't too concerned because a 4 min delay would still let me get to work on time.

Anyways, the bus driver ends up being 9min late (which is hilarious, since the bus comes around every 10min so the next bus would be there in the next minute or so). I thought to myself that maybe there was a small issue that explained why the bus was held up for so long, but I didn't think much of it until the bus driver started driving: And I realized the driver was incredibly slow, going about a 1/3 of the speed that previous bus drivers have/cars around us were (below the speed limit). In addition, he wouldn't leave a stop until everyone who had boarded the bus was seated (which I understand is appropriate for some passengers, e.g. elderly, disabled, young kids). Midway through the ride, I realized if this driver kept his pace, I would be uncomfortably late for work, and so I went up to him and told him, ""Sir, do you mind driving a little more quickly? My work day starts at 8."" I said it with a smile and tried to say it in a calm/friendly way because I know it was selfish and I didn't want to sound high-brow/arrogant  (but I was pretty anxious so I'm not sure how it sounded). After I said that, the driver just shot me a glare and told me to get seated.

This normally is never an issue, because the bus always gets to the stop near my workplace at least 10 minutes before 8, but with this driver's pace, I would be uncharacteristically late. So what normally is a 12-15min bus ride ended up taking a whopping 25min which I've never experienced in my 3 weeks of commuting to work. In addition, the usual rotation of bus drivers always drive uncomfortably fast (but within the speed limit), to the point that I always have to grab a rail as soon as they take off or else I'll fall to the ground.

Yes, I understand that this is one experience in a whole lifetime/planet of human experiences, so me being worried about being late to work is inconsequential in the long-run; and yes, I'm aware that unfortunate things happen sometimes outside of our control. But because I don't want to develop a bad reputation in my office since I'm still starting out/in my probationary period, being on-time is important; and usually, I'm hit with a wall of work from my manager once I walk into the office, so being there on-time allows the rest of the office to function (in some way).

AITA for making this request?

tl;dr Bus driver drives unexpectedly slow, so I asked him to speed up.

EDIT: I've taken this same bus at the same time to work since my first day and it always gets me there 10-15min before my work day. This day was a random occurrence where I took the same bus at the same time and ended up being late.  


EDIT2: I don't live in a huge city like LA/NY but it's about a 30-40min drive from the metropolitan area.",74,48,0.85,AITA For Telling the Bus Driver to Drive More Quickly,c6lhxj,2019-06-28 15:24:01,YTA,3285,AITA
11071,Not the A-hole,"[Map and photos](https://imgur.com/a/4Xi7U4L)

We moved to our current house a little over a year ago. We are on the end of a cul-de-sac. Our lot is shaped oddly, and it borders an apartment complex. There is a tall hedge, but unfortunately it does not completely extend along the property line.

Over time, we've noticed people using our yard as a shortcut to get from the apartment complex to our cul-de-sac and then presumably from there to the grocery stores and restaurants nearby. On the map, the yellow arrows are the routes people are taking through our yard.

Am I wrong for feeling this is unnecessary and needs to stop? We have 3 small children, and I don't like the idea of strangers walking through my back yard just because they can't be bothered to walk an extra block along the street.

Additionally, what can I do? I'm not great with confronting people, but I've come up with a few ideas:

1. Set up Wyze cameras and do *something* with the footage (send it to the police, post it on YouTube, idk?)

2. Put up ""No Trespassing"" signs. Would this actually work, or just make the trespassers mad and make things worse?

3. Try to give Gospel tracts to anyone who walks through and ask them if they're heard the Good News. (We're Christians. Mennonites to be exact so I'm pretty good at being passive-aggressive. )

4. Put up a fence.

18339,Asshole,"My ex-husband and I have been separated for a year now and I had recently seen on facebook that my step daughter had joined the military and was very excited about it. 

This confused me because she's been diagnosed with depression and anxiety a couple years ago, and I was under the impression the military did not take people like that in. 

I messaged her and asked her if she had disclosed her previous mental illnesses to the military. She said she hadn't because she knew she would not have been let in even though she felt ""fine"" now. 

I called her recruiter and told him that she has a history of mental illness that she did not disclose. I was doing this out of worry for her. If the military finds out she lied, she could go to prison. He told me he would talk to me step daughter about it. 

The next day, she calls me and was very upset on the phone. She asked me why would I ever say that and put her future in jeopardy. I told her that SHE was the one putting her future in jeopardy by lying to the US government! She said some very vile things to me and that was the last I've heard of her.

3971,Not the A-hole,"So, as a preface this happened last month. Also, my first post:I went camping with a few friends that were in town. We were camping for one night and hiking the next day. There were 5 of us total, me and two couples. We all decided that we would let one person buy all the food and split the food costs evenly. This was one dinner meal, one breakfast meal, some snacks, and beer. When we arrived (I should also note, I drove 3 hours each way in my car in the Rocky Mountains) I asked the friend who purchased the food, lets call him James, how much I owed them in the split, and they said evenly it would be $50.

Now, I'm no scrooge and I'm always happy to pay my fair share, but I felt that this was a little steep considering we were eating burgers, pancakes, and drinking coors lite for only one night. I asked to see a receipt. Turns out, the bill for everything was $150, and we just had a lot of nicer products. Jame's wife is a vegetarian and had her own separate food included in the bill, and I'm happy to help with her food as well, but it definitely added to the cost.Here is where I take issue. The bill was split 3 ways, 1/3 James and his wife, 1/3 the other couple, 1/3 me by myself. My wife was not with us because she had to work, and I felt that it was unfair that I was expected to cover 1/3 the bill while the other two paid ""as a couple"" instead of individually.

I was bothered by this and brought it up, explaining that it wasn't exactly even, but I was told by both couples that it made sense to them. Their logic was because James was paying, and the other male was paying, the women shouldn't have to. Normally, I'd be chivalrous and agree, but my wife wasn't there, so I don't think that it makes sense. I offered to pay $30, which would have been 1/5 the costs instead of 1/3, but they all said I was being ridiculous.

Am I the asshole for not agreeing with this split?

21091,Asshole,"Long story short, my ex's brother and I were co workers (how I met my ex). As much as we worked well together and had some bant, we weren't close at all and weren't friends which is why I was shocked to get a call from him four weeks ago asking if I could take care of his shih tzu while he went to the hospital. Apparently he'd called all his friends but they were either anti dog or didn't have the space for one and I was his last option so I said yes. I'd prefer not to go into the reasons of his hospital visit or his death but the point is he died a week later. Still sad even though we didn't know each other well. His funeral was last week but I couldn't go because it was at his parent's (out of town). I didn't really think about what would happen to the dog until his sister (my ex) called last night asking if I still have the dog and basically said she was coming to town this week to fetch her. The problem is, I've really bonded with this dog. Like I wasn't really a dog person but damn she really made her way into my heart. She's just playful and a great dog all in all. Even my girlfriend has gotten attached to her. So I apologised but said I wanted to keep the dog. She lost it and gave me a rant about how the dog was first their mums but then it was given to him so the dog should go back to the family. I'm almost 100% sure that her brother knew he was going to die when he gave her to me to look after. I feel like she's my responsibility now.

14481,Not the A-hole,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 5 years. We live together and do not want kids. He says he’s fine with not getting married, but lately the topic of marriage has been increasingly popping up - at his prompting. I am quite open about my feelings about marriage (not opposed, but what’s the point?), but lately I have come to the realization that I don’t think I could handle my income becoming part of a “household income.”

I make almost 3 times as much as my boyfriend. No judgements on my end - he chose a field he was passionate about, and I chose one that would pay me a lot of money. Neither is wrong, in my opinion. I think he’s generally okay with it and is okay with contributing about half (closer to 40%) to our current expenses. 

My problem is that he’s kind of irresponsible with his money. He mostly pays his bills on time but almost lives paycheck to paycheck because he has expensive habits like gambling (any sports fantasy possible, lotto entires, scratch offs, casino visits), and smoking both weed and cigarettes. He has no retirement savings, a small emergency fund (maybe a few hundred), and I get the feeling that his impulse control is quite poor. 

My worst spending habit would probably be my exorbitantly expensive barre and yoga classes, but as the daughter of a wealth management advisor, I’ve always been financially savvy and have four different types of savings accounts. I know not everyone has that same financial education, so I try not to hold his spending habits against him too much (while suggesting ways he can put his money to better use). 

I’m fine with him spending his own money on those things, but I wouldn’t want to get married and have my money in anyway go towards what I consider bad habits. I love my boyfriend very much and think he’s a kind, compassionate person. Our relationship is heathy, and he makes me happy. I know if the roles were reversed, he would never feel the same way. However, I fear that you would resent him if he continued his spending habits into our marriage. I’d ruin this awesome thing we have. 

So, am I the asshole for keeping marriage off the table because I’m worried I would resent him if he spent my money the way he spends his?

So I’m a 16 year old girl and I live with my mom and my younger sister (11). My mom is a single mom and we kind of live paycheck to paycheck. We always have food in the fridge (even if it’s something that we don’t particularly want) and the only time we really don’t have food is when my mom is waiting for her next check, and even then, this is a rare occurrence.


Anyways, I also got a little part time job and I was able to bring home a decent amount of money (for a teenager anyways) home. Even though we had no formal agreement, I’d always try to give my mom $50 or $100 every paycheck just to help out a bit. She’s never actually told me to give up some money because she says that I’ve earned it, but she’s still grateful and I’m glad to help..


So one day, we were having one of “those days” at home where the only things in the fridge were yogurts and stuff like that, and maybe some crackers in the pantry. My sister I guess is at that age where she gets picky with her food and doesn’t really want to eat that, and would prefer to have something like chicken nuggets. I was at work and I knew that we didn’t have much food at home left, so before I came home, I stopped by McDonald’s and picked myself up a meal because I was able to afford some food for myself without “breaking my budget” that I gave myself for fast food every month.

She’ll binge watch her favourite tv shows for several seasons (30+ episodes) and not be able to name a single character. Even if you ask who her favourite is, she’ll wait for the character to come on and say “her”.
Her parent-teacher interviews this year and last were bad. I don’t have details cause all my sister told me was “the teacher doesn’t like her, that’s why it went badly.”

Aside from this, she seems like a typical 7 year old kid in terms of how she socializes and plays. FWIW the kid says she likes school because her friends are there.

16412,Not the A-hole,"Shortly after boarding for a 2 1/2 hour flight home, I was approached by a steward who asked me if would mind swapping seats with another passenger.

I asked where his seat was, and he told me that it was about 8 rows back and a middle seat.

I told him that I'd prefer not to, since I was in an aisle seat and had paid extra (not much, about $20) for the ""economy plus"" section that gave me additional leg room.

The steward said that is why he wanted to swap seats, the other passenger was taller than I.

I mentioned that regardless, I had paid for the extra leg room and booked early to get the aisle seat.

He responded that he'd give me some free drinks to make up for it to which I replied, no thank you, buy I don't drink.  

He continues to push me on it saying how uncomfortable the other passenger would be.  Finally the pressure, and frankly the slight embarrassment of this continued conversation / confrontation got the best of me and I gave in.

I was pretty steamed the whole ride, and when I got home I called the airline and complained about the situation and about the steward, by name.

In retrospect I feel a bit bad.  What I should have done was just said stood my ground and stuck with the ""no"" or just been gracious and swapped with the other guy.  (He was about 6'6"" and I'm a bit under 6'.)

19881,Not the A-hole," 

Growing up, I was fat. Not like, 200lb toddler, but I was fairly fat with a round belly, “developed” early because of it, getting my first period at 9 years old, breasts, hips. My Mom shamed me for it, despite being obese herself, and never even trying to teach me healthy habits. 

She would weigh me every single day and keep a chart on the fridge to let everyone know how fat I was. I lived with three brothers and my Dad. She forced me to go on her diets, but didn’t know enough about calories, exercise, etc to encourage me. I showed interest in things like dance and cheerleading, but she would tell me to lose 20lbs. When I did, she would say no, I was still too fat, and no one wanted a fat cheerleader.

There’s so much else, but it ended up with me falling down the eating disorder hole. I found companionship in online communities like Pro Ana, Blue Dragonfly, etc. I don’t want to go into detail about my disorder because it might hurt others. My first two therapists told me I didn’t have an eating disorder even though I threw up every day.

Now I’m 25, maintaining a relatively healthy weight. I shared a lot of this in a kind of written personal essay format. It includes my name, and links to my socials. It got a lot of positive feedback and earnest engagement with others who identified or wanted to share their own experiences.

It got back to my family, and they are all pissed. My mom is still obese (I know Reddit lives and dies by BMI, so she’s around a 34), and she flipped, created several accounts (IP traced) to say if I was fat as a 10 year old, isn’t that my own fault, it’s fucked up that children blame their parents, someone should tape my mouth shut. 

My support group posited that my Mom must have been trying her best, she had disordered eating too, maybe I was supposed to be fat, I’m villainizing my Mom when the real enemy is diet culture, why I felt the need to conform to beauty standards so hard when it was obvious I was meant to be fat. 

I’ve never had a relationship that progressed past chaste kisses and hand holding because I cry when I think about anyone seeing me naked, and Reddit posts about FUPAs and saggy skin and ruining my body really drove it home that I will never be the cute, skinny girl with taut unblemished skin, small lifted breasts, a tiny waist and collarbones someone would want to place gentle kisses.

Two years ago, a good friend of mine miscarried her daughter at around 18 weeks. It was a terrible time for her, and it broke her a bit. She chose to deal with it by starting an Instagram where she documents her loss, and for a while that helped. She started to referred to her as having been “born sleeping”, which is baffling to me (I believe that you shouldn’t sugar coat grief/death) but I figured that whatever gets her through the next year was fine, and I did my best to be supportive.

Since then, it’s become her identity. She always talks about it, her “journey”, and her “angel baby in heaven”. Hardly anything else! She even threw a birthday party twice for her daughter.  With a cake and candles!!! The first one I understood, but with the second one....felt ghoulish. I’ve experienced miscarriages (one at 14 weeks, another fairly early on) myself, and while it sucked, it was no great cataclysm, and I got over it rather quickly. I understand not everyone is like this, and that everyone heals on their own timeline, but I think that something is very wrong.

Her house has turned into a shrine for the daughter. Her hospital pictures are EVERYWHERE, and her nursery remains untouched. I would totally just let it go as harmless eccentricity except for the fact that she has a five year old son. He’s such a great kid, but it’s become clear that he is less of a priority to her than her grief. He appears on her social media, but never as like “just her son”, it’s always as “her brother” being graveside, holding the body in the hospital, posed next to a bigger picture of her face, etc. He’s become more of a prop than a person. 

Sometimes she’ll post pictures on her phone of the daughter  (she has SO many from that day, the funeral, etc), while the son tugs at her, begging her to play, and she will ignore him. It’s like she cares more about someone who never even lived than the boy she watched grow up. Her husband works a lot, and she is a SAHM, so while he does his best with the son, but you can tell that the son needs his mom.

Last week, she called me in tears because the son had destroyed some of the framed photos of his sister, and she had found him “destroying the nursery”. She said that she punished him, and told me she had no idea why he would disrespect his sister like that. I told her that “you would probably lose it too if you felt like you were competing with a ghost”, and that her obsession with her daughter is delusional, unhealthy and endangering her relationship with her VERY alive son. She lost it at me, saying I couldn’t possibly understand how she feels, etc. I told her that she needs to accept that her daughter died, and work through it. I urged her to get treatment, or to at least have her son see someone because her neglectful actions are setting him up for psychological damage.  She hung up on me, and though I’ve tried to call her back, she refuses to take my calls.

13215,Not the A-hole,"So, this happened this morning+ it’s my dads birthday

Apparently my cat was irritating my brother when he was making his present for my dad, and he picked her up to throw her out of his room. My cat must have landed weird or he must have thrown her too hard, because her upper leg bone was broken. My parents rushed my cat to the animal hospital while I tried to calm down my brother.


He was super upset he hurt the cat. So I made sure I told him that he didn’t mean to hurt her and he was a good boy. I believed it too. He really loves that cat, but he doesn’t know his own strength sometimes. He’s a wild kid and often will ignore pleas to stop doing something if it’s hurting them. He has hurt me and my mom multiple times (no broken limbs tho) due to his roughness. He’s 12 so he’s very energetic.


The cat came back with a cast, and is in a lot of pain right now and it’s horrible to see. In the meantime, we tried to celebrate my dad's birthday a bit, and had cake and opened presents. It must have taken my brothers mind off this morning because he was playing with our dogs. But he got rough again, and jumped from the stairs and landed just a bit from one of the dogs to scare her. He didn’t actually land on her but it was close. 

This made me MAD! I waited waited until everything was done with my dad to talk to my brother in his room. I said that he needs to control himself and his behavior or else he will hurt another animal. I told him that when someone tells him to stop, he needs to STOP. I didn’t curse or yell or anything but my tone wasn’t nice. I admit that.

He obviously was upset again, and when on about how he’s “a terrible kid” and completely glossed over what I was trying to tell him. He does this occasionally when someone is mad at him to make them pity him instead. He will go over the top with self-hatred in the moment and do nothing about his actual behavior. I told him to stop throwing a pity party and actually promise to change his behavior. He yelled at me saying I’m making him feel bad, and that he will be better (said very angrily). 

For the rest of the day I’ve been giving him the cold shoulder. I’ve helped my mom give medicine to the cat and try to comfort her. While my brother is watching movies downstairs. He cried again a few hours ago because the cat was howling in pain (medicine was wearing off), but then proceeds to go in his room and play on his DS for hours. 

When he talks to me, I am admittedly short with him.

Apparently, he told my mom that he thinks I’m mad at him and she came to my room crying that I need to not treat him so badly. She says he feels terrible enough and I need to support him. But I don’t think I should pretend like there isn’t a problem and that he isn’t at fault here. I wouldn’t have been mad if it weren’t for the incident with our dog literally hours after our cat came home.

11400,Not the A-hole,"This post requires a fair amount of context. 

I had a friend who I'll refer to as F. F has a super difficult home life. Her parents are abusive, she has untreated depression and anxiety, she lives in a house with a lot of drugs and alcohol and it's overall just an awful living situation. My living situation is close to perfect. I live alone with my Dad (who makes a really good income- enough to support a family of 4-5 easily, so we don't struggle) who I get alone with extremely well. My Dad has never smoked, doesn't drink and certainly never does drugs. I don't have any mental health issues and I truly love my life.

Recently F has been distant. A couple of days ago she was EXTREMELY rude. She followed me around for the day constantly butting into conversations that she wasn't even involved in by saying ""I don't care"". I didn't snap at her, or really do anything because I know some people have worse days then others.

I was however talking to F about how I might have to put down one of my pets soon (a rat, but this rat literally means the world to me.) and she once again butts in with ""I don't care"".

I still didn't comment on it, because I'm more mature then that and I refuse to lose my cool over 3 words repeated over and over again. However, about 5 minutes later we were all cracking jokes/sharing funny stories and I mentioned how the day before I ""lost"" one of my rats (they all come when they're called, and if they don't, my dog loves them and she'll find them in an instant - my dog would never hurt them, she just likes to watch them). Pretty much she jumped off my table because I left them and she went after me. Before I could finish the story (she had jumped high onto my tv unit and was licking the TV) F suddenly blurts out ""Good, I hope she died"" and continued on cracking jokes like before.

I looked at her in obvious disgust, stood up and said that I wouldn't be talking to her again and that was extremely inappropriate for her to say something like that to me, especially so soon after I was talking about my pet needing to be put down. I told her that just because she has a bad day doesn't give her ANY right to behave this way to another human let alone a friend. She responded with ""I don't care"". I walked away and I haven't talked to her since.

She found me later that day and tried to apologise but I shot that down straight away by simply telling her I meant what I said earlier and I walked away yet again.

I know she was being completely childish but I also NEVER snap at people. I don't raise my voice and I do feel I might be overreacting. My friends have told me I'm being dramatic and I'm not thinking about F's life and how she might be stressed but it still left a bad taste in my mouth.",52,76,0.89,AITA for being THIS mad over a joke?,bw76r1,2019-06-03 05:43:32,NTA,2747,AITA
18612,Not the A-hole,"Yesterday's Centrifuge post reminded me of one of moments I think of when I can't sleep at night. This happened about a year ago. It's much the same as the centrifuge story but a harder decision. 

Last year, as a high school senior, my school gave the opportunity to do student teaching of welding to the freshman shop students. Basically what I would do was teach the class one of the three days a week that we met. On that day, I would run through the curriculum, and give them a task for the day. Very rarely I would give basic demonstration like how to use a new kind of welding. I had been doing this for a year and a half already by the time the incident in question happened.

When I came into the lab one morning, I told a student (let's call him Caden) to start a oxy-acetylene flame. For the layman, this is a torch that shoots out invisible acetylene gas and you strike a spark in front of the torch to start a controlled flame. 

Caden lights the flame. As I help another student a few minutes later, I hear a loud clang and scream behind me. Caden has a red welding helmet over his head and two lit torches, flames pointing away from each other. He hops on the back of the rolling cart we use for the torches and gas tanks and wheels around the large lab torches lit, screaming ""Darth maul"". This seemed like amazingly juvenile behavior for a high schooler. 

I take safety *REALLY* seriously. In a fit of rage, I email the principal and request Caden's suspension and that he be banned from the class. 

Both requests were granted after other students reported it. Unfortunately, Caden was not allowed to drop the class and got an F. He failed 5 of 7 classes for the year, also, as he got an out of school suspension in the three weeks before finals.

22247,Not the A-hole," Throwaway account

A few months ago I (27F) invited my friend (41M) to move into my one-bedroom apartment. He needed a place to stay, and I wanted to pay off some debt.

I split the apartment into my room (living room), his room (bedroom), and kitchen/bathroom. This works for me because I like to keep to myself and need a bunch of time to recharge. I'm a homebody-even before COVID. He is not.

I have a history of depressive bouts and have been seeing a therapist for 3 years. I usually recognize the symptoms--overwhelming sadness, numbness, hopelessness, spurts of hurt and anger--and I disconnect from people around me. I usually try to explain, but its incredibly difficult when I don't even understand why I feel the way I do. Its become worse during quarantine, but I am actively seeking help.

Tonight I started feeling very down while working in my room. He's cooking in the kitchen and starts talking to me about Hamilton. I'm feeling really sad trying to reply but I give up and decide to be honest. I say ""Hey, you haven't done anything wrong, but I can't talk right now. I feel awful, emotionally.""He says ""Okay, is there anything I can do."" I say ""no, but thank you,"" and go on with what I was doing- not thinking anything of it.

10 minutes later he says ""I'm really irritated with you right now. I know this drill. You're gonna hole up for the next 4/5 days and I'm just gonna have to deal with it. It brings everything down. Maybe you can't feel that but it does."" I say ""what do you want me to do? I stay in my room. I don't know what else to do.""

He tells me that he's been gone all day doing stuff, and I just need to get outside, get some air; he wants to help. I said ""I'm doing the best I can,"" and he replied ""This is your best? I don't think this is the best you can do."" This really affects him. He says he has to prepare to come home and have to do a ""study hall"" (be alone in his room) because the energy is so negative.

I say that I feel judged and I know he wants a roommate to be his best friend and I think we have different values around that as I'm okay with sharing space without emotional closeness. He calls me condescending and I snap. I mockingly point out how he told me to cure my depression by ""going outside,"" and that if the energy is bad then lets whip out the fucking sage stick.

I don't see anything wrong with staying in my room when I'm not in good mental health space. I told him I needed space and it wasn't personal and I didn't have the room to be diplomatic. If he wanted to fight about it I was in a petty mood and would. He told me I was being nasty and he wasn't going to talk and walked out.

AITA in this? I know I could have been nicer in my responses, but I feel like this was completely avoidable and I tried to communicate clearly and effectively at the top.

EDIT FAQ INFO:
- He has the bedroom because he doesn’t have furniture. I gave him my bed/tables/dresser and put an air mattress in the living room for me where my desk/couch/TV is.
-The apartment is not open concept. Each room has a standard doorway. The living room has two on opposite ends.
-I do get outside everyday even when sad—I have a dog to walk. When not sad I run and go to the park.
- the “help” I’m seeking—biweekly therapy and have made an appointment for medication. My therapist is amazing and has truly changed my life.

21925,Not the A-hole,"I know how that title sounds, but hear me out. 

I'm the third of four siblings and I had a pretty shitty relationship with my parents. Dad openly disliked me from day one because he believed that I was the result of an affair Mum had (she admits to the affair happening but denies the other guy is my father). Mum resented me because she blamed me for the problems that belief caused between her and Dad. Neither of them were particularly subtle about their disdain towards me and I very much felt excluded/like the black sheep of the family my entire childhood.

Things took a real nosedive when I was a teenager. Dad developed a drinking problem and he was a very verbally nasty drunk. I usually took the brunt of the emotional abuse he'd hurl out. On occasion he'd go for one of the other siblings and they could turn to Mum for comfort and they'd get it. When I went to her after he'd been shitty to me, she'd ask what I'd done to upset him, explain why I deserved it or just straight up ignore me. Dad officially disowned me as his son when I came out as gay at 16, and mum stood by him. I moved out on my 18th birthday and went as low contact as possible. Despite him being the one to disown me first, Dad didn't take kindly to being cut off and did his damndest to cause trouble for me afterwards. This includes, but is not limited to, him ruining one of my first real relationships by feeding my ex boyfriend malicious lies, causing so much drama at my former workplace that I got fired and showing up to my wedding reception 4 years ago, despite not being invited, causing a scene and ruining the day. Mum, again, stood by him and took his side through all of this. 

Dad died of pancreatic cancer two and a half years ago, and Mum died of diabetes-related complications earlier this year. I didn't shed any tears or go to either funeral because both of them made my life hell. Next week would've been their ruby wedding anniversary. My siblings are arranging a celebration in their honour and asked me to come. I said absolutely not.

1202,Not the A-hole,"Ok a little background. I am a nanny, and my charge is three. We were at the zoo all day, so it was a long day and he was tired when we got on the train. It was a bit crowded but there was one seat and he quickly took it. A little bit later an older gentleman with a cane got on and asked (let’s call him Zach) to move. I quickly called out the older gentleman as there were PLENTY of able bodied adults he could have asked to move, but instead he chose to ask three year old Zach. 
The gentleman got snippy with me and explained that I am responsible to teach him manners and that he should always move when an older person gets on the train. I don’t really have a problem with this premise. I HAVE in the past made him move for older people on the bus when there were literally no other seats available and he was the only young one. 
However in this situation there were clearly plenty of other seats this gentleman could have asked for. I explained that Zach is three years old, tired from a day at the zoo and not likely to remember this event for any length of time. That there were plenty of able bodied people he could have asked and it’s not HIS job to teach my charge life lessons!
He was very rude and adamant and I’m sure it would have turned into more drama had a nice young woman not gotten up and let the gentleman sit.

4325,Not the A-hole,"I and my wife have very demanding careers. It pays well and is satsifying but we get called in last minute for emergencies. We have one daughter. We hired a full time nanny from a reputable agency so that there wouldn't  be last minute child care issues. 


We had issues with her from the time we started. Even though timings and time off was discussed in detail with the nanny and the agency before hiring her, after she was hired she ask for more time off, with no reduced pay of course. She wasn't really that great at being a nanny either. She screwed up a few things (food, bathing, etc) and overall didn't really seem like she had any actual professional nanny experience. We never said anything to her or the agency because we accepted there would be an adjustment period. 


She suddenly told us at 6 am in the morning one day that a relative had died and asked for emergency  leave. I had to take emergency leave as my wife couldn't. That day our cleaning agency came in and seeing that I was there and the nanny wasn't one of them asks, ""So she took that other job huh?"" That's how I found out that she had been offered a  job closer to her apartment with less pay but less hours. I tried to call her but she wasn't picking up her phone. She never turned up and I had to extend my emergency leave until we could get another nanny and my daughter adjusted to her. I was really worried that I'd lose my job over this.

5129,Not the A-hole,"Okay this is so stupid and I really feel like I'm NTA but my friend is adamant that I am so I'm seeking Reddit's opinion via a throwaway account. 

My girl friends and I were recently at Canada's Wonderland and having been there dozens of times since I was a kid (am now in my 20s), I know that the women's bathroom at the front of the park has ""additional stalls"" at the back of the bathroom. 

So basically there's about 10-15 stalls at first sight and then at the far back, there's a sign that says ""additional stalls ->"" and there's 4 stalls that are never, ever being used because they're off in their own corner room. 

Well, for the last few times I've been to the park, there's always a long line (like 15 women sometimes) and I always go straight to the back room to check if anybody is there. There never is and I use the bathroom stalls there. On my way out I'll always tell other women""hey there's stalls back there"" to which they say thank you.

My friend now thinks I'm selfish and rude for doing this. She thinks that I should always go to the front of the line, tell the women about the bathrooms in the back, and then join the line at the end. 

I don't see it this way because the sign is so clear and it's not my fault they're not seeing these additional stalls. Not only that but walking to the front of the line, saying that, and then going to the back of the line is awkward as hell. 

My friend hasn't let it go and is now saying she ""sees a different side"" of me. This is something I truly don't think is that big of a deal and my friend is making me feel terrible, I'm starting to question if she's right?

Please tell me if I'm wrong, seriously, I don't get it. 

TL;DR: Apparently I'm an asshole for utilizing bathroom stalls that nobody ever uses because they don't know they're there.

EDIT: This is epic.. I really never thought or could have imagined a post like this could get so much attention. Thank you to everyone that replied. I'm now taking a break from my friend and reassessing how she treats me and makes me question little actions that aren't worthy of explosive attitude from her.

16046,No A-holes here,"I got the idea a few weeks ago to prank my friends my pretending to be an ""Appletarian"", meaning somebody who only eats food products that are derived from apples and would only drink apple juice or apple cider. 

I told them them all that I had read on the internet that eating only apples was the healthiest thing for you. When I first told them they thought I was joking, but they underestimated how committed I would be to a joke. So, whenever in the presence of one of my friends (or friend-of-friends/coworkers/etc who knew them) I was very careful to only be seen eating apples or drinking apple juice/cider. 

Apples whole, apples diced, apple sauce, the inside of an apple pie, baked apples, candy apples with the chocolate shaved off, etc. 

Finally after about a week they bought that I had become an Appletarian. They started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. Some of them even got angry.

But I wanted to stick with the joke. Finally, after the end of 3 weeks, I walked into what I was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. 

They were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. Finally I started laughing hysterically. They were confused as hell so I told them I had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. I even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. 

I thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. My girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago I had ruined our date night when I told the waiter I only wanted apples because I was an Appletarian and had ""embarrassed her for a dumb joke"". 

In my opinion the joke was solid and they should appreciate my commitment to the prank. 

But, did I go too far?

547,Not the A-hole,"I will include a link to texts between us about this below.

Basically, my roommate is a nightmare. She has been letting her dog, who is potty trained, pee in our kitchen and then leaving it. She doesn’t take her out often enough or buy puppy pads. She usually gets to it within 24-36 hours of the mess being made but when it’s longer I have had to ask her to clean it several times. I have communicated to her several times that dog piss being left about is a serious issue for me. She thinks I hate it because I have OCD but honestly I don’t think anyone would just be cool with dog piss.

If she asks me to walk her dog and I have time I’m always glad to. In the past I’ve fed her and trained her a bit as well. She’s a good dog and I love dogs, I just am not ok with being her free dog walker more than 2-3 times a week because I have 2 jobs, I’m a student as well, and I specifically don’t have a dog because I know I don’t have the time to take care of one properly. I also buy all the cleaning supplies in the apartment and recently she asked me to buy her some bleach based cleaners because mine “aren’t good enough”. I did and had them in my room to give to her but hadn’t yet.

We got in an argument where I asked her to take care of the pee that was dried in the pantry and had been there for several days the day I was asking her. She has no job and no school to go to so it’s not unreasonable to ask her to do it within 24 hours. It turned into a huge argument and at the end I said I’d call the landlord and she still refused to clean it that day. 

I immediately called the landlord because she had basically refused to even agree to try and clean it that day, and she had said several things that bothered the hell out of me. I put the cleaning supplies in the living room and left for therapy and then work.

When I called the landlord the landlords office told me that they would give her a stern phone call and it would be taken care of. At no point did it enter my mind they could ban her because in my experience renting even with someone who has a nightmare pet the landlord can’t just ban it in CT.

So I get to work and we have the text conversation below. In summary, I tell her that I did not intend for her dog to be banned, and gave her some avenues to get it back, and she insists it was unreasonable for me to call the landlord in general over this and I’m a “psycho”, and she’s not going to bother trying to get her dog back.

AITA here? I get that it sucks hard her dog is banned, but I feel like she didn’t give me any other choice than to call the landlord.

Edit: she’s home and she brought the dog. I’m avoiding her and I have no idea what’s going on.

10501,Not the A-hole,"I’m using an alt for obvious reasons. 

For backstory, I’m female and live in the U.S. I’m on dating apps and I’m finding that a lot of guys are just disrespectful. Some of them are polite and want to start an actual conversation, but a lot, maybe even the majority, are just ridiculous.

A lot of the messages I get are “wanna fuck?” or “what are you looking for?” which is their way of indirectly saying “I want sex with minimal effort”. I even have in my profile that I don’t do random hookups, but I think I overestimated how often people actually read the profiles.

After having this happen a dozen times, I finally snap. A guy on Tinder messages me and the conversation seems to be going okay at first. We message back and forth and then I don’t hear a response. That’s okay, people get busy. 

At around 11:30 pm he hits me with the “Sorry, I got busy. What are you up to? Wanna have some fun?” During our initial conversation I make it crystal clear, I’m not looking for hookups. I don’t to casual sex. So I remind him of this, and he starts negging me. “I knew you’d be a prude”, “not sure why you wasted my time”, “let’s just meet up at my house and talk and see where things go.” 

Finally I was like, “okay, but come to my house.” and then I proceed to give him the address of a McDonald’s. In the next town over. I waited for him to get close to the location, he confirmed that he was about 5 mins away, and I unmatched him.

I just reached my breaking point with shitty men who feel entitled to ENTER MY BODY. I know the right thing to do would be to not engage, but also part of me feels like he deserved it.

14474,Asshole,"Good afternoon reddit. I figure this is the best sub for the latest drama between my sister, roommate and myself (technically, they are both my roommates). 

I guess to dispel stereotypes I should say upfront, I'm 24, female and a college grad looking for a more permanent job. I work at a national chain restaurant and actually love my job. I have a group of regular customers that I really, really love, my bosses are amazing and it's a great company. So anyways, for the past month our manager had a contest that the person who could get the most comment cards or online surveys filled out would get a $500 bonus. Since my regulars are so awesome, I easily won and he gave me cash at the lunch shift Thursday. So I've basically had $500 burning a hole in my pocket ever since. 

So today one of my regulars had just come in from the shooting range. I told him that I'd never even held a gun before but I always though they were super cool. He asked me if I'd like to come shooting with him some day. I said yes. He then asked if I could come to the parking lot with him and I could see and hold his guns. I took a break and it was like...holy crap he literally had a car full of guns. I really liked the AK-47 he had, just something about it totally drew my eye. So I complimented on it. He asked if I wanted it. I told him to stop joking with me. He said he wasn't joking at all and that he would give it to me for always being so nice to him. I told him about my bonus money and he said well to be fair he'd sell it to me for $200. I was like cool. So I went from never even holding a gun in my entire life to now i'm the proud freaking owner of an AK-47! My friend is going to take me shooting with it on Wednesday afternoon and I'm so excited. 

So I just got off shit and my sister and roommate are furious with me. They say it should have been implied that we never bring guns into the house. I told them we never talked about it. They both said exactly and basically ""banned"" me from bringing my gun into the house. Which to me is utter bullshit because I pay rent as well and I have the right to have whatever I want as long as it's legal in my space.

7513,Everyone Sucks,"I am taking a few courses at my college this summer, to help lighten the load come fall. This one professor had a decent review on [RateMyProfessor.com](https://RateMyProfessor.com), but one thing a lot of students definitely said was that he’s a hard ass about his cellphone/distractions policy. Now, I don’t care about that. Summer sessions are shorter, so you need to focus more and sped a lot more time in class, learning the material.

The thing is, this professor, if he seems someone on their cellphone or suspects they’re using their laptop for anything other than notes, will stop the lecture to go over and yell at them. This happens multiple times, throughout the class. It gets annoying, disrupts class and basically ruins whatever we’re doing. I get it’s disrespectful and that it’s on these students too, but if he just ignored it (especially as they’re doing it silently-no music or anything, I don’t even know they’re doing it until the professor is yelling-and it’s not bothering us), we could move along.

Today, he did it quite a few times within the first half hour of class. I got so frustrated with him, because we barely got through the first bit of the lecture and I felt like I was back in high school, not a university classroom. I let out an audible grumble and the professor gave me a look. I asked “Can we just go on with class?” He said, “When this student puts their phone away.” I said “You stopping class every time someone takes their phone out, takes away from us learning. It’s more annoying than a cellphone, to be honest.” He started on the syllabus and I just said I didn’t want to argue, I just wanted to learn.

After class, we all got an e-mail about the policies again and if we “had any issues with how he ran his classroom, to please see him after class”.

I don’t know if I made things better or worse. The class is over next week, thank God, I just had to say something because I feel like I learned so little in this class. (Btw, I have never been yelled at by him before this entire session, so I’m not being bitter about it or anything. I’m just being annoyed about having to stop class.)

I had arranged a day in which I would break things off in person because that would’ve been the right thing to do, right??

Fast forward about a week before doing the deed, keep in mind I chose a day that was after exams as I didn’t want to bring extra stress into her life. 

She texts me asking if everything is ok (I assume I was subconsciously stand-offish as per me no longer sharing feelings. She was suspicious of this). 

That day was also the morning of one of her exams. I was torn because I didn’t want to have to end it with her during exams (let alone on the day of an exam) and I didn’t want to lie and say it was all ok only to break it off with her a week later. 

I decided to respond and say “can we meet up and talk about that?” to which she said something like “I can’t handle face to face. If you’re breaking up with me i’m gonna break up with you first.” and then tried to guilt me about it being on the day of one of her exams. 

Keep in mind I still tried to make her less upset by asking if she had any questions or anything that would help her clear her mind.

19615,Not the A-hole,"My fiancé  loves The Sopranos. As in, he has watched the entire show ten+ times and considers it ""an important part of his life."" I'm haven't watched it, but was willing to give it a shot since we're running out of shows that we enjoy watching together, and he wants me to ""experience"" this particular show with him.

We're on Season 2. Here are my gripes with The Sopranos (I'm probably going to get a lot of hate for this but, fuck it): 1) I think that characters get introduced too frequently, and let's be honest - no one really remembers names of people that aren't really main characters & 2) The episodes are a continuous 50 mins and pack a lot of details in.

Anyway, as we watch, he insists that I don't pick up my phone even to answer a text really quickly (keep in mind it's not something substantial like checking email or social media)...but when I do, he insists that I'm not paying attention or I'm buried in my phone. He also picks up his phone throughout. Also, as we watch, he provides commentary like explaining how the mafia works or the difference between ""this is our friend"" vs. ""this is my friend"" or even extraneous trivia about an actor himself (""this guy is actually in jail for being in the actual mafia""), which I'm okay with because it means a lot to him to explain this stuff to me. He also continuously asks questions (as if he's trying to quiz me or catch me not paying attention) like ""who's that guy?"" or ""why did he do that?"" Usually, I get his questions right and we move on.

Last night, as I quickly responded to a text, there was a scene where someone (again, bad with names) meets a Federal Agent. I heard the whole conversation where he talks about being out of Quantico for five years etc. and being an agent, which to me sounded like he was out of jail (well, I now know what it is, but that's beside the point) and all the mafia terminology doesn't help. Fiancé , seeing that I've picked up my phone, asks ""who's that guy"" and I said what I thought, which apparently set him off because I ""wasn't paying attention"". 

Sorry but, how am I supposed to pick up on every detail sitting next to someone who's watched it over ten times? How does anyone with no knowledge of the subject watch a show for the first time? I reiterated these points to him and told him that if he's constantly going to interrupt and expect me to watch an episode once and expect me to catch every detail and get upset when I don't, I'm not going to keep watching it despite how much it means to him.

At my job I don’t mind referring friends who would work hard because it helps me out as I get a bonus and I get to have friends work with me. The would be employee first fills out an application and when I give management their name and number they are guaranteed an interview and almost always the job. In my position we are required to operate heavy machinery and prior to our first day we have to take a drug test. A friend of mine asked me to refer her and although I knew she smoked weed heavily I knew she would keep it professional at work. I told her I gladly would and told her I would wait a bit before giving her info to management so she would be able to pass the drug test. Two days ago I gave her information to HR as I thought enough time had passed for clean results. Management thanks me and tells me they will call her this week for an interview. The same night she  sends me a video on Snapchat of her smoking weed. At this point I decide she really isn’t serious about this and go in the following day to tell them she wouldn’t be a good fit  AITA for not telling her this?

This didn't happen recently, but roughly two years ago. My cousin said she was pregnant and having a baby boy, and said she was going to name him Casey. Well, my name is Casey. Naturally I got a little upset about this, and she said that it didn't matter, and that she had planned to name her baby Casey for years before I was even born. My whole family was kinda upset about it, with me obviously being the most upset, and only she and her mother would not budge. Even her husband felt wrong doing it, saying ""There's really only one Casey and it seems wrong to do this.""

Well the time comes and she names the baby Casey. My family collectively does an eye roll but who are we to say she can't do it, it's her baby. So we all call him nicknames instead of calling him his real name so it doesn't get confusing when I'm around too.

His eating habits also disgusted me.  I was friendly, so I guess he thought I liked him, but I just didn’t want to hurt his feelings and embarrass him in public by leaving the date early .  We had talked about a certain book before the date and he brought his copy to loan to me.  I turned him down, knowing I didn’t want to see him again, but he kept insisting - was quite pushy about it actually - so I took the book.  

Later, I sent him a gentle ‘I’m not interested’ text and he flipped out, calling me superficial, entitle bitch, etc.  He also demanded I meet up with him to give him his book back. This did not sound pleasant.  I did want him to get his book back, but did NOT want to be around him again, especially now that this giant man was angry with me.  I was running errands and he kept texting me.  The book was in my car, and we were in the same general area, which happened to be near a Whole Foods.  I decided to turn his book in to WF customer service.  I told the lady I found it in the store, and she took it without question.  I left and sent a text to they guy telling him where he could pick up his book.  At this, he really flipped his shit, and according to him, I am the worlds biggest asshole.

Edited to add - one commenter said my asshole status regarding the mayonnaise insult depends on its relevance to the date.

Dad seems to see her as my step mother, where as i see her as dad’s partner. 

She had a daughter from a previous marriage who is mid twenties, never held down a full time job, never made an effort to be social at family functions (if she even attends them), still has the mother pay half her rent, and whilst not nice to say, comes off as a bit of a loser. 

The daughter has recently gotten engaged to a fella. After they announced the engagement, she told her mother that the fella was a fully patched member of an outlaw motorcycle club. 

Dads side of the family think this is hilarious, and it kind of is. 

The rub now comes that dad is insisting that I invite them to my wedding, and I’m being “precious” for not wanting to associate with a bikie. 

(I should add that my employer (state based law enforcement) would not look favorably on such associations and a group of work colleagues will be at the wedding.

12246,Asshole,"I thought I was a complete asshole in this situation, but I saw a similar post a couple of days ago, which included a similar situation, but the focus was on a different point, but the comments briefly mentioned the situation I am in, so I am now confused and don't know what to do.

Essentially, me and my bf said that we were going to go to an escape room when they first started to become popular. Life got ahead of us, and being long distance meant that we never got a chance to. He and his family ended up going to one for one of their birthdays, and whilst I was slightly upset about not being able to experience it together for the first time for us both, it was no big deal, as it wasn't the one that we had shown an interest in together. A year or so has passed, and we still haven't got round to going together. He then mentioned to me that his friend is planning on going to the exact one we planned to go to for his birthday, and my boyfriend said he didn't really want to go, but probably will. I had a bit of a moan at him about me always missing out on things, to which he called me unreasonable, so I dropped it. I don't very often complain at him for doing things without me, but he does quite often go places we planned to try out together, and then brushes it off when I am upset about it. I don't care that he does things which we have already done, or that he sees his friends or whatever, just that he can't seem to wait for me to try new things. I know the escape room situation is different, as he didn't get to choose what it is, but not only can he not really afford it, but he doesn't really even want to go with his friends.

I helped him with his costume that afternoon then I went to his house and the party went great. I was getting to know his friends while he mingled so we weren't together all the time. Towards the end people were pretty drunk and eager to leave for the club so they started calling ubers to head there. Throughout all this I kept going back to him like ""X person said they'd be getting their uber now so just so you know""

People started slowly leaving and this is when he starts cleaning up, said he had to leave the house clean before we left. I offered to help clean up and he said no, to just have fun. So I did and honestly it wasn't a big mess either just clearing some cups and some bottles and cans.

I did notice he seemed really annoyed and was being very quiet so I kept aksing if he felt ok and he said yes and that he still wanted to leave for the club (he's been having stomach issues).

So at the end there's just 4 of us and the uber is about to get here so I go up to him and I tell him ""the uber is about to get here do you want to leave now or you and I can stay, finish cleaning up and get our own uber?"" to which he replies annoyed ""I really don't feel good so you just go, I'm not going"" I felt he was just very annoyed at people including me so I decided to give him space and I said ""okay, I hope you feel better"" and I got in the uber and left.

It was from a company that he’s a customer of, but he hadn’t bought anything through them recently.  He called the company, and they were able to confirm that someone had created an account at their site and used his credit card number to make the purchase.  They closed the other account and said they would refund his money. They also advised that he reach out to his credit card company about the fraud. Easy enough, right?  Nope.  He then demanded that they give him the name/contact info of the other account.  The customer service rep he was speaking to refused to give him that info and said that company policy didn’t allow her to share that.

725,Not the A-hole,"I normally wouldn't have too much trouble deciding things like this, but since family is involved my judgement is somewhat clouded.

I have one brother and two sisters, and as it stands and has stood for years the plan for my parents' retirement is purely for us young adult offspring to pay for their old age.  

I'm going into a programmer field, and as such will be paid pretty well, but I'll be making the most out of my siblings.  (Army, vet tech, special Ed (mostly autism) one on one)

My parents' side is that they paid for our childhood, and that while my father now makes six figures he only started making that much about 9 years ago.  We've had to do a lot of work on the house, which has been expensive (biggest by far was redoing the roof, which cost about 40k US dollars).  Because of these things, they believe it should fall on us to pay for their old age in it's entirety.  

My side is that they paid for our childhood, but haven't paid for anything else.  Come college time they decided to pay for exactly $0 of it.  They said 4 kids was too many to pay for college for, but that doesn't mean you should pay for nothing at all.  We missed out on getting financial aid because of how much my father made, but ended up getting zero help from him regardless.  My mother also works as a teacher, which means they are making even more than just what my father makes.  
Also, it's true he's only had the job 9 years, but that's still a long time.  He's in no danger of losing his job and he's been getting consistent raises.  
They chose to have children.  We didn't choose to have parents

I wouldn't be upset about helping out some, but they've been putting zero effort into a retirement plan.  No effort at all.  Our futures are on us to pay for, but apparently so are theirs


EDIT: Several people have been asking about location and cultural effects.  I live in America, specifically Maryland.  I am not aware of any cultural effects that affect their decision making process

Edit 2:  Not as important, but I would like to mention that in every way other than this they've been great parents.  They've done their best to raise us, and ended up doing pretty good.  It doesn't change the decision they made to put this on us, but I wanted things to be considered in the light that they are otherwise good people and we are on good terms

Edit 3:  Thanks everyone for the advice.

She said that I am still on her insurance and she will not send me to a hearing doctor because it would be ""useless"", as it is just 'selective hearing', and she wont foot that bill.

My younger sister and I are both in our 20s and I have been extremely fortunate to have been able to retain my cushy software engineering job throughout the pandemic. On the other hand, my sister had her hours cut severely at her first job and had to take on a 2nd job in which she has to go to work and be around people every day even though she has asthma. I am a strong proponent for living wages/universal basic income, and I consider my current position to be due to mostly good luck and being born with high school/learning stats.

My sister has been so strong through everything and hasn't accepted any help from my parents or me. Now she's moving in with a boyfriend for the first time (yay!).

Mom was understandably devastated when he passed. He'd been having some major health problems for years so my siblings and I all knew it was coming.

My wife and I dropped everything and drove halfway across the country for a month to see her and help out. 

While we were there my wife and I went by the house to see what she would need to get rid of. She had done an estate sale which had gotten rid of almost all of the furniture but the 3 car garage was pretty much entirely full of boxes. It took us over a week in 100 degree heat but we went through every single box in that garage to find and save any important stuff.

One of the things we did find was a journal my Dad had written in. He had purchased it when I was 14 and wrote in it very occasionally over the span of about 3 years. There are 14 entries in the journal over that span. It's written in such a way that he never expected anybody else to ever read it. 

It's really, really negative. He obviously treated this as some sort of catharsis at a low point in his life. He writes about how awful his life is. How his wife is stupid and useless and spends way too much money. How his kids have no respect for him. How he can't do anything because they take all his money. While I always was positive on my father I actually gained a ridiculous amount of respect for him reading that journal.

I think this journal would destroy my mom. My wife and I spoke about it after we both read it and decided not to tell her about the journal. We took it back home with us after we left. My mom was able to short-sell the house and buy a small house next to my sister. As her health is getting worse she's now sold that house and moved in with my sister. She's spent a large chunk of the past year in the hospital or in rehab. She has a lot of physical health problems including a kidney cancer that is complicating things.

So, Reddit, I ask you this: Am I the asshole for never telling my mother about my father's secret journal? (full story in comments)

**EDIT: Thanks, everyone. We were pretty sure that it had been the right decision but it came up again between my wife and I in conversation last night when we were reading some awesome AITA posts together, so I decided to write it up. I have never journeled before and many in the comments helped me understand why he likely wrote in the journal. I assume it just got put on a bookshelf and he forgot about it for the next 16ish years until he died and it happened to get moved to a box during the estate sale.

19641,Not the A-hole,"My mother graciously paid for the shoot, with a photographer that I did a 21st birthday shoot with a year ago. I knew she was a bit outspoken, but today was horrible. 

It started off okay. It came up again that I'm afraid of bugs (mother told her last year, fiancé brought it up this time) and she ribbed me a bit about it. 
A little ways in, she wanted us to do a specific pose. We got a little confused by her explanation, and she got a little impatient, exclaiming that it was ""about time"" when we did it correctly. 

This was my fiancé's first time doing a photoshoot, so he was a bit nervous at times. I helped him here and there, but when she'd notice she'd tell us how we  looked like friends, not two people about to get married. I could tell he was starting to get uncomfortable.

We had to hike a bit to get to different locations. On the way to one, she pointed out a trail that looked really pretty, but informed us that we ""only see a bunch of trees"" while she sees ""so much more"" because she's a photographer which was a bit annoying. Of course we're sweaty and a little tired from all the walking and climbing around, and in between shots my fiancé physically looked tired. I guess she took this as a slight towards her because she yelled at him for looking ""pouty"" and ""annoyed"" at her, to which both me and my mother explained that he was just hot and thirsty. All along each location, some joke about me being afraid of bugs kept getting brought up. I never overreacted or even reacted much to the bugs around us, only swatting some away from our faces. 

I'm miffed at this point and just want the shoot over with. We're climbing down to a creek for a few shots when my fiancé asked me if I was okay since I had some trouble on the steepish hill. I mentioned my shoes were a bit too big for me and I was afraid of falling because of it. Photographer told me to take my shoes off, I declined, and of course it was because I ""was afraid of my feet touching bugs"" when no, I just didn't want my bare feet on broken up stone and suspicious sharp things in the dirt in a public park. Then she wanted us to climb over a few decently sized fallen trees to get to a smaller one so we could sit on it. I watched my fiancé hoist himself over and balance precariously to get over them. I put my foot up on the tree and realized that I couldn't do it because of the shoes. I was trying to find a different way to get there, but my mother and the photographer kept yelling at me to ""just do it"" and ""come on, really? You'll be fine"". 
I finally snapped and told them I was done. ""We're taking the picture where we are or I'm ending the shoot and going home"". She conceded to just taking the pictures at the part of the creek we were at, and then on the way back acted as if I was frail and needed extra assistance to get back up the slope. ""Let her go first since she might fall"".

In the moment, I felt justified. Now I'm second guessing myself after overhearing my mother and the photographer talking about how I acted. AITA?",17,94,0.97,AITA for snapping during our photoshoot?,h95tn1,2020-06-15 01:02:01,NTA,3034,AITA
20149,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I live in a secluded suburban neighborhood in NE Austin. Our house is situated on a cul-de-sac that is also near a community trail that extends behind our house. The trail is small and circles a natural detention pond, but many of the the neighborhood residents use. Our backyard can see everything and we have interacted with many people walking because we are so close.   

&#x200B;

So, last night at 9:15 pm my wife and I are playing a card game. We have been busy lately and ordered in food, watched the Killing Eve finale and wanted to play some games. As we are playing, our doorbell rings. We both look at each other confused, and our dogs go crazy barking at the front door. My wife and I have the same thought, it's probably one of our neighbors we are close to and needed something or whatever. I walk up to the front door and peep through the hole and am surprised to see a teenage kid my guess is he's about 16 years old. I hesitate to say anything or open the door. I look at him again and recognize that I have seen him on the trail walking all the time with his dog, usually on his phone. Having recognized him, I open the door. Here is our conversation:

&#x200B;

Me: Hey what's up?

&#x200B;

Him: My airpods are in your house.

&#x200B;

Me:..........um what's that?

&#x200B;

Him: My Apple airpods are in your house.

&#x200B;

Me: I don't understand what you mean, why would your airpods be in my house. You have never been in my house and we have never interacted before. 

&#x200B;

Him: Can I come in and look?

&#x200B;

Me: No, why do you think your airpods are in my house?

&#x200B;

Him: I lost them while walking the trail, and the ap says there are in your house. \[He shows me\]

&#x200B;

Me: \[Not understanding how the ap works because I don't have any of my own\] Look, I don't know why they are showing to be in my house, but they aren't. They are probably still on the trail somewhere. I am happy to let you look around my yard if you want, but you're not coming in my house.

&#x200B;

Him: \[Aggravated now\] Can I ping them and see if I hear them?

&#x200B;

Me: Sure, go for it. \[He does, shockingly no sound occurs\] There aren't here dude, they must still be on the trail. 

&#x200B;

Him: So I can't come in and look.

12211,No A-holes here,"Before I start, I just want to say that I was unsure where else to post this. I don't believe that I am an asshole for doing this, but a few people have called me some pretty nasty things, and I just want to know what you guys think. 

I'm also writing this from an alt account, because some friends know about this story and I don't want them to see my main account. 

So a few days ago I began playing fortnite again after a long hiatus, mostly because a friend wanted me to play, but I've been enjoying myself. Usually I play alone, but yesterday I decided to just join a game with some random people. Once we all loaded in, it was me, two (presumably) teenage guys, and a young child. When the child began to talk, the two guys immediately began to smack talk this child. I felt bad and told them to just mute the two other guys and talk to me, because I don't mind playing with kids, I want them to have a good time too!

The kid started complimenting my microphone, asking if I was a streamers or singer etc. , But was mainly drawn to my username because both of our names referenced sushi. I had a better time talking to this kid than I do most games, mostly because the toxicity was non-existent, and we were both just playing for fun anyways. During the game, the kid was talking about how she doesn't have any friends to play fortnite with, and when I asked if anyone from school plays, she told me that she doesn't talk to anyone at school because they make fun of her voice. This really broke my heart! I was unsure how old this kid was, or even if it was a guy or girl, but didn't really care honestly. After the game ended, they added me and I accepted, and wanted to play some more games with me. I ended up inviting my girlfriend to play with us, and that's when I found out the kid was a girl, mostly because she was super excited to get to talk to another girl that played fortnite! After playing a few games, we find out that this kid is only 7 years old, which did freak me out a little bit considering I'm a 21 y/o guy, but I still didn't let it bother me to the point of de-friending her, mostly because I felt bad that she had no one to play with.

I don't feel like I'd ever go out of my way to invite her to play again, though if she asked me to play I feel like I would feel awful saying no just because a few people called me some rude things. A few friends called me a creep/weirdo when I told them about this situation, but I truly have no bad intentions here. I wholeheartedly just want to give this kid a good gaming experience, especially with how a lot of female/children gamers are treated nowadays. 

I apologize for any mistakes in the writing, I'm on mobile right now, but I just want to know if I did the right thing, or if what I did is seriously weird or gross.

TL:DR - I played fortnite with a 7 y/o girl, and accepted her friend request to play again sometime. She seemed super happy to play with someone who wasn't an asshole to her for once.

EDIT: I wanted to add a little edit to thank everyone for your kind replies. It's probably pretty unlikely that I will end up playing with her again, mostly due to my newly packed work schedule and vacation coming up, but if she ever does ask me to play a few games, I'm going to make sure to attempt to speak to one of her parents, or at least make sure they know that she's playing with older people.",250,858,0.96,AITA for playing fortnite with a young girl?,brfg6x,2019-05-21 20:28:51,NAH,3390,AITA
10243,Asshole,"So my fiancé and I were working on the list of people that we are inviting to our wedding next year, and he wants to invite one of his ex-girlfriends, who he is still friends with. I am not down with that.

I said I don’t want to us to get married in front of the girl who was his gf before me and with whom he had his longest relationship (they were together for 6 years, we have been together for 1). I have met the girl a couple of times, we are civil and I know she is engaged so this is not about jealousy. The idea just feels really weird and uncomfortable to me.

He said that she is part of his friend group and he cannot invite all of their friends and leave her out. He said that she is a part of his life as his friend before and after she was his girlfriend (He lived with her in college and she paid for everything because he was broke from supporting his siblings). He said she does not need to be seated anywhere near the altar where I can see her but he wants her to be there.

3277,Asshole,"I (35M) have an 8yo son who loves videogames. Ever since he was 3yo we haven't been able to (or wanted to) pry his hands away from controllers. He's very good at them now. He is obviously VERY much into Minecraft and Fortnite, but he also plays other (mainly Nintendo) games. 

Thing is, if the game requires any tiny bit of thinking, puzzle solving or searching, he goes directly to YouTube. 

Now, it's obviously not a crime at all. I used guides too when I was his age and still do. But I used them *only* when I was stuck and had tried to figure it out for a while. He uses them for every-single-thing. 

Also, English is not our native language. I know many people (myself included) who were able to practice their English reading comprehension by being forced to play videogames in English.

I consider videogames an AWESOME tool to learn problem solving, decision making, critical thinking and many other great mental gymnastics. 

And here's where my problem with him resorting to YouTube 100% of the time lies. IMO he's not going to develop any of that because he's getting spoon fed the solutions all the time. He searches for Spanish-speaking YouTubers so he doesn't have to figure out what the game is asking him to do. And he's being shown how to solve every puzzle, where to find every item, how to kill every boss, etc.

The other problem is that he almost always comes in, very smug, showing off what item he got, what boss he defeated (yeah it takes hand-eye skills to do so, but part of the journey is figuring out *how* to kill them), etc. He even turns it into a competition like, checking to see if I already reached the point in the game he's on. If I have, he makes a frustrated gesture and if I haven't, he points it out constantly. He sometimes also points out things about the game that neither of us has found yet, ""I know how to get the super flashy sword from this boss, do you?"" 

Mostly at these times is where I have to minimize his smuggness by pointing out he only knows these things, defeated those bosses, or found those items because he saw it on YouTube instead of finding things on his own. He's obviously not practicing his reading comprehension or his English like many other people have before him. I insist on him using YouTube only as a final resource after trying to figure things out on his own and paying attention to what the characters say or the clues they give him.

I've even started to think and suggest that I should maybe take YouTube away from him since it's making him lazy. (There's a whole other cliché parenting thread I could start by talking about how kids are stuck to YouTube nowadays but it's all been said before).

I know I probably sound like a cranky old man yelling at a cloud, but AITA here?

Edit: I may not have been clear on the smugness paragraph. It appears some of you think I'm jealous of my kid for getting the flashy sword before me or something. What I mean by pointing that out is that I try to point out to him how it'll be more rewarding if he figures it out on his own instead of looking it up on YouTube. When he does figure stuff out on his own I praise him. When he shows me something in the game that I didn't know and he discovered himself, I praise and thank him.",58,130,0.89,AITA for pointing out to my son that he only finishes games because of YouTube?,dav7xt,2019-09-29 13:38:08,YTA,3254,AITA
20575,Not the A-hole,"We live in a tight knit community and We are friends with most of the neighbours and my husband gets on with everyone. 

He is the type of person who likes to help out and is a good handyman and mechanic. He rarely accepts payment and just takes pleasure out of a job well done.

As a result he has a reputation as a complete yes man.

My husband is close to one neighbour ""Fred"", they are inseparable and he is always helping him out and fixing cars together. We all get on well with Fred and will always help each other out where we can.
It's a total bromance.

So My husband had agreed to help a different neighbour, a single mum, to rebuild her fence.

Fred et al. were outside and drinking. The hot sun and beer didn't mix very well. 

All day they were catcalling my husband telling him he was going to get sex as payment etc. Which my husband ignored, but it persisted for the whole day.

However, it did upset my stepdaughter (14) who found it offensive as they kept on.

Later he and ""Sam"" were going to have a social distance beer.

The catcalling started again. Even though he was in Sam's front garden.

My husband ignored them which I think pissed them off. They were very drunk by this point.

My step daughter had had enough, she shouted at them to stop and that me and her dad were married and she didn't like it.
They started shouting at her... these are all grown men.

So my husband shouted that was enough and they had upset her.
Fred got all up in my husband's face and shouted at him about ""what did you say to me?"" And my husband totally calm said he had upset her.

Fred told us all to f off and was very rude.

My stepdaughter comes in crying and said she had caused a fight and it was her fault but she couldn't bear what they were saying about her dad because it wasn't true.

I'm pregnant and hormonal so I got cross. I consoled her but I could still hear them shouting shit outside so I went out there and confronted Fred.

I'm 5ft 8 and I got a bump.

Fred on the other hand is 6ft 5. So he towers over me.

I went over and said I understood it was a joke and they all thought it was funny but you made her really upset and cry.
I also said the joke had gone too far and that they needed to stop.

My husband has started coming over, by this point Fred is screaming in my face that he doesn't care that he made her cry and that I can f off and get out of his face. 

I said it was unacceptable and he had crossed the line making a child cry for no good reason.

He's in my face shouting at me and my husband pulled me away and told me to leave it.

It was all so unexpected and nasty.
But I told him I didn't want him to be friends with Fred anymore. I thought Fred had been totally out of order and his true colours had come out.

So here is where I might be TAH? Was it out of order for me to tell my husband not to be friends with Fred anymore and for getting involved and essentially getting into a fight with Fred myself?

EDIT: Fred has said he is done with the lot of us this morning.

Also Fred was best man at our wedding.

My 30 year old brother has never had a lot of luck dating. His most recent ex is a woman he met while on vacation in the Dominican Republic. I have never met her. They tried doing long distance, but it didn't work out. While they were in a relationship, he decided to give her the password to my Netflix account so they could watch shows together. He didn't consult me about it - I found out when Netflix notified me that my account was accessed in the Dominican Republic. 

According to my brother, the family doesn't have a lot of money. However, they've been broken up for over a year and she just had a baby with another man.

While I don't think she would be malicious enough to change the password one day and take ownership over it, there's always that chance she could.

16435,Everyone Sucks,"For about a year and a half, I had feelings for my friend from uni. We hung out a lot and did a lot of “couple things”, such as cuddle and hold hands and stuff, but never anything more. Anytime I would ask her out, she would decline and say she wasn’t looking for a relationship right now. Totally understandable.

A month and a half ago, I met another girl and immediately fell for her. We started a relationship. During this time, me and my friend stopped talking as much. We would still run into each other at school and say hey and occasionally text but nothing like before. 

About a week ago she waited for me at my car and confronted me, asking me why I was avoiding her and not treating her how I used to. I told her the truth, that I was in a relationship now. She said something like “I thought you liked me?” And I told her that I did, but she never seemed interested so I backed off and moved on. She seemed to accept it and that was that, but then she texted me later in the day that she liked me a lot and that she didn’t expect me to just give up on her, etc. She said I should at least give us a chance before being with someone else.

The other day, she texted me and invited me to go out with her and some friends, and when she told me who was going, it sounded like it was like a triple date kind of thing, with us being the third couple. Not wanting to be paired off with the girl who rejected me for a year and a half and only suddenly showed interest in me when I’m no longer available, I asked my girlfriend if she wanted to go out with me and some friends, she said sure, so I texted back my friend that I’d be there. 

Last night was the outing and I showed up with my girlfriend. My friend was left being the odd man out and spent the entire night being clearly upset. She spent the night being pissy while looking at her phone. She texted me in the middle of dinner “I didn’t think you’d bring her. I invited you, not her”, but I didn’t care. It was shitty of her to try to force us into a date-like situation when she knows I’m taken now. 

When we were in the car to leave, my girlfriend called the situation before I could even say anything, and said I was an asshole for dragging her into it. She said I should’ve just declined the invite and that she felt bad for my friend because I embarrassed her in front of her friends. I didn’t think she’d side with a girl who was actively trying to make me leave her but she did. 

I really liked my friend. For a year and a half and she never seemed interested in me the way I was in her, which is fine. But now that I have someone else, she suddenly has feelings and wants me. It’s super shitty on her part. But now she’s mad, and my girlfriend’s mad, and yeah, it would’ve been more mature just to not go, but I don’t think what I did was that bad.

20557,Not the A-hole,"I had a 90s convertible sports car that was my baby, it was a 2 seater, stick shift, drop top. It was absolutely gorgeous and I loved it so much. I bought it in high school and it taught me everything I know about car maintenance because I did everything on it myself.

It was recently totaled in an accident, I got rear ended by a guy not paying attention. It really sucked, and I decided I wanted to save up and buy another car. I wanted another 2 seater, convertible, stick shift, old enough to be easily maintainable because newer cars are more computerised.

I was about 2/3 of the way to my savings goal when my boyfriend gifted me this car, a 7 seater mini van. Gently used, his neighbors were selling it. I was at first blown away by his generosity, I signed the title without thinking too much about what it meant.

But later I started to feel weird about it when we talked about why he picked that car. Because it wasn't just that his neighbors happened to be selling it.

I asked why he picked something so big when he knows I am uncomfortable driving large cars and like small ones?

He said that he was thinking about our future family.

I felt kinda blindsided because while I might want kids someday, I don't think I'll feel that way soon. I'm 24 and just finishing graduate school and starting a career, it's not been on my mind.

He said that he thought I was more serious about wanting to make a life with him. He also wants kids with me, he's 35, has 2 kids from his previous marriage, and would want to start a family with me before the kids are too far apart in age.

I feel really weird about how things went. He and I have only been in a relationship for a year and a half, we've never had a serious conversation about kids, marriage, a blended family, any of that. We've never lived together, he hasn't even met my family.

It felt weird that he'd only talk about these things after he'd bought me a family car. It felt kind of manipulative, like he bought the car with certain expectations that I had no idea of.

I talked to my friends over this, and when I said that I felt like this had been kind of manipulative, the floodgates opened. My friends were all like ""honestly we think he's a manipulative ass and have thought that from the start, but we didn't know if we should say anything"" I said if course, I'd want to talk about it, and for the next few hours we talked stuff through. 

I guess my friends picked up on a lot of sketchy stuff that I hadn't known was abnormal; this was my first relationship and I didn't exactly have the best example of a good relationship from my parents...

Anyway, after that talk and a lot of thinking, I decided I couldn't stay with him.

I'm getting ready to break up, and I just don't know what to do about the car. Transfer ownership back to him? Keep it and sell it? I don't want to keep and drive it because it's gonna be a reminder of what was honestly a pretty bad time in my life.

17,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because family knows my main.

Okay, here goes. This pissed me off to no end but I think mostly because it was unexpected. I think if they'd just been honest there wouldn't have been a problem.

So I was planning on going home to see my family for a bit. My parents moved recently into a smaller place so no longer live in the family home, and there's nowhere for me to stay. My brother also recently moved and I had yet to see his new place, which he said was massive. He's got two kids so I assumed as much.

He offers to let me stay with him rather than getting a hotel. Obviously, money is money so I eagerly accepted his offer. He specifically said he had a spare bed. You can probably see where this is going bearing in mind the title of this post.

I get to his house, ask where I should dump my bag, and he shows me to the bed. The bed is actually an airbed, which is outside, in the back garden, inside a flimsy fucking tent. There is a single pillow and a sleeping bag.

I mean jesus. So I laughed, I thought it was a prank and felt completely played. Fair enough, I thought. Just another in a long and storied tale of brothers getting one over on each other. Not something we have done much in our family, but to be fair after the initial surprise I ended up thinking it was quite funny. I did try and sleep outside but found it kinda rough, so I ended up coming back inside in the middle of the night and sleeping on the sofa.

I should say that he left the backdoor unlocked for me so I could use the kitchen, the bathroom, etc.

Anyway. Next morning I wake up and he tells me I've got to go. As in, leave the house altogether. It's like 7am. Turns out his wife has completely freaked out because I'm sleeping on the sofa. It's a brand new sofa and people can't sleep on it?? As if that's a thing. I tell him to fuck off because I'm sleeping. He is not joking though and I realise this finally. And yes, I literally get my things together and go.

The next day my mother tells me my brother was seriously offended that I didn't sleep in the tent, talked about all the effort he'd put into it and how he'd been planning it for ages. Like, he wasn't joking before. He really seriously thought it was cool to offer a spare bed and show me to a tent.

I'm not the asshole for sleeping on the sofa, right? Do I owe my brother an apology? I feel like I'm probably going to apologise because his feelings have been hurt, just to make him feel better and save face. But surely I don't actually owe him one?

14521,Not the A-hole,"I know the title probably doesn't sound great - but hear me out.

For some reference, I live with my brother, and also my girlfriends (polyamorous relationship)

Around February, my brother got fed up with his horrible job and started looking for a new one. Last month, he got two job interviews in the same day and felt confident both would call him back. Because of this, he informed my partners and I, he intended to walk out of his current job. We all advised against it since even with the four of us we all live very paycheck-to-paycheck and neither job had given him a solid answer yet.

He walked out that day despite our warnings. Over the next week he awaited his call-back, which never came. He called both places and both said they were no longer interested in hiring him.

I was angry because he put our rental and general wellbeing at stake by taking a gamble on the jobs. Plus, put himself in jeporty of not being able to afford his meds. (Antipsychotics, for Bi-poler)

Today was his last paycheck and I brought us all together to run the numbers. We have $300 less in income than we have in outcome. Not good.

So we started running down what to remove. He had a doctor's appointment an hour away tomorrow which I was going to have to pay for the gas for. Money I don't have for another week. He cancelled his appointment no problem. He had enough meds and refills to last till the end of May, and by then he will very hopefully have a job.

He was fine with that untill he realized I had kept hosting Easter with my in-laws in the budget. Something which, I had agreed to do all the way back in December and had been preparing for since. (Including putting money aside, making plans, buying ingredients)

It'll be tight but the money for the get-together is coming out of my income, not his. And he does have meds going forward. And either way, he's the one who decided to quit his job despite warnings.

But now he's calling me an asshole for putting a holiday get together before his doctors appointment. Pointing out it wouldn't matter if I canceled since my in-laws would completely understand.

I know my in-laws would be okay with me cancelling but I don't feel like it's fair for him to ask me to cancel something I planned ahead for and was looking forward to because of his poor decisions.

Any other time his health always come first, and I have pitched in before to make sure he always has what he needs, even when it meant it was tight for my partners and I. AITA?

Update: I'll be talking to him about this very soon, as shown to me by the people of this thread and several people in my life IRL. This behavior has been very much a pattern with him, despite my best efforts to put a stop to it. It's time for a real talk about it.

I asked husband later and he confirmed she was right, he just didn’t want to tell me.

I feel like the name is ruined for me now. It doesn’t feel right calling my baby that now knowing that she liked the name and that they had chosen it for one of their sons.

18747,Not the A-hole,"I recently finished an internship and undertook training for the first 3 weeks. My trainer (T) was a male, I assume in his 60s, and very condescending. One time, he yelled in my face when I did something wrong, which ended up making me cry, and he then made fun of me for crying to some colleagues. He would sneak into the room when I was concentrating on something, and slap me really hard on the back, then tell me off for being so “on edge”. There are many more stories like this, but I think you get the idea. 

At the end of training, I needed to send feedback, and I had kept notes as the training went on so I had specific examples to refer back to. I made sure in the feedback to keep it professional, and not make it a personal attack on him. I sent in the feedback and his manager (M) replied before I finished work for the day, saying she’d like to meet with T and I the following day. 

After I had finished work that day, I received an email from T. He was absolutely wild about my feedback and called me a lot of names such as “dearie”. The email was very much a personal attack. I showed the email to about 3 people and they all told me it was inappropriate for the workplace and I needed to contact HR. I did, and HR were not at all impressed.

I then had the meeting with M and T. M told me that I should’ve gone straight to her, and left HR out of it. She said the 3 of us could’ve had a chat and smoothed out some issues, but since I had gone to HR this was now on his “permanent record” as a formal complaint. She said it was T’s birthday that day, and Christmas was coming up so it just really wasn’t in the spirit of things to make a complaint. T said that it’s easy for females to get in a temper and write things in a hot-headed state. A lot of back and forth happened, and M eventually finished the meeting by asking ME to apologise to T for causing him this unnecessary emotional stress. I did so (because I was worried for the sake of my job) but I was dumbfounded. 

My manager had a meeting with me after he heard about this. He said I need to accept that older men have a mindset that isn’t going to change, so I just need to deal with it. He said there’s a time and place for the truth, and you need to understand office politics before you involve HR.

This perspective stunned me as all along I thought I had done the right thing by speaking up. I believe I did the right thing by being honest in my feedback, and I don’t regret calling him out for treating me like crap. However, was I right to involve HR? Did I jump the gun by going to HR before the meeting with M and T happened? I was keen to get an unbiased opinion on this, as although it was a few months ago I find myself thinking about it a lot. I don’t want to make this same mistake twice if it was the wrong thing to do, and I don’t want to create a “Karen” reputation for myself in future.

4442,Not the A-hole,"I don't think I am, but people have gotten upset with me in the past about it, several times, so now I'm asking. 

I (19f) enjoy going to bars with friends, I love the dancing and playing pool. But I don't drink alcohol. Some of my friends have pushed me a bit to try it in the past, saying that I would be 'more fun' (I took some offence to that) if I had a few drinks. Most of them are okay with it now though. 

But a few times people who I've chatted with in the bar have gotten me drinks, and have taken super offence to me not accepting them. I've been told that I should just drink it to be polite, or that I shouldn't be in a bar if I don't drink. Bugging me about 'just giving me one good reason why I don't drink.' 

Plus just in general conversation (usually in bars, not always) people can get exceedingly pushy about wanting to know why, as if it's some strange thing. No one bugs me about not smoking cigarettes, but alcohol seems to be some weird thing when you say no. 

So if they keep pushing for an answer I give them one, usually in a sad backstory form. Because I don't want to share the real reason, and some people just won't take no for an answer.

2751,Asshole,"We have two daughters, Jody who is 26 and Hanna who is 28.

Both of them are engaged to two wonderful men who we adore.

My wife and I have saved roughly $50k for each daughter as a wedding fund. We aren't rich people so it took us years of being careful with our finances to help pay for half their college and this wedding fund.

We sat down with both my daughters separately to talk about their wedding plans. They did not know we had a fund for them. This was probably our first mistake.

Hanna immediately said she did not want a large wedding and would rather save money for a house deposit. She was going to do a courthouse wedding followed by a reception next year. So my wife and I agreed we would give her the wedding fund for that purpose. Again, we didn't communicate any of this with her. A huge mistake in hindsight.

Jody wanted a decent sized wedding. Something the fund would've covered.

My wife and I decided to pay for several of our family members from out of the country to attend. We knew it would be expensive but we knew we were only having one traditional wedding and we hadn't seen some close family close to 20 years.

Unfortunately, the costs started going out of control and we ended up taking $15K out of Hanna's wedding fund to cover the difference. At the time, we felt ok doing this because the extra costs of the wedding were due to our decisions, not Jody's.

The wedding happened a few weeks ago and it was perfect.

The problem now is that Hanna is aware we paid for most of her sister's wedding. She isn't aware about the costs and that we had to use some of her wedding fund.

A week after her sister's wedding, she came to us and said she changed her mind after seeing how beautiful it was. That she too wants a wedding like that with all of our extended family.

My wife and I had to tell her there was no way we could pay for all the extras again because we thought it'd be a once in a lifetime situation. We told her we'd be giving her around $35k for a house deposit and hosting her reception at our home.

Hanna had a complete meltdown and accused us of playing favorites. She left in tears.

She is now telling us she's too busy to meet for dinner or lunch when she used to drop by a few times a week.

This situation has now reached other members of our family who are chiming in.

This has been killing us. My wife told me we should just take the other $25k-30k from our savings to make this smooth over.

A part of me agrees but a larger part of me is angry that we have to mess with our retirement just because Hanna changed her mind. And I know part of her decision change is because of the constant competition our daughters have had growing up.

Bear with me on this one..

A few months ago my dad bought a new car, out of the blue, because it was cheap, he didn’t need a new car nor could he really afford it but he did it anyway. So I assumed he had sold his other to cover the cost..wrong!

He has kept this 10 year old car, on the drive, not moving not starting it up, for about 6 months with the promise it would be given to my sister (19) when she passed her test. 

That would be great and all, except my sister hasn’t shown any interest in driving at all since she failed her theory test. She’s on a low wage and can’t afford lessons, which makes me question if she could even afford to run the car.. I understand that she will eventually want a car when she can drive but from the looks of that’s years off. 

The car now doesn’t start (I just tried to move it off the drive so I can park mine - for context we have a 2 car drive and 3 cars, mine, dads and this shitty one, so one of us always has to park on the road). It’s just collecting dust, losing value and is just generally in the way - I can’t even wash my car because the hosepipe only reaches the first parking spot which the shitty car is in. 

To be honest the car would only be worth about £1k, which is actually money my dad could really do with as he’s currently separating from my mum so we’ve gone from a 2 income house (supported by rent from me) to a 1 income house and I pay more rent.

11244,Asshole,"This is pretty simple. At some point after our marriage, my wife went from brushing her teeth twice a day + flossing, to no longer flossing, to brushing only once a day, and finally, brushing once every other day. Her justification has always been ""I forgot"" in the morning or ""I'm too tired"" at night (even though she can lay in bed on her phone for 10+ minutes before calling it quits). For the past 6 months, before we go to bed, I will say ""Did you brush your teeth?"" and she will say ""No"" in a bashful way. I will tell her, ""Go brush your teeth"" and she will respond with ""I'm too tired"". I will then end up making a typical frustrated 'ugh' sound. And it's true she is usually tired. She works 12+ hour shifts and sometimes brings her work home. One day off a week, so she's working 65+ hours a week. But I'm not asking her to workout or do some life altering task. It's just brushing your teeth!

&#x200B;

Every now and then, I will let her know she's gonna end up in a bad spot with her teeth and any procedure she get is not only gonna be painful, but expensive too despite having dental insurance. This went on for 6 months and a month ago, she started having some bad pain in her mouth. She went to the dentist and turns out she needs a root canal. I know root canals are no joke. I had one when I was 11, and after all the pain and vomiting during those multiple procedures, I swore to take care of my teeth. Since then, zero cavities (we're 27 now).  So when she told me she will have to get one, I think she expected me to feel sympathetic, empathetic, and sorry for the trouble she will be going through. What ended up coming out of my mouth was ""And whose fault is that?"" along with a ""You have no one to blame but yourself"". This set off a small argument and she hasn't spoken to me for a full 24 hours.

&#x200B;

I'm just having a hard time feeling sorry for her. In fact, I feel pissed about it. This could literally have all been avoided. And if for some reason she needed a root canal despite her brushing everyday? I definitely would've felt bad for her. But she brought this on herself.  I reminded her often to brush her teeth, I warned her, I talked to her about it over 6 months and she didn't listen. Now that it's all a reality, she wants me to feel sorry for her. I'm not her parent and she's not a little kid. She's an adult and she should know better to keep playing with ""fire"" like that.

I get the total bill a couple of weeks later and it is over $22,000. My insurance covered none of this because at the time I needed 300 work hours for it to kick in and I only had 156 hours. I already know that it is going to be basically impossible to pay this because I can barely pay my rent as it is. Bankruptcy is not an option because I already went bankrupt 3 years ago in a similar situation over a 13mm (0.512 inch) kidney stone.

So am I the asshole in this situation for saying to myself that there is absolutely no chance that hospital is getting paid by me? I hate that I'm not able to pay them. Every single person involved in my care was highly professional and they deserve to be paid well for the work they did.

Edit: Thank you everyone for their responses. I'm going to attempt to do the right thing and contact the hospital to see what my options are. I want to see the everyone at the hospital get paid but I honestly cannot see how that can happen. I will at least make a good faith effort to reach out and talk to them.

And to everyone saying I need to change my diet and drink more water to prevent these stones, fuck you. I hydrate just fine. I have a family history of kidney stones so there is a genetic factor in why I get these. Though to be fair I haven't been able to get a personalized diet or have my stones analyzed because that costs money I do not have. The ER doctor did tell me however that the cause for 90% of kidney stones is not known.

It is a good idea overall to drink more water though so in that light I appreciate the suggestion.

And also thank you to everyone showing their solidarity for me.

Social and sweet, but somewhere along the line, something snapped in him. He is friendly to his family, but will growl and bark and snap in crowds. 

Things took a turn for the worse two months after I had my son. We went over for a visit, and before we could even take our coats off, this dog shoved past us, put his nose into the car seat, and snapped at the blanket covering him. We left immediately. I was under the impression the dog would have been put away before we came in, but even after he had been locked behind a gate, he was growling and trying to get past it.

My mom recently moved into a larger home, and insisted we try to come over one more time. She had him behind a heavy duty gate. I was bouncing and playing with my son, and he was squealing. The dog started up again, snarling and barking. My mom told me to... stop playing with my son and be calmer... being calm and quiet isn’t exactly in a baby’s skill set.

A couple weeks back I suggested to my mom that maybe she should rehome him. This dog is taking over her life. She says she can’t be away from home more than two days in a row because it will upset him. The dog will attack her other two dogs if they get more attention than him. She has spent over $1000 on his medicines and psychiatry appointments for him (I kid you not... A dog psychiatrist.)  She previously put him through a $500 training course.

I understand loving an animal, but this is extreme. My mom, sister and father vehemently defend their decision to keep the dog. Saying that no one else would take in a dog with special needs, and that he’d inevitably be put down. But I think if he had a house where it was just him, no other pets and no kids, he would be much happier. And if not... maybe he should be put down if he’s that much of a threat to people.

I don’t want to take my son over to their house anymore at this point. Am I the asshole for telling my mom that the dog needs to go?

In the middle of January my wife's family moved into the basement when their former home was condemned and their temporary housing ran out. The family consists of Mom (50s), Dad (50s), three brothers (from 19 to late 20s) and her trans sister (mid-30s) The only source of income for the entire family is dad's military pension.  Besides Dad, the only one who has any work history is the eldest. She sold cell phones for an electronics retailer for about a year, however it is now several years since she has worked.   


My basement is finished, has a second kitchen, but no bathroom, so we must share the only bathroom in the house which is on the second floor. There are many trips through our family room to go upstairs. Cleanliness has been an issue as well, there have been several times that I've found urine and feces on/around the toilet. Today, when I went to take a shower I found feces all over the shower... on the floor, in the drain, and the wall.  


At this point I feel like we are enabling their lifestyle, but also delaying the inevitable. I've asked my wife to have them leave by May 1 (I did this several weeks ago) but now as the day approaches I feel very guilty for returning them to homelessness.

I have a few tats that I got prior to meeting my husband. I enjoy them, but they’re mostly small and always covered. Recently I decided that I wanted to get a larger one on my back - I could still keep it covered but it’s one that I’ve wanted for a long time. Now my husband isn’t very fond of tattoos, but he doesn’t really have a problem with the smaller ones. We talked about it and he told me to do whatever makes me happy because it’s my body, but he was very clearly not happy with my idea. I thought about it and decided that I would get it, so I scheduled the appointment and had it done a few weeks later. 

After getting the work done, I’m very happy with the way it turned out. My husband however doesn’t share the same feeling and he’s been acting differently since. He isn’t being a jerk about it, but he seems to be more distant and it feels like he doesn’t really want to talk to me outside of necessity. Prior to this we talked nonstop about everything. We haven’t had sex since and he seems really uninterested in it. He still says he loves me, but I honestly don’t think he’s attracted to me physically the same way he was before.

My aunt is not happy with this fact I don't know where she reads things but she is suggesting to me and to my parents to do various things before I die like.

2)Writing a letter to 40+(all extended) family member. I don't want to spend my time writing a letter to relatives I didn't even meet yet.



3)Spend time with my friends(karting, baseball etc). When I told her I don't have any friends she suggested me to go with her son's friend. I dont want to do that too.




She was really angry when I rejected her every proposal and rambled about I am dying without enjoying life etc. For the next part, I think I am kinda TA she was once charged with drunk driving and has a terrible driving record.

5359,Asshole,"My ex-boyfriend and I broke up over his strange obsession with ""furry"" stuff. 

That he was a furry came to me as a total shock after a long, almost entirely positive relationship that I exited feeling somewhat disgusted with myself for possibly (likely?) being shallow. Truthfully, it was sort of a bait and switch since he never mentioned his furry obsession at all until like 8 months into the relationship. I would have never considered pursuing a serious relationship with him had I known the extent of how creepy it would be to me. I did, in ernest, try to reconcile, but, in the process, the relationship fell apart.

Over the course of explaining why we broke up, dozens of times to different people, it slipped out to maybe one or two gossips, by accident, that the particular reason we broke up was his strange fetish/hobby.  

Most likely due to the breakup more than the concurring incident of exposing him as a furry, he has gained substantial weight and has shown some signs of depression. I honestly tried to maintain a friendship, but it kept getting wierder and wierder. There's a mix of sad and angry between both of us, but something that comes up way more often than it should was that I was responsible for outing him as a furry. 

I apologised for everything and anything and he refuses to accept any attempt at reconciliation at any point. Most of our mutuals genuinely didn't care or laughed it off if they found out. I never went out of my way to frame him as a wierdo and He never once asked me to keep it a secret, despite hiding it from me for so long. I honestly suspect his overly offensive reaction is more an overreaction to the rest of the situation.

Am I the asshole?

20574,Not the A-hole,"I am the founder of a reasonably popular site in my country. We help students, particularly those who cannot afford good education, through online classes, and it's bittersweet to say that we have blown up in popularity due to the virus. As a side effect, I also have to manage a decent amount of people, something I never really expected. 

About half of my staff is comprised of women. Since I wanted them to be at ease, I told them to never worry about calling in sick for work or make up any ridiculous excuses if they have a period. They can chose to come and work if it's not a hassle. If not, they would be fully compensated. They were expected to work from home, but at the fraction of the normal output they give. If their period pain turns out to be too much, then they can email me and I shall urge them to rest. 

I thought this was fine, but my assistant told me that the number of paid leaves had been increasing for 4 consecutive months at a pretty high rate. So I just set out a word of caution to not misuse the leaves since I was acutely aware of this happening. I am very chill with my staff. A lot of them were my college batch mates  and I thought it would be the end of it. 

Funny enough, one of the women shows an Instagram group which had 7/8 of the women in our team. 2 of them actively participated in the group, used extremely bad language and sent photos about how they were partying/going to the theater/visiting a water park?! during their 'period' leaves. They were talking about how they would keep on screwing my naive, spineless ass. 

This hurt me, because I honestly started this with good intentions. I remember my mom being in absolute agony during her periods due to her cysts. I just wanted these people to know that I had their back and their job wasn't going anywhere.

While I understand that this was only 2 people, all of them were complicit in not notifying me about the matter even though they were a part of the group. 

So I wrote a stern email redefining the rules. I expected them to have a far higher output if they decided to stay home, or show me a medical certificate if they still expect the same output. If they refuse to do so, strict action will be taken against them. 

I am also planning on firing both of the employees. Mainly because they also posted far fewer lecture modules on average and blatantly lied to me. 

Since this is the first time I am doing something 'bossy' to people I had considered friends, I am extremely stressed out and wondering if I am taking things too far.

15629,Not the A-hole,"Look, before you click the title and type YTA, let me state my case.

I'm an Northern Irish guy living and working with my girlfriend in England and while we have a nice house and a dog, the neighbours kids are terrorising us and getting their parents to threaten us when we don't bow to their every whim.

Over the past year, the kids in the estate kick a ball against our high wooden fence nearly everyday, the noise it makes is annoying but we can live with it. However, sometimes the children kick the ball over the fence and come knock on our door to get the ball back, again it doesn't bother us too much.

Recently however, the kids have been kicking the ball over numerous times in the day and I work hard 9-5 so surely it's understandable that sometimes I couldn't care less about the ball, especially when the kids are rude to me and swearing at me when I give it back to them. So one day after retrieving the ball 5 seperate times and witnessing one kid attempt to climb my fence and get into my garden, I issue an ultimatum, if the ball lands in my garden again then I'm keeping it til the following day and then they can get it back.

The kids went and told their parents that we took their ball and won't give it back so here comes two parents knocking on our door yelling at us to give their ball back. Me and my gf protest saying they are damaging our fence, being rude to us and we insist that we are being reasonable qbut the parents keep saying the same thing ""give them their ball back now"", except more and more forcefully each time.

So what am I meant to do? Live my life as the defacto ball boy of the estate, eternally returning the balls back to their selfish, demanding owners under coercion by their parents?

Now I should preface this next bit by saying that I'm aware that my next actions could make me an asshole and I would normally agree, however, I would argue that I'm not THE asshole in this situation.

After having some kids dad come to my door and square up to me, I had enough, clearly noone bar us are interested in having a reasonable conversation about playing with a ball in the middle of a busy road (when there are 2 perfectly good parks 1 min down the street) or respecting other people's space so when the ball came over the fence last, I grabbed my sharpest kitchen knife and sank it into the football so to emulate a nail puncture. I step on the ball and squeeze a load of air out with my foot and then throw it back over the fence, making a much harder thud when it hits the ground 

Now I know this is petty and immature but I've had enough of acting as a surrogate parent to these whinging little shits and I feel someone should at least teach them that actions have consequences, especially if their own parents couldn't GAF.

Edit: on reflection I do feel bad, mostly because the gf thinks I'm the asshole for using her good knives but I was a wee shit when I was young so I can't judge them too harshly.

UPDATE: just got home from work and the neighbourhood kids asked if i can go get their ball again, I said I'll have a look. Then I just told them it's not there.

We were texting as usual. At the next hotel, I called her again. My friend came into the shot, the mood changed and the call ended. We talked again later and she seemed ok so I figured, whatever was wrong might be about something going on at home. For the rest of the trip, I continued to call/message and all I received were curt responses. I took it as a hint that maybe she's forcing me not to talk and to go enjoy my trip (she's told me to do so before). Returning home, my GF is distant. I tell her about my trip, showed her all my photos and videos. Talked about my new friends and the hookups they got into. She then tells me she didn't know I was sharing rooms with my friend. I'm deadpan confused and she tells me not to play this surprised card on her. WTF. The trip took months to plan and I reminded her of the calls to the tour group, organizing and getting on the same flights, tour dates and accommodations. She said booking doesn't mean sharing a room.  I reminded about the docs but she said she didn't want to access them because it seemed like a private. She said it seemed that I was intentionally not telling her, that I was deceitful because I should have known her jealous tendencies would need me to spell it out for her.

I can walk and jump but I can’t run or joy without lots of effort and pain in my joints. 

Anyway today I went on a dog walk with my mother (44) and my sister (12). My sister has a brain tumour, diagnosed just a few months after me. Unlucky, I know. She has to wear a splint on her leg and has extremely limited movement in her right arm and leg. 

Halfway through the walk our dog, who’s an 18 week old puppy runs to see a dog. My mum is holding the lead and lets go, meaning our puppy can now run off to see the other dog. My mum has for some reason come out wearing sandals and therefore can’t run after him. She doesn’t even make the effort. She instantly looks back at me and yells ‘well run then!’ I say back: ‘I can’t!’ I give a desperate attempt to jog but it hurts too much to run. Our puppy at this point is simply wagging his tail 5 feet away and sniffing the other dog. Not moving anywhere. My mum walks up to him and grabs his lead, then looks back at me and says, ‘it’s like I have to babysit for you all the time. You can’t do anything by yourself. It’s like you’re a 5 year old.’ On tip of this my sister who 100% would’ve even tried to get the dog if she could said,’if I had my other splint on, I would’ve ran for it mum.’ Which my mum replies to with, ‘I know you would’ve, I know.’ Which makes me so frustrated because they always favour my sisters side over me no matter whether she’s right or wrong.

The rec league is advertised as a just for fun, no score keeping activity where all the kids get equal playing time. It was a good fit for my son because he isn’t particularly athletic. Once the practices started, it was pretty clear to him (and me) that he wasn’t very good, but he enjoyed it and made a friend on the team.

Things went bad at the first game. The coach was keeping score and was playing the talented kids for significantly more of the game. He was also fighting with the refs (who were maybe 13) over calls and picking apart the kids’ every move. 

I took him aside after the game and asked him if he could stop keeping score and playing some players more than others, as it was against league rules. He told me that if I wanted my kid to play, I should practice more with him and it’s my own fault that he’s not being played. For the record, practiced a bit with my son when he wanted to, but the point of him joining soccer was for him to socialize and run around, and I didn’t want to push him to focus all his time on soccer because I didn’t want him to stop enjoying it. The league was supposed to be fun.

I went to the head of the league and asked her to switch my son to a different team. She asked why and I told her. She told me that it would be taken care of, and it turned out that the coach was dismissed and the assistant coach took over. She was much more of the kind of coach I expected for the league.

The problem is that word got around to the other parents that I was the one who complained, and many of the parents are mad that I got the coach dismissed because he was making their kids better at soccer and wasn’t a “participation trophy” kind of guy. I think if they want that kind of competitive energy, they should enroll their kids in the travel leagues in town. My ex has also confronted me about this and thinks I should’ve pushed my son because he could get a scholarship if he’s good at a sport.

So last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. 

He didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice ""heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake"" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. 

My side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. 

His side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first.

I feel like since ive been doing so well since I haven't been in contact with him that it would be a bad idea and probably a trigger to see him again

17760,asshole,"There has been a ton of drama in my family, and my mother has been in the middle of much of it. A few years ago three big things happened. My grandmother passed away, my grandfather got remarried, and my mother and grandfather got into a fight. 

Now, to keep a very long story short, my mother was living in one of my grandfather's houses to try to escape a bad situation and my brother moved with her. A mix of complicated family drama, and the introduction of a new step-mother, ended up exploding. This caused a fight with my brother and my mother moving out. On top of that, family members and the step-grandma had started to remove family heirlooms and some of the most valuable stuff disappeared. To protect what was left, my mother moved a large amount of heirlooms related to family history with her. I've been through it, and nothing I've come across had any monetary value. I've also talked to my grandfather and while he wasn't happy about it he didn't demand the items be returned. That said, the fight with my brother and mom, and her exit, made him angry enough to write my brother out of the will. 

Now, my mother has made several conflicting comments. She has said she might have also been written out of the will, and (to confuse everything else) all of her children might have been written out of the will. She has also said only my brother was written out. She has also said that I should expect a large amount of money from grandpa when he passes, but that may or may not depend on if his current wife survives him, and it may or may not depend on if my mom survives him (she has cancer). 

I have received a few heirlooms from my mother already, but now I am really confused about if I need to expect something else or not. I really want to call up my grandfather to get everything clarified. I have visited with him personally since the drama, and it was a happy meeting, but other than that distance and life has prevented me from calling regularly just to talk.

Would I be an asshole to call my grandfather just to ask about possible inheritance?

EDIT: Thanks for the replies. I thought it would be an asshole move, but sometime you have just have to get that confirmation to push you away from doing anything stupid. Yes, I'll call him to say hi and tell him I miss him. No, I don't think he owes me anything but I am concerned and confused about something that could potentially create big drama. Yes, he has his will and testament set up and the only person on that side of the family I trust is his executor. No, I don't think sit around and think about how I can get my hands on his money, but I am cursing my mother for being an asshole in more ways than one, especially in how she has gotten me confused about it all.

Its just easier to call him my stepfather. 


So my stepdad and my mum had a baby when I was 17. 

My brother is now 6 years old and lives together with me, my sister and our mother in an apartment so he's the only male in the household. 
His father lives a 5 minute walk away from us. 

My brother loves wearing dresses and high heels every once in a while, unicorns and butterflies, loves glitter and pink and all the stuff his father calls 'girly'

But brother also likes cars, trucks and big machines, play fighting and stuff like that. 

My stepfather has a problem with his son liking 'girl stuff' and that we are raising him to be a faggot, since living together with 3 adult women who let him play whatever he wants has a bad influence on him and he will turn out to be gay

My mother and my sister ignore comments like this from his side, but I usually fire back stuff like 'Better gay than being an alcoholic' and similar comments mentioning his drinking problem. 

He lost his job and drivers license due to his addiction a year ago and doesn't see the problem with it. He is bringing our brother in danger (when cycling with our brother he will just be reckless and doing dangerous stuff and my brother will copy him of course) and show him how to load a gun (which is also illegal in my country) so he's barely allowed to see his son. Especially not alone. 

My mother and sister think I'm being an asshole to mention his addiction when he says idiotic stuff like this and I should just ignore it but I think he's an asshole for calling his son a 'soon to be faggot'

I don't have a problem with my stepdad in general and I don't hold a grudge against him. 
When he's nice and normal I'm able to talk with him to in a friendly tone. I'm only like this when he talks shit about my brother and the LGBTQ community.

Naturally, I thought she was probably someone 24-25 (for reference, my brother is a senior in high school and just turned 18). But then he tells me how this woman is 32 and has a daughter that goes to the elementary school our other (younger) brother goes to. 

Naturally I’m concerned for him. This woman is almost double his age and preying on a high schooler. For reference, I’m 25 and thinking of sleeping with someone under 19 actually makes me viscerally ill.

10633,Not the A-hole,"One of my friends has been on a dry spell recently, let’s call him Mick. Mick has contracted both genital and oral herpes from an unfortunate drunk hook up years ago. 

He was upset afterwards that the girl didn’t warn him beforehand - which I believe is relevant for the story. 

He’s been wanting to get back into dating and told me that women tend to unmatch him immediately when he mentions his STDs. It’s understandably frustrating, but I felt it’s good on him for being upfront about it. 

That changed with his last tinder encounter. Mick told me she’s a great girl - pretty, funny, witty. He was *really* excited about going on a date with her and I assumed he had told her about his herpes situation (as he with other girls before). 

We arranged a double date, Mick and Tinder Girl, as well as my partner and I. Things went well in the beginning, we were having a great time and I could definitely feel the chemistry between the two. 

However, here’s where I might have been an asshole: Mick and my partner went outside for a cigarette, so Tinder Girl and I were the only ones at our table. We ended up talking about Mick, and I mentioned how excited he had been about the date, especially since he hadn’t exactly been lucky on tinder so far. She couldn’t see why, since he was great guy and she enjoyed the date so far. 

Mind you, we’ve had a few drinks at this point and I told her that he’s had a lot of girls unmatch him due to his ‘situation’. She was confused and asked me what I meant, so I told her that I meant his herpes. 

She got upset and told me that he hadn’t told her, despite her specifically asking about STDs. Apparently, Mick claimed to be entirely clean. 

She thanked me and stormed out, sending Mick an angry message and later blocking him.

Mick said I ruined his chances of scoring that night and is *really* upset with me. He said it was not my place to say anything and I should’ve given him the chance to tell her - but honestly I don’t think he would’ve (given that he specifically lied about it on tinder when she asked). I feel bad, at the same time I think she deserved to know beforehand.

Anyway, our manager got a phone call at 8:45 that a party of 12 wanted to come in and dine and set up a table for them in another servers section. She did not want to take the last table as her section had cleared out and she was all done. So I volunteered to take the table without knowing who they would be. Being the tail end of spring break was a gamble as they could have been a big cheap family full of kids and totally not worth it. 

But, when the party walked through the door, at 8:55pm, I easily recognized the gentleman as a regular of ours who owns several high end car dealerships across the country. They ordered high end wines and I had to service them properly before taking their food order; I work for tips after all!

By this time it is 9:20 and the chef is still awaiting the food order, entire kitchen crew is upset they have to stay longer for one table. Not my fault as my manager is the one who allowed the late reservation. 

Finally got the food order and the chef and kitchen crew pump out the fastest meal I’ve ever seen out of that kitchen. They all enjoyed their food, ordered more wine and racked up quite the bill. I didn’t want to add gratuity to the check knowing this guy always throws down extra. So I drop him the bill around 10:30, by this time all other crew members had gone home leaving me to clean the table and do all the work myself.

5934,Not the A-hole," My husband and I have been married for about 2 years, with him proposing about 3 years ago. After we got engaged, a couple of people suggested I get my engagement ring insured. Husband bought the ring from a well-known chain jewelry store and has a warranty on it that covers damages but it wouldn’t be covered in the event that it was lost or stolen. I considered getting the ring itself insured but our renter’s insurance covers up to a couple of thousand dollars in jewelry so I figured additional insurance would only be worth it if the ring was valued well over that amount. Now I had an idea what the ring costs just from owning jewelry all my life and didn’t think it was more than that, but just to be sure I looked up the ring on the jewelry chain’s website rather than bring it to be appraised. I was right that our renter’s insurance was enough to cover the cost of the ring if it was stolen so I left it at that. 

Well a few weeks ago my SIL (husband’s sister) gets engaged to her long-time boyfriend and he proposes with a massive diamond that his whole family is still talking about. It is a beautiful ring and I told her and her fiancé that when they showed us at dinner. 

My husband immediately got defensive and started to say that even though my ring is smaller, he still paid a lot of money for it. I said I know and I love it and me complimenting his sister’s ring was not a knock against my own ring. 

For whatever reason, on our way home, he tells me he paid X amount of dollars for the ring and that’s all he could afford. But I know for a fact that’s not what he paid because I had previously looked it up. In fact, he more than doubled the actual price of the ring. I asked him if that was truly what he paid and he questioned why I was asking and I told him how I had looked into the price of the ring after he initially gave it to me for insurance purposes and it was listed at half that amount online. 

He then started saying well actually it wasn’t X amount, it was maybe Y amount, but really maybe Z amount on sale, etc. I just kind of nodded and decided to move on because it was clear he was lying and the price doesn’t matter to me and I didn't want to make him feel bad. He then angrily demanded to know why I looked up the price in the first place. I again explained about the insurance and told him that if I did get it insured, I would have had to have it appraised anyway and would know the cost. 

He’s still upset with me for doing this and thinks I think the ring is cheap and only looked it up to prove how cheap it was. This, of course, is not true, I love my ring and have always said so, but my husband is very annoyed I ""went out of my way"" to find the cost.

I live in a school district that recently had a seven figure sum just go missing. I don't want her to spend another 50 or 75k rewarding that bad behavior and money management. The district has been caught over paying for no bid Contracts to friends and family of school district employees. Why should my Fmil spend money when they had plenty that they lost and choose to over pay because of corruption. My daughters school recently gave many teachers pink slips in June only to rehire them in August to prevent the teachers from getting tenure as that saves the school money in benefits, including my friend and my daughters favorite teacher. 

My boyfriend is on board with me shutting his mother down. I don't think it's right. They lost over 1 million dollars. That's enough for 5 chromebooks for every kid in the district.

14221,Not the A-hole,"I \[21\] was never close with the cousin in question. Over a year ago, she moved to the city I live in to pursue her acting career.  I was nice to her when she first moved here because we're cousins and all but after I helped her move into her place and drove her to a job interview that was on the other side of the city, but after that she would constantly call and ask for rides. Since then, I've been distancing myself from her (screening her calls, making up excuses so I wouldn't have to hangout with her, etc). Before she moved here, we never really talked. Maybe a phone call once a year or a facebook message her or there. 

She isn't really close with anybody from her dads side of the family except her siblings. She never sees any family members and is always getting into fights with family members. This stems from the fact that everyone on her dads side of the family **really** dislikes her mom since her mom was having an affair when my uncle was on his death bed (it's been proven, 100% not an accusation). She also has a habit of making things all about her (which honestly really irritates me).

**The issue**: She called me yesterday at work and asked if I wanted to go out for supper with her and her friends for her birthday. I really didn't want to since I had a final after work and had been up since 5:30 am but she said it would be after my final. So I decided to be nice and go out for supper with her and her friends for her birthday. Everything was fine until she brought up my dad.

Her and my dad don't really talk and don't get along. She mentioned to her friends how my dad and his twin (my uncle) both married Filipino ladies.  I love both of them to death. She has never met either of them since she doesn't really talk to any family nor visits them. She then proceeded to tell her friends that my aunt **and** stepmom must be mail order brides and asked me if my step mom was submissive to my dad because apparently"" the men in our culture (Aboriginal) except women to be submissive (I've never seen this before in my life). The Aboriginal men in my life (grandpa, dad, uncles) have never expected any women to be submissive to them.

I proceeded to correct her and said that my step mom and aunt were **not** mail order brides. My dad and step mom met online and talked for about a year before my dad went to the Philippines to visit for the first time and then got married about a year after that. My uncle met my aunt in the city that they both live in. The fact that she told her friends this assumption without even consulting me really stuck with me and hurt me.

Besides that comment, she made some more comments (that she knew nothing about the situation) regarding our family which rubbed me the wrong way.

13220,Asshole,"My son’s 19. He doesn’t go to school, and has absolutely no desire to get an education or at least learn a trade. He wants to do nothing but stay at home and play video games and work his minimum wage job.

A few weeks, I started a conversation with him. I asked him where does he see himself, and what are his goals? He said he doesn’t know, just working (he works at Taco Bell right now). I told him that he needs to find some long-term goals and take steps in his life to achieve them; he can’t just sit in my house rent-free and without any ambitions. He said he understood and will try to.

Yesterday, I asked him was there any update and he just shrugged. I told him if he still doesn’t have any goals, he can’t just sit here and do nothing, and that he has a month to move out. Alternatively, he could join the military and he can continue to live here as long as he wants. He felt like it was unfair for me to push either of those things on him, and that I never threatened to kick his sister out (who goes to the local state school). I told him that she was actually doing something with her life, and I couldn’t see him waste his life like this, and that he has a month to decide what he wants to do.

Well he threw a tantrum and went up to his room. I knew the kid was gonna be upset, but I can’t just let him stay here and do nothing. The reason why I’m asking is that my sister called me about the situation (she’s sorta his mother-figure ever since his mother died when he was 7). She tried to tell me I’m being entirely unreasonable. I told her if she wanted to let him move in, she very well can, but at this point, my son needs a push to get started in his life, and I’m not going to raise a freeloader. We argued back and forth but neither of us could see the other’s side.

A few years back, my dad promised me to get tested to see whether hes allergic to cats/dogs. My mum and I have always wanted a cat, ny dad being the only hindrance. So, when he found out he didn't have hayfever before, he said he would get tested. So, me being around 13, I bothered him about it for a while until he snapped and said he'd never get it now. I was heartbroken since I'd gotten my hopes up. But I forgot it.

Ariynd 2.5 years later, I gave my dad a painting for his 50th. It was unfinished but I was planning in finishing it within the month. I later realised that I had overestimated my skill and lost the motivation to make it. I told my dad this and I started making a new one. Its finished now since I just finished college and have time. However during the year and a half, he talked about it, every. Fucking. Week. Like I'd have finished a big project for school, gotten a good grade, and his response would be ""and my painting?"".

It was especially bad around birthdays and Christmases. When he got my present, he'd  exclaim ""I wonder if this is the long awaited painting, actually it'd be cheap of you to give a present twice"". I never did this so it always hurt when he I did it.
Not only that, when I said I was going to pain something, he always said that it better be his, even though he knows I also have a big project that I want to give to my grandpa to his 80th. 


I finally snapped at his last bday and said I'll give ot to him when he gets tested for his allergies. He shut up. Because of all of this I've completely stopped painting and always feel guilty if I try.

3615,No A-holes here,"So my (35m) wife (35f) and I moved to her home country (medium income  country) around 2 years ago. My in-laws moved from the capital to the  province (1h flight) a long time ago and they had a house in the capital  that was unoccupied. Legally, the house has been transferred many years  ago to my wife but my in-laws still treat it as their house. We take  care of all taxes and costs related to the house (around 10k USD/year).  Half a year ago, my mother-in-law got really sick and my wife asked her  to come over to our place as medical care in the capital is way better  than in the provinces. She got diagnosed with late stage cancer and has  started treatment. My wife is her main caretaker and basically had to  pause her life to take care of her. She had been with us ever since and  probably has made up her mind she will stay here for years to come. My  wife and mother-in-law never had a good relationship and her being in  the house has put a lot of stress on everyone. On top of that my  father-in-law now drops by whenever he wants, sometimes staying up to  two weeks with us and treating it as his house. He has a business in the  province so can't stay with his wife here in the capital as the bills  needs to get paid. The business is not doing so well so we save him  quite a lot of money by taking care of the house upkeep that previously  was paid by him. However having my mother-in-law living in with us has  become unsustainable. So either we move out, leaving them with the house  costs and the care of my mother-in-law (which will be difficult as she  can't join my father-in-law in the province due to unavailability of  medical treatment and he can't join her here because of the business).  Or our preferred solution is to put my mother-in-law in an apartment  nearby with a caretaker (paid by us) and my wife checking on her  regularly on her. We all save money in that way and we can go back to a  healthier relationship with my in-laws.

The school gave us times to show up based off our last name, and my name was in the first group of people. We were limited one car per student which meant I had to invite only my family and boyfriend, 6 in total. There is already a lot of tension between my family so this was ought to be an awkward car ride.

I live with my boyfriend so I had to pick everyone up at my moms. Last night, everyone was checking in to confirm the time and place we would meet. My dad asked if we could go in his car, but I said no because my bf mom had already let us borrow her 8 seat car so we could all fit. Now, before this I had told him not to bring his gf because I wanted it to be just family and she never had made any effort to talk to me in the past. So I thought for this occasion it’d be okay to let my dad know I didn’t want her there. My dad is already a really untrustworthy person so when he started saying things like, “can I bring my car?” , “can I just meet you at the school?”, “I don’t want to see your mom at her house” I started to question if he was going to bring her. I mentioned again that I didn’t want her there in a stern text message and he completely ignored it. My mom had already said if she was there she would leave and I guaranteed her she wouldn’t be there. So I became anxious. I told my dad to meet us there at 9... I told everyone else to meet at 9:30. I wish I should’ve told him 8:30. 

It’s today now and I’m at my moms house. Everyone is there and ready at 9:30! I told my dad 9, he’s not there. We left before he got there because I dropped my tassel back at my bfs house so I text him and he meets us at the school. We’re late so we just end up getting in line without my dad and he meets us after for pictures. Except NOT. 

We park and I realize he was right behind us. I look in the passenger seat.... WHO DO YOU KNOW. It’s his gf. My mom and I got upset and she starts to say that she’s going to go home. I adore my mom and my dad has been shitty most of my life so obviously I’m going to choose her over him. I walk up to him and ask him why he brought her when I specifically told him not to. I really didn’t want to be mean, but he disrespected my wishes on the one day I’d see all of my family together. I tell him it’s not okay to be late and on top of that decide to bring her. I had to take time away from my celebration to call and text him because he decided he would show up after everyone else. And I sent him on his way.

I said I wasn’t trying to make waves I just really would understand the movie better if they turned them on. He again called me selfish, said that the subtitles are distracting and no “real director” wants them to be in a movie unless someone absolutely needs them to understand it. I was really upset at this point and he said, “I’m just sick of your shit, why don’t you just go to your room and everyone else can watch the movie?” Nobody, not even my parents, said anything at all, so they must have been really annoyed too.

Thankfully- I was able to get some money from my parents- $200, and I made a budget. So back when I had little to no money, I asked my roommate, who I'm really good friends with to buy some items amounting to $35 because I had to return some Amazon items and that would be my exact gift card amount. I asked her then- about two weeks ago, if it's okay to give her the gift card, and she agreed.

With those, and considering I have other small expenses that need to last me till the 27th. I made a tight budget, and then my roommate asked for the $35 dollars in cash- because she had spent too much money and she wanted to spend more without her parents knowing. I really can't afford that right now. Hopefully if the small supplies I need- find out the list of the art supplies I need on tuesday- if I have anything left over I can pay her.

The title probably sounds really silly. Hear me out.

I  am a 21 year old college student studying to become a practitioner in  the medical field. I am very busy with classes, studying,  extracurriculars, and work. My week is 7 days and I usually do not have a  day off in. My parents know this, as I live at home and have discussed  it with them many times.

Recently,  I had some blood work done that showed a slight thyroid abnormality but  the doctor decided not to treat it and recommended redoing bloodwork  when it was convenient for me to make sure everything was okay. I've  been working out when I can go for that blood work, and have a follow up  scheduled for December. Otherwise, I am perfectly healthy and function  normally day to day.

Flash forward  to last night. I come home and my parents are immediately (as soon as I  walked into the door) reprimanding me for not going back to the doctors  sooner (this conversation was out of the blue, as we were not  previously discussing). I told them I have a follow up made, and will be  making time to have bloodwork done soon. My dad got pretty infuriated  by this and it started an argument. It was late, I wanted to fit some  studying in before I went to sleep, and told him I didn't feel like talking about it much more and that we could discuss it the next day.

Today,  while I was in class, with no access to my phone, my parents begin frantically texting me to let me know they made a doctor's appointment for me, that I HAVE to go, and my mother reworked her schedule tomorrow to go with me and used her lunch period to call them.

My  parents did this without ever asking me or discussing with me if it was  possible with my schedule. In the past, my parents have issues  communicating with each other and have issues communicating with me. I  have tried working on this with them but they can be quite stubborn and  do not like to be wrong, especially my dad.

I  have two exams tomorrow at 9 am and 10 am respectively, which makes me unable to attend this 9:30am doctor's appointment. My  parents are extremely mad at me, which I don't this is fair considering  they did this without consulting me and asking if that time and day  works for me. I am fully capable of making my own appointments and  prefer to do so, and usually do. They haven't made an appointment for me  for anything since I was in high school.

I  appreciate their concern for my health, and love them dearly. I don't  want anyone to think that I don't appreciate their concern for me. I  always value their thoughts and options highly. My doctor did not feel  this needed immediate attention and ordered to come back in at my  convenience, given within the next few months.

After my divorce I focused on raising my daughters and ensuring they were good and well adjusted. Thankful that they are. Both are now graduated and successful engineers. A lot of sacrifices went into this both professional and personal for myself. This was my choice and the way I wanted it to be. No regrets at all as my children were my focus. So all good there. I moved back to my home city to raise them. My parents were instrumental in helping me and have been fully supportive. I could not have done it without them. I am truly grateful and appreciative. My town is small. Not a place for singles. Nothing much to do. Limited job prospects. The girls have moved away to a great city about 5 hrs drive away. Great place. Bigger lots of opportunities there on all fronts. For the past 16 years while being here in this town with my parents I have also taken care of their affairs. They are 80 now. Dad had a stroke 2 years ago. He is much better. So they have come to rely on me. I have one brother. He lives two hours away. He’s not involved much. I live in a big house. Need to downsize. Looking for a fresh start, new job, new opportunities, new relationships, friends etc. I’m at the point now where I can fully for the first time in my life at 56 look and put myself first! I’m excited to start a new chapter. But I have struggled with my parents. They are immigrants. Not much English. Not very worldly. Despite this I decided to move to the new city 5 hours away. I sold my house. Did really well financially. Got a cute apt in the trendy downtown core. Ready to go! Moving in a few weeks. My girls are super excited and thrilled for me. But not my parents. They are devastated. They don’t understand. They feel abandoned. I have asked them to move with me. There’s nothing keeping them here. But they won’t. They expect us to stay with them and look after them. It’s the cultural way. Despite this I am going. I feel hopeless and guilt about this decision. I am hoping they will change their mind and join me. For the maybe 20 good years that I have left, am I wrong?

5252,No A-holes here,"This one is simple, IMO: my fiancé and I are both from huge families. Our wedding invite list, before friends, is close to 400. Once we include friends it is well over that number. Even if we cut out nonessential family (lol) it is still over 300. We can’t afford that, and don’t want to. Her family is from a pretty expensive place to get to with a remarkably high COL and visiting. When we visited there early in our relationship that is where our relationship really took off. So, we threw around the idea of getting married there and her mother was absolutely thrilled. We made an announcement and a lot of our friends were super supportive and talking about saving money to go since the date is pretty far off (>2 years). 

Additional important info: we are getting really good pricing because of family connections in the location we are going to. Even if all 400 people showed up it would *still* be cheaper than having it in our home area. 

Now, one of our good friends is really insulted that we chose a destination, partially because we want to cut the number of attendees down and partially because a lot of college friends won’t go. Our thought is that we would love everyone to come, but understand if they can’t because it is expensive. We feel like assholes now because of this friend and simultaneously also are really annoyed at the entitlement of being able to attend the wedding in the first place. We are kind of tired of trying to appease everyone in our lives. 

So, are we the assholes here? Is our thought process stupid?

13932,Not the A-hole,"This is almost a ""How much of an asshole would I be...?"" Because I already feel this is wrong but I don't know if it's justified.

I've recently found out that this two girls (C and M) have been manipulating me and using me: whenever they had a problem with someone or something they come to me to solve it for them and everytime I refuse to do that they start yelling at me because I have to do it because of some bullshit reason. I'm also really bad confronting people so I always end up doing what they want. 

Another thing they do is ask me to give them my exercises and that's where my problem begins.

We were doing a group project and C and M told me to kick out of the group another classmate for ""not doing his part"" when they hadn't done theirs. I told them I didn't want to because they were being too hard on him since they also had a lot to do but they said it wasn't fair because at least they were working hard and he didn't even show up. 

So I ended up talking with this guy (T) and he tells me that he is doing the exercises in his own time but he couldn't meet up with us. C and M still talked shit about him and tried to make me not trust him and kick him out but I didn't listen.

In the end T and I ended up doing most of the project because M and C didn't finish the exercises on time but, even though the project is finished, they still had to do all of them so they can study for the exam. Today after complaining so much about T being lazy and saying how hard they have been working on the project (and I doubt that) they asked me to give them all the exercises from the project and the ones we did in class.

I'm so sick of this and everything else they have done so here's what I thought: the exercises are about programming so I can change a couple of codes and the program won't work. That way if they study they'll realise something's wrong and they'll have to make their own program but if they plan to copy what I did on the exam, they'll fail.

Is this too much? Would I cross a line? I've shared this with my friend and he says it's what they deserve but my mother and my sister think I shouldn't do it. Would I be an asshole?

14229,Not the A-hole,"Last night, I (20M) ended an almost two year long relationship with my girlfriend (19F), let’s say Kelsey, after she gave me an ultimatum that I need to attend church every Sunday or she would break up with me. 

Background: Kelsey knows my history with being forced to go to a Southern Baptist Church from the time I was born until I left for college, which is ironically about the same time we’ve started dating. Being forced to go to church services with messages I did not agree with pushed me away from religion instead of helping me develop a healthy relationship with God. 

Last year, during my first year of college, I only went to church a couple times throughout the year, mostly when Kelsey asked me too. Going to a Methodist church and hearing a different message of the gospel being preached was refreshing and I didn’t mind going whenever she asked. I had begun to grow a healthy relationship with the church and God again. 

During the first semester of this school year (Fall 2018), we went to church a few times again but nothing too seriously. She is a freshman and college and it took some time for her to adjust and figure out what she wants and needs. After winter break, she decided she wants to go to church more often and I support her 100%, as I believe in helping her grow as she needs to, and I’d even been attended church more too as I have been feeling much better about it again. 

The problem happened two weeks ago when Kelsey hit me with this ultimatum: either I start attended church every Sunday, or we break up. I took some time to think about it and realized that’s not where I’m at in my faith and if I start feeling forced to go to church again, it will ruin the relationship I have built back up with it. I tried to explain this and she countered that I truly just don’t want to grow and that I need to force myself to do it. I told her I could build up to going every Sunday but I can’t just flip a switch right now, and she said it’s something she needs long-term. I asked Kelsey to please stay with me and continue to support me by helping me build my faith as I have been doing so that this long-term relationship can happen, because I do love her and she truly makes me happy. She said she can’t do that and I have to fully commit myself how to going to church every Sunday because that’s what she needs in a boyfriend.  I told her I just can’t do that for her right now as it would feel as if I’m controlled and forced to go, despite my feelings on it. She wouldn’t budge even after I tried so hard to find ways to make it work. 

Eventually, I realized I was just beating a dead horse, and said that if there’s nothing we can agree on other than her way, I can’t do that right now. I feel that faith is a very personal journey and at 20 years old, that journey needs to be decided my right now.

16138,Everyone Sucks,"Title may sound a little simple but the issue is pretty complicated and I would appreciate some input.

I am a uni student living on campus and about four months ago, after a night out, a few friends and I went back to their accomodation. We were hanging out in their kitchen for a bit and when they said they were going to sleep I excused myself and headed out. On the the way out of the kitchen I saw a bottle of teriyake sauce and I just decided to take it with me for whatever reason.

It sat in my kitchen for a couple days, I didn't use it and didn't really know why I took it but because its only worth a couple pounds I wasn't really bothered about it. Then my mates messaged me telling me that the person whos it was wanted it back and so I went back and gave it to them.

Now four months later I recieve a letter telling me that I bullied this person by taking their sauce and they reported me and I must attend a hearing with the disciplinary committee. Well that was yesterday and whilst I thought I would get a slap on the wrist boy was I wrong....

They called me a thief,  said how would I like it if someone did that to me and even equated it to murder somehow to which I laughed and the police officer ripped into me for not taking the issue seriously. At the end they told me that I would recieve a university and a halls warning which I was blown away by. If I get one more of those it means I'll be kicked out of my accomodation and likely kicked out of uni.

So theres the story, and I was just wondering if ITA? I know I shouldn't have taken the sauce and being drunk isn't an excuse but I did return it and this sort of thing is always happening at uni, people use eachothers food and breaking stuff is a common occurrence. I really think this has been blown massivly out of proportion and don't think that a bottle of sauce should be threatening my place at uni. It means I can't really drink while I'm here because I might do something that I think isn't a big deal and get kicked out.

Edit: To people saying is that all I did, yes its literally just that. I have never met her or talked to her and when I returned it just gave it to my mate. She is meant to be a bit crazy or whatever but I don't really know because I haven't ever talked to her. I have not left out any details, this really is the full, random story.

Edit 2: Thanks for all the feedback guys, I always like it when an AITA has mixed views and its interesting people are divided from this. On reflection I do think its an asshole move from me to take it and Ill try to be careful with drinking and messing around in the future. I also should pay more attention and should have returned it immediately as eventhough my experince is that no-one cares there might still be someone who does. I do also think she is an asshole for not dealing with it in an adult way and reporting me ages later and escalating it when I had messaged her and was willing to converse and apolagise about it. Whilst I do think uni massively overacted, I now understand the position they're in and that they have to act on a report of theft. However I do think they had no right to intimidate me and be agressive during the hearing. I appreciate the feedback and Ill be much more careful in the future :)",115,141,0.93,AITA for drunkenly taking someones teriyake sauce and getting my position at uni threatened,b1dxnr,2019-03-15 11:47:20,ESH,3273,AITA
22174,Not the A-hole,"Literally 2 minutes since this happened, on mobile warning, the usual. 

My younger brother (14) keeps a drink next to his bed, pretty normal. This drink is in a plastic watermelon cup.

Now, because he's incompetent, he ""has to"" have someone else fill it and pass it to him (he can do it on his own, he just refuses to 99% of the time).

When he wants it filled, he will shout. What will he shout you ask?
""OI, BOY! WATERMELON!""

The irony of a 14 year old calling his older brother ""boy"" is not lost on me, but I deal with it.

So far, I have described a normal night; now for what happened tonight. 

Tonight, he screamed at me with the windows open while I was half-running to the bathroom before I shat myself (he was in there for 15 minutes while I filled the dishwasher); so I responded ""not now, I'm busy"".

His response to this was to: jump out of bed, shout again, and throw the cup as hard as he could at the now locked bathroom door. 

Now, tell me if I'm wrong, but I'm already pretty certain that he's an asshole at this point, but now enters my mum.

About 5 minutes later (nice crap, hand washing, and tooth brushing) I emerged from the bathroom and began to walk along the landing when my mum said ""are you going to fill his melon now?""

I responded with a quick ""no, I'm not going to stand for him shouting and throwing things at me to get what he wants.""

To this, she sighed, walked to the bathroom, and filled it herself (less than 30 seconds). While doing this she said ""you're an arsehole you know. You should have just done it and not made me do it.""

[4 minutes later] 

Mum walks past my door and says ""it would make life so much easier if you weren't an arsehole to your brother all the time""

I didn't respond, so she repeated it louder.

""Mum, I heard the first time""
""Well you should have responded then, arsehole""

And she walked away. 

At this point, I might as well change my legal name to arsehole considering how often I get called it, but oh well.

3461,Not the A-hole,"This was like 12 years ago but these kind of things stick with me forever.  I actually lost my job shortly after this and the belief was that it was tied to this incident. Perhaps I'm looking for peace of mind, perhaps I'm looking to be put in my place here.

I used to stock groceries for a major chain.  We'd come in after closing time and stock overnight.  Everybody would get 1 to 2 aisles.  Some aisles (like baking goods) with heavier items would be given to pairs.  I was bounced around a lot - I'd do frozen because I have a high tolerance for cold (I wore fingerless gloves handling ice cream because..im an idiot - not important). 

One co-worker I'd get paired with was a dude with a hearing disability.  Sometimes he'd get paired with a second person and sometimes he'd get a really easy aisle like greeting cards.  

One night he got placed with me on baking goods, lots of 20kg bags of sugar, flour, etc.  He had a tendency to fuck off and do his own thing. I'd constantly have to ask when I get a new pallet if anybody had seen him.  Sometimes he'd be taking an unannounced break. Sometimes he'd be in another aisle entirely rearranging things that were already stocked.  About 8 hours in I got fed up. He had unpacked about 3 cases of product all night while I was doing a ton of heavy lifting and hadnt taken even my standard lunch break because our boss was a dick and I wanted to make sure the job was done before I could relax.  I lost my shit at my supervisor.

(paraphrased, its been a while)

S: Why's there still 3 pallets to unload?

Me: I have no help.  This is a two man job. Why does (coworker) even work here if he doesn't stock shelves? 

S: You know he's deaf right?

Me: I don't care. Does deaf mean he can't open boxes? Last I checked you don't need to hear to put cocoa powder \*here\* (I slammed a tin on the shelf)  I get paid the same as he does but I'm doing 10x the work. This is bullshit.  I haven't even had a break tonight.

The rest of the night he was moved to a different aisle (i think he was putting binge items at the cashiers tils) and I was ""punished"" by working baking alone.  I barely got everything stocked - but my shifts started to reduce.  I was there for about another two weeks before a (seemingly) unrelated incident where a boss tried to grief me for not doing enough work (solo'ing another two man aisle), proceeded to unload a single pallet by himself to ""prove a point"" - to which I told him ""I'm supposed to be impressed it took you twice as long to do half what I do"" before walking out.

Parental dispute help here...... 

Caveat, I would NEVER leave my children in an unsafe environment EVER! But my wife insists that this situation is unsafe. I'll let reddit decide if I am an indeed an a**hole. 

On occasion, I will leave my 3 and 5 year old strapped in their car seats while I go inside to pay for gas and get snacks/coffee. I do ask my kids every time if they want to come in with me and they sometimes do, but most of the time they'd rather stay in the van to draw, color, or read. I'm fine with that choice. As most parents would tell you, getting into and out of car seats can be a hassle. 

When at our gas station, I always make sure....
-the kids are warned to stay strapped in their seats (they've never not heeded this warning).
-the van is off, and I have the keys
-the doors get locked 
-I'm at the nearest possible pump under the shaded awning
-I can see the van the whole time from the windows of the station.
-I'm inside 5 min. or less 
-the kids end up with a snack, too :). 

So is this a reasonable parenting practice or, as my wife sarcastically insists, CPS is going to start an investigation into my daddy decisions, and some bystander is going to call me an asshole for leaving my kids in the car. 

Am I an asshole?

Clarification: Several have asked...... I'm in Michigan, and I've never gotten back into the car after my 5 min. inside and the temperature had changed by more than a couple degrees inside the van (hot or cold). Also, if I see a huge line inside, I don't wait. 5 min. is the max I am away from the van.",206,141,0.9,AITA : Leaving kids in the car @ gas station,d6lx2f,2019-09-19 23:05:29,NAH,1560,AITA

18973,No A-holes here,"A few months ago, my (F32) brother Mario (29) got married to a lovely lady, Kate (29). Kate and her family are nice people, but they’re extremely formal, and can be a bit cold. My family, on the other hand, is extremely casual. We love to joke around and poke fun. I think if Kate’s family were to describe my family, there would be comments about propriety and lack thereof.

The day after the wedding, Kate’s parents hosted brunch at their house. When I arrived, I walked into the living room. Sitting there was Kate’s dad, her grandma, and my other brother. On the coffee table, there was a large serving platter. On the serving platter, there was a dip that had been prepared in a mold. You don’t see a lot of dip molds these days, so [here’s a visual](https://www.createdby-diane.com/2010/07/how-to-make-dip-more-appetizing.html) to give you an idea of what I’m talking about. This dip was a little different. It was about a foot long, in the unmistakable shape of a penis and testicles.

When I saw it, I thought I had misjudged my brother’s new in-laws. Food in the shape of dick and balls? What could be funnier than that? They had clearly been hiding their great sense of humour all this time. As soon as I saw the dip I burst out laughing.

“Something left over from the bachelorette party?” I said.

My brother’s father-in-law looked me dead in the eyes.

“It’s a lobster,” he said.

As other guests arrived, it became clear who was in my family and who was in Kate’s family. My family were all making thinly veiled penis jokes, while Kate and her family ignored us and pretended there wasn’t a giant dick on the table.

“So creamy,” my cousin said as she dug into the shaft with a cracker.

“They should have put some sprouts around the base,” my aunt said.

For months, I’ve been telling people the dick dip story, and anyone with a sense of humour thinks it’s hilarious. Last weekend, I had some people over to my house, and as a joke, I decided to make my own dick dip. Out of respect for my sister-in-law, who lives in a different city, I did not post any photos of the dick dip to social media. Some of my friends, however, couldn’t help themselves. Kate saw photos of the dick dip on a mutual friend’s Instagram story, and now she is upset.

I haven’t heard from her, but my brother called me and said I’m disrespecting her and her family. He says I need to apologize. In my opinion, I didn’t do anything wrong and Kate should lighten up. It’s a dip in the shape of a penis. Relax.

The basic situation is that I have a summer job as a waitress that I mostly like a lot... but there's this one regular who comes in that I really don't like to deal with. He's perfectly nice, best friends with the owner and everyone seems to like him. But whenever I'm his waitress he gives me kind of a bad feeling - he compliments me a lot, makes weird comments about my appearance, and asks sort of personal questions I don't want to answer. And it's tough because he's probably harmless, but again I'm just super uncomfortable serving him, and he always requests me as his waitress. 

So what I've been doing the last few times he's come in is either take my break or more often just pretend to be busy and ask one of the guy-waiters to take him instead. That also makes me feel bad, because it gives them more work when I should be the one doing it.

4447,Not the A-hole,"Okay so I (16m) was recently assigned a group project. We were supposed to work in group of 4s. Originally I was planning to work with 3 of my friends (2 of which were twin sisters) and the other was my best friend however the sisters had a family emergency that they had to miss school for a week for so it was just me and my best friend left. Therefore there was 2 empty slots in our group that to my utter dismay were taken by 2 obnoxious, bratty people but one of them moved groups like 10 minutes later. We had 3 people so we were already at a disadvantage. We had to write repprts on 16 different elements in the periodic table and each report had to be at least 1 page long. I said I would do 6 and so did my best friend so the other person had 4. They promised they would do it. It had to be handwritten btw.

I wrote my 6 reports that ended up being 2/3 pages each and my friend did his work, by the 3rd day (we had 7 days). Our other group member hadnt done his work yet but no big deal we still had time.

Also, the twins sent me 2 of the reports over discord and apologised and said they really couldn't do anymore and that I would have to handwrite it. So me and my best friend hand wrote one of the twins' reports each. This other guy had 2 reports to do and we told him that in person. By the 6th day he hadnt done it and he told me this at 6pm the day before it was due. His excuse? He forgot. What the actual fuck. Okay, fuck this guy I did all the work he should have done (my best friend didn't have time that day so he asked me to do them both and i didnt have a problem with that as he had already written 7 of them).

So i did it and me and my best friend handed it in. We informed the teacher how our other teammate had done nothing and showed him the texts and showed how none of their handwriting was anywhere to be soon. Luckily our group member didnt try to lie.

I complained to the teacher but he said he couldn't do anything about it even though he knew what happened.

Then this idiot started bragging about getting an A and me and my best friend were fuming.

Angrily, I went on twitter (where literally everyone in the school had each other added) and posted how he didnt do any of the work but how he got an excellent grade, and how people should try to avoid working with him as he was lazy and tries to tske credit. And I linked screenshots showing he admitted doing none of the work where he says he forgot.

Everyone starting replying saying ""spill the tea"", ""exposed"", ""how awful"", and stuff like that.

So I got really serious about losing weight in May of 2018 and been working hard since. About 2 months ago I started going to the gym daily to do aqua-aerobics. It allows me to burn myself out and not stress some of my mess up joints.

Well a few days ago the gym had a few people beyond us taking the class in the pool. The set up is at either end the pool there are dressing rooms, one side has the Men's Dressing Room with a shower next to the door and a bench next to the shower so you can place something to keep it dry as you shower off. Well as I head to the dressing room the whole bench and the area around it is full. A woman has 3 teenage kids sitting on the bench with stuff all around it covering everything.

As I walk closer I notice the woman has her back to everyone and is holding up a towel in front of her. I wonder, huh, what is that - until I notice a pair of blond little pigtails pop up and it strikes me.

The woman is holding a towel so her little girl could change RIGHT NEXT TO THE MEN'S ROOM!!! On the other side on the pool there is a huge sign that says Woman's Dressing Room, and next to it FAMILY DRESSING ROOM - and next to them was another bench with shower- which were sitting totally empty.

As I walk up the woman give me a dirty look. I mention to her that there is a dressing room right on the other side she could be using and that changing her daughter in front of the men's dressing room was not the best place to be doing this.

Last year my daughter married a black man. It doesn't matter to us but I guess it's relevant later. We never really liked him because he has an annoying personality but he seems to think it's because of his race (most certainly not). We do all tolerate each other though.

My grandson started walking at 9 months and ever since he's been jumping and climbing on top of anything he can so my husband and I started calling him our little monkey. He loves the name as well so it wasn't a problem. Till recently however, when her husband came and confronted me on it and said it was grossly inappropriate to call him that. I apologized for how he felt on it but as long as my grandson likes it, I will keep using it. He then spent a hour grilling the poor child even after he said he liked the name.

Now my daughter calls me to apologize for what he posted and find out that he's posted subliminal messages about the whole 'problem' on social media. He's since removed it but says he stands by what he says.

So six years ago we had this student that I’ll call John. This boy was to be completely honest one of the most brilliant people I’ve ever met. I wholeheartedly believe if he had chosen a different path in life he would have been valedictorian. But John just loved doing bad shit. Smoking in the bathroom, showing up to school baked, calling teachers ungodly names, fist fighting, you name he probably did it. 

But honestly John wasn’t a bad kid. His family was judged extremely harshly, all of them felons, each parent in and out of jail. So he was treated like white trash by students and teachers alike. It’s understandable why he would act the way he would.

So it was half way through Johns tenth grade year when the superintendents son told John that he had been “fucking his crackwhore mom all night long”. John was 5’ 10” and 140 pounds soaking wet at 16 years old. Despite that I have genuinely never seen a worse beat down in my life. It took less than an hour for me to get a call from the super telling me to get rid of him.

I went along with it at the time not paying much thought to it. John was sent to the neighborhood reform school and from there to juvenile detention. Somewhere along the way he graduated high school early and joined the army. He’s still a very active part of the community while on leave and I actually introduced him to a school assembly where he spoke of how he turned his life around. I thought at the time that my part in his life had been what had straightened him up. I noticed he was short with me before and after his speech but thought nothing of it, figuring he was a man of few words.

Yesterday I saw him eating lunch with an old teacher of his that I remember him being particularly close to. I went up to them asking if I could join and then John pulled me aside.

He gave me a speech about how I was a key piece in what was ultimately some pretty messed up experiences in his life. I don’t remember too much of it except the words “The way you guys did me may have been standard, but it wasn’t right.

Me and this girl I didn't know well started a roasting session on the bus ride home from school.

It was all fun and games, we weren't saying anything offensive until she called me a stick bug. I'm a tall skinny person so it made sense, it even made me laugh but my logic was ""if she can make fun of my body I can make fun of hers"" 

I then proceeded to say she's built like a minivan and almost immediately she starts crying. I apologise and try to get her to stop crying but it's too late. All of her friends were yelling at me and calling me a body shamer 

The next day at school I got a 1 day iss (in school suspension) for and I quote ""making fun of someone's body...

16887,Not the A-hole,"

Some background: My grandfather just passed away at the end of January. He was closing in on 90 and lived a very full life and died very peacefully in his home which is exactly where he wanted to be. 

This is where the story gets very sticky, my grandfather lived in a cheap tract house and was very frugal. His only passions in life were woodworking and his garden. But to my huge surprised I was named as his sole heir with life changing money. With the house, everything in it and cash his estate was valued at a little over a million dollars. 

Here's where it gets even stickier. My mom passed away 6 years ago. She had one sister who I was fairly close to and from her I have 3 cousins. I don't know the full details of why my aunt was estranged from my grandpa, in fact all my mom ever told me was ""it's between the two of them."" I have mixed relationship with my cousins and because their mom was estranged from my grandpa, they never had a nice word to say about him and I don't know if they ever met him. To be fair, they probably never had the chance to get to know him like I did. Cousins and aunt did not attend the very small funeral I set up for my grandpa either. 


Now she and my cousins have been basically calling me nonstop somewhere between begging me and demanding of me that I split the estate 5 ways. 

This is what both of my attorneys have essentially advised:
No matter what I shouldn't split the estate 5 ways. If I do decide to be incredibly generous, it should be split 50/50 and my aunt and cousins can divide their half however they like. Both attorneys have advised against this period, as it's not in my best interest. 

I can write 4 $5000 checks out of the estate to get them to go away. $5000 in our state's probate system is generally seen as ""enough"" of an inheritance to be essentially be uncontestable and my aunt and cousins will have no further claim on my grandpas estate, or none that a judge would be willing to hear. The first attorney strongly advised I do this. 

I do nothing. I am carrying out my grandpa's wishes to the letter and that is my responsibility and also my benefit for staying close to him in his lifetime. This is my second attorney's preferred course of action. 

But this is not about the legality of the situation. This is about what SHOULD I do and would I be the asshole if I keep the entire estate for myself. Just over a million dollars is enough money for me to finally fund a retirement account, have a down payment on a decent house and actually save some money. I have no designs on a big blow out but maybe updating my car would be nice. I could do all of that with $500k, but that number sure looks different that $1 million.

7602,Not the A-hole,"Hello! I'm going to try and keep this simple and short. So here goes.My boyfriend (21) and I (20) are good together but we often argue about money. I by no means, make a lot of money. I have just worked since I was 15 and saved all my money since I was on disposable income (living at home) and have a fairly nice savings account that I don't touch. Well, my boyfriend was incredibly depressed for a year and didn't work at all. No income whatsoever and would sometimes have me help him out financially. He always paid me back in one way or another but it was definitely draining (emotionally and financially). Skip to now and he has a GREAT paying job, makes a good amount of money, way more than me and has more hours he can work (I'm in school, he is not). Whenever I'm getting close to the end of a pay period and I don't have much money left, or can't afford something, or ask if he minds chipping in, he often throws my savings in my face saying that I have way more money than he does total. Which is true, but I don't touch my savings and otherwise live paycheck to paycheck.  


I was talking to my older sister about this and how him doing that bothers me and she was somewhat empathetic. Eventually she asked me how much I had saved up and she went off on me about how I have no right to say I'm broke and my boyfriend is in the right and she never wants to hear me say I'm too broke for something or to do something because some people actually have to live paycheck to paycheck with no savings and not everyone had the financial guidance I did as a kid. I'm not sure where she got that from since we grew up together (She's only two years older). And how I'm above for having saved my money from working when I was 15. To be clear, my entire savings is money that I earned from when I was 15-18 up until I moved out. It has not grown or diminished as I do live paycheck to paycheck from bills having moved out. It's admittedly nice to have that fall back and I know not everyone is able to have or do that, but I worked for it.  


My sister is very well capable of having a savings account as she inherited a home from when our uncle passed and didn't go to college but rather a trade. Basically, she makes more money than me as I'm in college and pays very very low rent for the home since it's through family.

9144,Asshole,"This happened a couple weeks ago.  A big group of us were staying on a lake.  A woman who I had never met before was wearing her wedding ring while she was swimming/playing around.  At one point it fell off her hand and fell into shallow water.  A bunch of us ended up spending alot of time trying to find their ring including using snorkel gear and some old cheap metal detector but never found it.

I suggested to the couple to go out, rent a nice water proof metal detector, and do some searching.  Instead the husband pretty much gave up and put very little effort into looking for it.  He didn't go out and get a metal detector and he only looked for about an hour.  It was frustrating to see so little effort put forth into looking for a 6k ring that had alot of sentimental value.

The following week I rented a very nice metal detector for 45$ and a digging set and drove back to the lake (4 hours away).  After 2 hours BOOM I found the ring.  I was planning on going to a Jeweler / police and asking them to see if the ring had been lost or reported stolen.  Since I know neither one of these will popup since the couple know they lost it in a lake I was going to cash in afterwards.

Question is, now what?  I may have just met the couple but I know who they are and could return it to them.

She began to open up that she had some sort of medical condition and because of meds she's put on a lot of weight, like she's around 250 if I had to guess and maybe 5'7. I was having a good time but I just was not feeling it because of her weight and if she had been truthful with me from the start I never would have agreed to a date. About 1 hour in I make up an excuse of having to go to my buddies bday party and needed to leave. We split the cheque and it was kind of abrupt and I think she knew why I ended the night short. I gave her a hug and told her to have a great rest of the night and run off into the darkness. 

I instead meet up with one of my friends at her place and she wants to know the deets of the date and when I tell her everything she calls me a huge douche, an asshat, and an ass clown (laughed at that one). She said that how I was vibing with this girl and after she opened up to me I crushed her and thats what makes me an ass.

10594,Asshole,"This happened 2 days ago but I couldn’t post until now. 

I was in the meat section and you know how you queue and the meat person kind of calls you in the order you arrived. 

I arrived first. I had a large cart with me. The meat guy was busy. I left my cart there to go grab some crackers in a nearby aisle and I made a motion to the meat man that I would be right back. He gave me a understanding nod. 

I was gone for about 1 minute. When I came back, an old man of about 70 was standing there. The meat man finally finished the customer he had originally been serving and then he looked at me and asked how he could help

The old man yelled and said I was here first. He just got here. The meat man tried to explain that I had just stepped away but the man wasn’t having it. The man began yelling at me for being a line cutter etc. I just decided I didn’t want a confrontation and I ignored him and started ordering my meat. The man got in my face but I only see him in my peripheral vision, I am still not looking. Finally I had enough and I stepped directly in front of him and kind of bumped him back so he wouldn’t bother the meat man. He kept yelling and I bumped him again while my order was being processed. 

Finally my order was done and I got my meat. The man was still mumbling so while I was leaving I hit his cart with my cart hard so it knocked it about 5 inches and walked away. He kept yelling as I left. AITA for this?

14751,Not the A-hole,"I have stage four cancer and receive chemo every Monday. During these sessions my doctor pops by to chat about symptoms and we can discuss treatment plans and such. These visits are always held in an open room with other patients sitting next to you and nurses drawing blood at the same time. 

The past few weeks I’ve been experiencing some rather annoying (TMI) symptoms and radiotherapy was put on the table as a possibility. All I know about radiotherapy I had learned from my own research, and was a bit overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information. I mentioned that I wasn’t sold on going through with it on top of my chemotherapy as I’m already pretty wiped out and don’t see much benefit. 

I had a visit with another doctor on my team who really stressed that radiotherapy seemed the best option. After this, I spoke with my nurse about it and decided I would like more information before deciding. 

My main-doctor is a very busy woman, I get that, and these weekly visits are normally very short just to make sure I’m healthy enough to get the go-ahead for treatment. Last week we had planned she would stop by for a bit longer than the usual 5-10 minutes so that we could discuss radiotherapy more in-depth, and she could outline her exact plans. When she came in I had a notepad full of questions and I was ready and prepared. When I brought it up she said it wasn’t on the table anymore and we shouldn’t worry about it. I mentioned a few things my nurse had said regarding the treatment and she immediately shoots those down, claiming the nurse was ‘completely wrong’ and ‘didn’t know what she was talking about’. 

To me this felt rather rude, and probably could have been handled better. 

This morning she popped in again and I stressed my symptoms were starting to affect my mental health. I was just asking if there was anything we could do to help. She brought up radiotherapy as a possibility...I was pretty mad at this point, as she told me previously it was off the table. So I brought up some of the questions I had before and was constantly met with, “we’ll discuss that when it comes to it,” or something of the sort. 

I then reminded her I wasn’t sold on radiotherapy as a whole, and that I wanted all the information before making a decision to go forward. I do not want to be bombarded right before with information and feel overwhelmed. (Which has happened a couple times in the past). She got a kind of annoyed look and started just going into auto-pilot and started describing the process of radiotherapy and when I would ask questions she would interrupt me and say she’ll get to it. 

I asked her to leave as I was just too frustrated to listen.

I asked her if she wanted painkillers and when she is getting up, she said she didnt and isnt.

For everyone to understand I'll give some context, it's kinda long but its important to understand why I say no. 

In my family theres mum, my older brother, me and my younger brother. I'm 18 but since my baby brother was born when I was 13 I've been taking care of him mostly. It was around that time that I realised how sexist and racist my family is. I wont go into too much detail but I hit rock bottom in 2016 and literally had to leave for a week and a half others I would've killed myself. I picked myself up after thanks to my amazing best friend and the world of books. Now I hold resentment against my family for this. The day since I turned 18 I got a job at my bros workplace which is a bar/restaurant (you need to be 18 to work there) and it was good I make on average £160 every two weeks working two days a week, I would be making more but I have to take care of my baby brother

Recently theres been drama in the kitchen with the dickhead assistant kitchen manager R and my bro who works as basically a chef. My mums now saying leave the job at this point and I've said dont go until you have another job lined up as a safety net because it can be hard to get a job sometimes. 

Onto the AITA part. Now my mum said today if my brother is fired or quits today I have to quit as well. Let me say this my workplace has treated me so well, and I appreciate them so much my coworkers are great and everything. And if I wanted more hours my floor manager would be more than happy to give them. When I said ""no why would I, they've treated me extremely well"" she went OFF and started saying I dont support my brother how I'm a fucking idiot and all. Literally says ""hes the man of the house if you find a man he has to get your bros approval how are you gonna sleep knowing you're betraying him"" like WTF IS UP WITH THAT. and funny enough this isnt even the tip of her sexism.

13855,Not the A-hole,"My daughter is 16 and has a job at a chain coffeeshop. She works with 6 other highschoolers and 5 college kids. The high schoolers she works with don't like their manager, he keeps their hours just below the threshold for higher pay, doesn't give promised raises, and is just an asshole to work with.

Recently my daughter and one of her friends were joking about making a union like the ones they were studying at school. They texted some of the other kids from work, and the idea started gaining traction. So I talked with them about it, explaining the possible benefits and risks. I tried to encourage them to do their own research too. I thought it was pretty cool that they were considering taking something they're learning about in history class and applying it.

The girls ended up inviting the other high school kids who worked at the coffee shop to our house, to talk about how to unionize. I could tell some kids were going along for fun. But most of them were taking it seriously. I helped them write out their demands and practice them. They even got the college kids, who were unhappy with scheduling around exams, on board. 

They all went to the coffeeshop Sunday morning, and presented their case to the boss. Who absolutely blew up on them, and told them that if they didn't stick to their schedule, they were all fired. But the kids stood their ground. He started singing out the kids that were scheduled to work that morning and telling them to start work immediately or they're fired. And so three of them got fired. Then he told the rest that anyone else who didn't report for their shifts would be fired too, and I don't think he expected them to call his bluff. He fired several more, then started demanding that the ""fired"" kids come in to work. Right now, the kids are all holding strong. Apparently the manager is trying to replace everyone fast, but isn't having much luck. 

I'm honestly quite proud of my daughter for all this. But the parents of the other high school kids aren't all OK with this. Several of them have called me up or come to speak to me furious with me for these reasons:
- Making their kid lose their job, which they were supposed to keep to teach them hard work and responsibility
- Encouraging kids to be entitled brats and sabatoge a local business owner
- Letting the kids play at something they didn't really understand

I told them that the kids made their choice, all I did was give them a place to talk and plan things. I got a call from the coffeeshop owner too, to say that my daughter hasn't been covering her shifts. And that the kids are ""playing"" at a union. I told him that it doesn't sound like play to me, perhaps he should listen to what they have to say. And he got furious with me, calling my daughter lazy.

7504,Everyone Sucks,"  

I live with 2 guys my age in a 3 BR 2 BA apartment. I was friends with one (P) before we moved out here and the other was a friend of P (T). Before agreeing to live together I talked with P and he said they were pretty clean.

After 2 weeks I realize we have VERY different standards for cleanliness. I not a neat-freak but good lord they were gross. At first cleaned up after them, but once it became routine I spoke up and told them to clean up their own messes. They never did and I was left cleaning.

On Thursday I come home and go to the bathroom, but the toilet was to the brim with murky brown water and big doodoo chunks. We have 2 bathrooms. P uses one and T and I use the other. I come out and theyre watching TV. I asked “Who fucked the toilet?” knowing full well it was T. Neither of them say anything. “T I know it was you, can you go clean it up? Its nasty and I need to go” T says “Are you serious?” I respond “What? Its your mess.” He goes “Are you really shit-shaming me? Everyone is fucking ashamed of when they take a shit. Yeah ok I clogged the toilet. MY. BAD. That doesnt give you any right to go and talk about me shitting to the whole world”

Im lost and answer “Ok… but are you going to clean up the toilet or…?” T says “Dont know how” Even more lost I ask “Dont know how to clean or dont know how to use a plunger?” He yells “Dude not everyone is a fucking mechanical engineer and knows how everything works” I answered “You dont need to be a M.E. to push your shit down a tube” At this point P joins in and says “If you care so much why dont you just clean it up?” I answer “There’s no way Im cleaning up someone elses turds, this is on T”

Come Saturday the toilet is still clogged. Im refusing to cave because Ive been caving and cleaning their messes ever since we moved in. No chance I let them win this round. I decide to teach T a lesson and show him that his messes arent going to just “go away” by literally shaming him with his own shit. While they were out Saturday night I rigged the bathroom. I aimed an IR sensor at the door and mounted a servo to the back of the toilet with a cable snaking into the well and tied to the water feed plunger so that when T opened the bathroom door the servo would pull on the cable, open the plunger and allow water to feed into the bowl which, already completely full, would overflow onto the floor covering his feet in his own soggy, neglected shit.

That night T brought a girl home from the bar. I didnt know this until I heard the scream. She was the first one to go into the bathroom and tripped the trap. T came running out and I could hear him completely panicking. The girl grabbed her stuff and took off. I came out and T was still freaking out and I said “Shoulda just cleaned it up” And then went back into my room.

T cleaned up the mess and it reeks in the apartment but they didnt know I had anything to do with what happened. So Reddit AITA for “shit-shaming” my roommate?",233,1267,0.95,AITA for “shit-shaming” my roommate?,cji8lk,2019-07-29 22:06:18,ESH,2966,AITA

I was put on furlough. My boyfriends job is classed as essential. We do not live together. Bf has been working 6 days a week with some shifts being around 12 hours.

He tells me how tired he is from working and the general frustrations of not being able to visit me, as well as not being able to play games in his spare time which is his favourite past time. He sends me texts apologising, saying how much of a shit boyfriend he feels that he's so tired and he feels he's failing to provide me with what is expected of him as boyfriend. 

I felt really bad for him. He knows how proud I am of him for working hard - I wrote a sickly sweet Facebook message expressing how proud I was. I've also made him personalised cards, printed off pictures to send him, sent him deliveries of his favourite chocolate and sweets to try and cheer him up. I've also been a lot more cooperative in the idea of sending him intimate videos and trying to maintain a healthy sex life through face time and filming myself, which I was always never too keen on doing as I consider myself to have quite low self esteem.

I thought I would treat him and bought him a switch as I know how depressed he feels lately. It is a secret.

I texted his mum and gave her a heads up something expensive would be delivered for him. We got talking about what I had bought him and I said it was a surprise for working so hard. 

His mum replies back to me saying that my boyfriend has been made redundant 8 weeks ago and isn't working anymore. 

When I confronted my boyfriend about him lying to me all these weeks he starts to cry and says he felt too ashamed to explain to me after I was so proud of him for working and he was also enjoying the fact that I was getting more comfortable sending him videos of myself and he didn't want it to stop. He said he was planning on telling me soon and he was just isolating before he surprise visited me. 

I want to return the present as I feel like he doesn't deserve it any more. It is expensive and I feel like the gesture has been lost/ruined now. I am obviously saddened that he has been made redundant, and I would have been completely understanding if he had told me at the time. 

I texted his mum and said that when the package arrives please can you let me know and I will collect it to pick it up and return it She refused and said that her son will be getting the present regardless. I explained how I am on furlough pay so money is quite tight atm, to which she said 'I should have thought about that sooner'.

1705,Asshole," 

My daughter Emily and her boyfriend Justin have been dating for about 8 months now. They’ve gotten along pretty well and he’s a nice young man.(they’re both 17 and seniors in high school) My daughter is in the school drama program and she had a play on Saturday. She wanted Justin to come and watch her with us and he obliged. So Justin is a pretty introverted person. Justin’s family is Korean-American and his parents first language isn’t English.(though Justin has been in the U.S. since he was 3 and his first language is English) On top of that Justin’s friends aren’t Emily’s friends and vice versa. Because of those factors he’s not really known among my friends and Emily’s friend’s parents. At the play me, my husband, and Justin were waiting in line to be seated and we come across friends.

We say hi and Lily we get asked who Justin is. I introduce Justin as Justin, Emily’s friend. Then there was a passing mention of Emily’s ex Benjamin. I didn’t know it was important at that time, but one of my friends Lily mentioned Benjamin as Emily’s former boyfriend. Justin didn’t say anything, we watched the play, it was great and we all went back home. An hour after we got home my daughter told me that Justin wanted to ask me about something. He asked why I introduced him to my friends as just a friend instead of boyfriend or he’s dating Emily. He said it would be fine for me to introduce him as a friend, but my friends know Benjamin as Emily’s former boyfriend and they dated for barley a month. He and Emily have been dating for 8 months, but gets introduced as just a friend while Benjamin is known as a former boyfriend.

I was flustered(because I wasn’t expecting the question) and I told him that it was because Benjamin and his parents are well known and connected with my friends and him and his family are not. So it was just more natural for my friends to know Benjamin as a former boyfriend and Justin(who my friends just met) as just a friend. Justin was not happy with what I told him and told me that he feels the connection explanation is a veiled shot at him being Asian instead of white. He also feels humiliated like he’s not good enough to be Emily’s boyfriend and that’s why my husband and I merely introduce him as a friend. I told him to stop being so ridiculous and that I’d introduce him next time as Emily’s boyfriend if he really wants. He abruptly left our house and even had the gall to say he felt disrespected as he was leaving. My husband is on my side, but Emily is furious at us and saying Justin has every right to be angry.

2608,Not the A-hole,"Our sitter keeps letting our puppy out of his crate and doesn’t supervise him. He has accidents and then she doesn’t clean them up. 

Three years ago when I (36f) went back to work after having kids we were looking for a sitter to come to our house to watch our kids. We had recently had to put our dog down and mentioned to everyone we interviewed that we would eventually be getting a dog again, but not for a few years because our hands were already full with two young kids. 

When we mentioned this to the woman (she’s 58 now) we eventually hired she went on about how much she loved dogs, had one herself and didn’t think a home was complete without one. Great!

We’d been open about our timeline in getting a dog because our kids had been begging for one, and we were open with our kids that we would be getting one this last summer, but not before. Our sitter would take the kids to her house sometimes to visit with her dog and she would talk to the kids about her dog too. 

Fast forward to this spring when we started looking for a dog. We told her and she responded very strongly that she would not be looking after a dog. Her job was to look after the kids alone. 

We agreed that she wouldn’t look after the dog, that the dog would be crated while she was at the house and we would hire a dog walker. She agrees to this, especially as both kids would be at school all day and she would only be helping with care after school. 

But quickly after the dog arrives she starts letting him out of his crate unsupervised. He’s still a puppy and has accidents. She does not clean up these accidents and leaves them for us. 

The breaking point came two days ago when the dog pooped in the living room and then she stepped in it and tracked poop everywhere. She told us about the accident but not the extent of it. It was a literal bleep show in our living room and took forever to clean up. 

We sent her an email that night saying that we didn’t expect her to walk, train or house break the dog but if the dog has an accident while she’s there and is out of the crate, could she please do a quick minimal clean (eg: sop up the pee or remove the “bulk” of the poop) of the mess and let us know so we can scrub/mop later. 

Her response was that she didn’t agree to us getting the dog in the first place and her job was to look after THE KIDS ALONE (emphasis her’s). She was very short and snippy with my husband and I in person. We sent her an email saying that to accommodate her the puppy can stay in his crate, but if she lets him out we need her to do the minimal clean up if he has an accident while she’s on duty. 

Her response has been to threaten to quit. 

My kids love this sitter and they love their dog, which they’ve had for four months now. AITA for asking her to clean up the mess the dog makes when she lets him out of his crate unsupervised?

EDIT: We have a dog walker that comes twice a day for exercise sessions. Either my husband and I do the morning walk. The dog is not crated when we get home at 5. At 6:30 we go for a family walk. On days where he seems a bit pent up one of us will take him to throw the ball around once the kids are asleep.

In fact we've been friends most of our life but things went to shit in our relationship when she choose to side with her cousin (not my family) over me and my wife for a disagreement over business services.

My wife hired my cousin's cousin (a decorator) company based on her recommendation. My wife does event planning and needs to have good reliable contractors.

Immediately, this woman provided horrible service. Not showing up to a site visit without any explanation, over promising and not remembering what she promised, holding back on giving estimates or quotes.

My wife was stressed dealing with her and wanted to fire her but I told her just stick it out and I'll try to get my cousin to talk to her.

My cousin did but apparently it went the other way, all her cousin did was bitch about my wife and how controlling and anal she was.

I explained to my cousin the truth, even sent her screen shots of unanswered emaild, calls, texts, some outright lies etc.

At the day off the event the decorating she was supposed to be doing was so plain, and not what she agreed with my wife, but my wife kept it in and actually went and got more decorative stuff borrowed for the event. In the end, my wife and her worker did a really nice job.

Later during the event, the 'decorator' came in with my cousin and was taking food, free drinks and then taking pics of the decor (to probably use in her future portfolio). This pissed my wife off immensely as she was tired and frustrated, she told the decorator that she wasn't a guest at this event and that she needs to leave. She told her she'll return all her materials tomorrow, but will sue her if she uses it in her portfolio.

This angered her so much that she began to take down get decor during the event and caused scene. Security eventually escorted her out.

My wife returned the materials the next day but later in the week was hit with an invoice for her remaining 50% fee. My wife refused to pay and that's when my cousin got involved, calling her all sorts of names, spreading rumours about her, leaving bad reviews of her business online.

My wife took them to court and won.

Now I've not spoken to her since. As far as I see it, she chose one cousin's side over another and I will not forgive her for that especially given how wrong they were.

She tried to freeload of my wife and use her. I haven't forgiven my cousin for so quickly siding with her too.

She doesn’t have a holster for it or anything, just tosses it in her purse, which seems stupid, but whatever that’s her business. So when she comes to visit we ask her to leave the gun in her car because we have two young kids (an infant and a toddler). Well one day she shows up with a purse that has a pocket with a gun holster in it that zips up and then can be locked. I’m like, “That’s nice, you still have to leave your gun in the car when you visit.” Well one day she asks me to put something in her purse and when I do I see the gun sitting in the pocket, which is unzipped. Mind you the gun is loaded and my two year old who loves getting into anything and everything is running around. So I flipped out on her. Basically about how we’ve discussed this multiple times, she doesn’t take gun safety seriously, and from now on we’re searching her purse before she enters the house and the gun either needs to immediately go in our locked gun safe or in her car when she arrives. She acted like a scolded teenager who doesn’t understand why what they did was wrong, like I’m totally overreacting. Honestly, I want to tell her she cannot come visit unless she leaves the gun at home, but I know that will really upset her.

14129,Not the A-hole,"First, background info.

My parking spot is challenging on its own. My parking lot is in the back of my building and each spot is long enough for two cars. The first few spots of the lot are on a decline towards the building (meaning the part of the car closer to the alley is higher than the part of the car closest to the building). To make things worse my spot is the very first one and is next to the sidewalk, which is level to the alleyway. My spot has a giant manhole at the end right by the alley and sidewalk. This manhole is so messed up if you aren’t careful going over it you bottom out. Finally, and important to note, there is an entire parking lot on the other side of the alley that is empty and does not tow.

Next door to my building is another apartment building; however, this one does not have any parking spots allocated to it. In the past couple weeks there has been this same car that parks off the side of the alleyway blocking my spot. Earlier this week as I was leaving for work and she was blocking my spot. She didn’t move until I shot her a look.

So today, I was on my way back from work. Full disclosure, I was in a bad mood because school, work and life exist. And, I had accidentally slammed my entire hand in the car door while leaving work about 15 minutes prior. I get to the lot and SHE WAS BLOCKING MY SPOT AGAIN. I had to come in from the other side and finesse my way into the spot like I’ve never had to before. Took me an extra 5 minutes, and I only had one good hand at the moment.

So, then I see her come out of the building next to mine (as the door is literally RIGHT NEXT to my car). So, I get out of the car and I just look at her and I say, ""Not to be a dick, but do you think you could stop parking your car there. We both know this isn't the first time you've been in my way and that's NOT a parking spot. There is quite literally an entire EMPTY lot right beside where you are parked and you chose to BLOCK me so that you were, what? 5 feet closer to the door? Do you think you could maybe not? I'd hate to be forced to have your car towed"". (And yes, that is almost exactly what I said and I have an attitude when I'm in a good mood so I'm sure it came out assertive and sassy) She looked shocked/scared and let out a meek, ""okay"". I rolled my eyes and just walked away.

Now I'm not a stranger to lecturing people who deserve it, but this is the first time I've ever just snapped on a stranger. I'm afraid of turning into a bitter old ""can I speak to the manager"" lady. Not that it's really that extreme.

16982,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR at the bottom. 

I am going to start this by saying since my dad died she ""forgets"" stuff all the time. My dad has been gone 6 years now. I've begged for her to go to see her Dr but she refuses.

I live an hour from my mum and I think because of this there is a lot of out of sight out of mind. 

In the weeks leading up to my Daughter's birthday everytime we spoke I would remind her that it was M's birthday on the 27th. She'd tell me she knew as it was on her calendar, that she wouldn't forget.

On her birthday nothing comes through the post. Mum actually called me on the evening. I figured she'd called to wish M happy birthday but she had called to rant about how my sister had lied to her. (my younger sister is going through a very hard time as her 8yr old daughter has incurable cancer but she still managed to wish my daughter a happy  birthday!). I eventually managed to say ""that M has had a good day today and we've just got back from tea"" which is responded with ""oh, that's nice.. I have to go now"" and before I had chance to say about her birthday, she hung up. 

Anyway, I get a phone call the next day saying she's going to post M's cards out so she can get them by the next Tuesday (This was 3 days after her birthday)
I asked her why she never asked to speak to M when I spoke to her yesterday She then starts telling me it's my fault I never said anything, That I should have put her on the phone. I would have, had I been given the chance. I kept calm and explained why I was disappointed all the while she was screaming at me. Screaming it was my fault, that she can't help being forgetful then she hangs up then refuses to answer the phone. 

I send her a message saying I wouldn't apologize for standing up for my children. All she was bothered about is that this whole situation was my fault and to not speak to her ever again because she's my mother and I shouldn't speak to her like that. 

Tuesday comes and goes and the card arrives. I give M the phone and she calls my mum. She says thank you and has a small conversation with her. When M had finished she asked my mum if she wanted to talk to me and I heard her say no and hung up. 

A month goes by and I hear nothing. One day she rings and I answer. She tries brushing the whole thing under the carpet by calling me a liar. She tells me she sent the cards out before my daughter's birthday. I sent her screen grabs of our conversation with the date stamp above showing the day after but she calls me a liar, says that I changed the date on the messages etc. She then tells me I am trying to kill her and that I won't be happy till she's dead. That couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth.

TL;DR : I reminded my mum that it was nearly my daughter's birthday, she forgot. She blames me. Calls me a liar when I show her proof. Tells me I won't be happy till she is dead and in a box.

I know it's a cliche and a shit excuse, but I had a very rough childhood and I started doing drugs at 14. By the time I was 19, I was addicted to heroin. Between 19 and 23, I overdosed 3 times, once on purpose. I tried to quit several times, and my longest sober period lasted for about 2 years, from 23 to 25. That's when I relapsed ONCE (meaning, I did heroin just one time and stopped again).

I'm currently 1.5 years sober and I'm feeling much much better, I'm in therapy that actually works for me for the first time in my life, I take medication, and I have my shit together - I'm healthy, I have a nice job, a nice place and a nice boyfriend.

The reason I haven't told him yet is plain and simple because I'm afraid he'd leave me. My record is frankly horrible! 10 years of drug addiction, several ODs, multiple relapses... Hell, I'd leave myself! Except I really really **really** think I'm going to stay sober. I'm 99.99% certain of it.

Technology isn't really my passion so, naturally, I am a grandmother when it comes to using my computer. I know, even I don't know how I ended up in the tech industry. Anyways, I was going to start work on an assignment and had a very, very dumb question that I myself felt embarrassed for asking. But, him being my bf for 3 years now, I know I can ask him anything without feeling embarrassed. So, I go ahead and say ""Can I ask you a dumb question?"" he says ""ya?"" I ask my question and he immediately gives me a look like ""did you just ask me if the Earth is flat?"" and goes on to explain the answer to the question in the most condescending and arrogant way possible.

Naturally, I got upset and explained to him that he should not speak to me like that when I'm asking a question to learn something. Like, better late than never right? Sure, it may have been the dumbest possible question I could have asked given that my career is in tech, but if I somehow don't know it, I don't know it; acknowledge that I'm still a student, still learning, and there's more I don't know than I do know.

So then he comes in and apologizes to me saying it was wrong of him to speak to me harshly. That's great, but I don't want to accept his apology because he believes I should not let his ""joking personality"" get to me so much since we've been together so long.

She is already an awesome aunt to my small daughter. The problem is that she NEVER stops mentioning that she's ""trying."" It has come up at every dinner, in every casual conversation, and in every context for three months and she's driving me batty. She talks about it anytime someone even mentions alcohol or a trip that would involve strenuous activity. For example, ""Oh, I wish I could have wine too, but you might as well drink it. It can't be in the fridge since *we're trying,* you know?"" I haven't said anything yet, but I might snap.

It's not just that she talks about it, either. She also already assumes that she is having trouble trying to conceive. She has, on several occasions, exaggerated the amount of time they've been trying to conceive. They started in maybe mid-February (I specifically remember because of some insurance stuff she had to work out first) and she claimed a few weeks ago that they've been trying for four months. That's literally not mathematically possible. She has also brought up  - more than once - that I had ""no trouble"" getting pregnant, since my daughter was unplanned (conceived just days after stopping hormonal birth control, and while using backup methods). She went so far once to accuse me of ""having it easy"" when she knows for a fact that I would rather have had a harder time, since I was not even trying. She makes me feel as though she is mad at me for getting pregnant so easily when, really, nothing she is experiencing is concerning. This is also the same person who told me, when I told her about the doctor's appointments, blood work, and minimal testing associated with my pregnancy, that she would not allow doctors to do those things to her, and she would just find a way around the mandatory testing. 

The average woman is told to try for at least a year before she seeks further help to conceive, even longer if she is younger than 35. Most doctors say it can take up to that long for your body to adjust after coming off of hormonal birth control, which she didn't do until they had everything else worked out - early to mid-February. 

I also have friends who have struggled - hard - with infertility. Miscarriages, multiple rounds of IVF, the works. I am angry for them every time she complains about how long it has been. One friend gave up after 9 years of trying, and another successfully had two children after multiple rounds of IVF and over 10 years of treatments.

Well the latest is everyone setting up weekends they'll host some kind of Game of Thrones watch party. A bunch of us were at dinner figuring out who would take which weekend. I spoke up to say that we would happily put in money for anyone's weekend to cover cost of drinks or snacks.

The next day I got a message from one of the other women in the group asking me why we didn't host one. I said that I don't even watch the show, so it would be weird, and that everyone else seemed to have it covered. She asked me why I don't watch the show and kept saying ""You are the ONLY human being alive not into GOT. I promise.""

She said she's always thought it was weird that I didn't join in that stuff. I told her that I don't like that kind of stuff, but that I'm there for board game nights or bar trivia, that a bunch of us did a half marathon last spring, some of us have gone to concerts together, etc. 

This wasn't good enough though, and she said this: It's not really about what you have done but what you haven't. GOT ending is a huge deal, and to have someone in our group dis us and the show is hurtful. I really think you should come, you'll probably get into the show, just stop thinking you're not like the other girls because you don't like ""geeky"" things.

I was taken aback by this and have sat with it for a few days, not responding to her. For the record, I don't think I'm not like any other girl, there are millions of women just like me. I just don't enjoy that tv show. There are plenty of tv shows I do like. 

After sharing the convo with my husband, he told me that there was nothing wrong with me not wanting to go or host a party for a show I don't even like. But apparently that conversation got around to other people, because a few of the other members (all women, actually) told me I was being a snob and one of them went as far as to mock me for liking pop music and thinking I was ""too good"" for them. Which is not true!!

16606,Asshole,"So this literally just happened 5mins ago as I type this. I just sold a car to a person amd they brought a trailer to bring it back. They had a 2hr trip each way and were in a hurry to get home as it ia very cold today and we have about half a foot of snow on the ground, which makes everyrhinf worse. First I had a who're of a time tryinf to get the car unfrozen as it has sat for a year. So after an hr I get it unstuck and head inside to wait for them. Well they show up 15 mins later and begin doing their thing while i get the title ready. Well they have the car half way on the trailer when this elderly couple shows up in there car trying to get by. Well I live on what can best be described as a goat.path. it is barely wide enough for 3 cars and the people buying the car had a 2500 Chevy Silverado or some shit like that with a trailer behind it so no one was squeezing by. Well the elderly couple aita there for a few minutes and the husband finally gets out and says can we speed it up. Well we were trying but you want to make sure.that care is strapped down or some bad shit will happen. Then his wife starts honking on the horn and doesn't let up and the husband says you can just pull forward and we can squeeze by. But since the car wasnt strapped down that wasnt possible and we explained that and he got mad. I guess he knew my grandfather because he threw his name out there saying this isn't the (insert my last name) I kbow. Which is funny because my grandfather would have told him to fuck off way quicker than I did. Which I told him while i told him to fuck off. It is really annoying how that generation calls my generation entitled when he couldnt be bothered to wait literally 10mins to strap a car down properly to avoid injury and possible someone's death if that car came loose. 


Edit: so people think I just blocked the road and tokd them to fuck off....not true...they pulled up and rolled rhe window down...I waved and the guy buying the car said sorry be done in about 10...the driver then proceeds to get out and walk over to the buyer and pretty much stand over his shoulder...at this point his wife lays on the horn as he mutters Shit. That is when I call him an asshole as he gets in the car and proceeds to say that my grandfather would never have done this...when I've seen him do much worse...that dude was a huge prick..different story tho...but anyway they turn around and head out the other way which is 5 mins longer to their destination ...



Edit #2: people seem to think I was blocking the road for the fuck of it...the road is barely wide enough for 2 cars in most points. If there was another option we woukd have preferred it. But they couldn't pull in my drive as it is a hill and the top they could have pulled in but the trailer woukd be in the road and then the car wouldnt be able to pull up it as the trailer would be facing the wrong way. We having logging trucks that block the road and I and other people have waited patiently fir them to finish their thing and move w.e. needs moving. This road is constantly being blocked by people doing things like plowing their driveway or loading cars. So there is no way they haven't run into this problem before.

12667,Asshole,"Throwaway in case anyone recognizes our situation. 

My boyfriend and I of 3 years are finally moving in together. We live in a really, really expensive city where rent can be exorbitant. I currently live in a smaller flat with 3 roommates and my bf lives close to the city center in a small flat he bought 2 years ago. 

We’ve decided that we’ll look for a new, larger place that’s just “ours” and my bf will sell his flat or rent it out (he hasn’t decided yet.) 

So right now we’re looking around but we can’t decide on a budget. For one, he earns 7x what I do (45k vs. ~300k) and can afford so much more in rent. I want to look at larger places that are far out of my price range ($800-1000) but he could easily afford ($4000-5000) because these are the only ones that are close to both of our work and large enough to live in comfortably with two people. However, he wants to look at cheaper flats that A) are affordable to me and B) would allow him to pay roughly the same as me. 

We had a fight recently where I said I’d like to look at more expensive flats and he asked me how I’d afford my share (he thinks I should pay 35-40% of rent). I said I’d like to pay what I’m paying now ($750) and he could make up the rest. He got upset at me even though it would still be a smaller share of his income. I feel guilty to asking him to pay more but I feel upset that he’d rather live in a smaller, shittier flat just so I “pay my equal share” than spend more so we could both be comfortable. AITA for the suggestion?

**edit:** sorry I got the math wrong, he wants me to contribute 35-40% not 25-30%. So our budget would be $2200 a month if I contribute the same as before ($750). This cost is essentially nothing to him though but I feel like he’s sticking to it for the principle which makes me feel really shitty.",458,441,0.84,AITA for wanting to move somewhere I can’t afford but my bf can?,bohjh1,2019-05-14 11:12:38,YTA,1819,AITA

So, about my girlfriend, we have been together for 2 years. She doesn’t live with me, she stays over really often tho, so she has the house keys.

2 days ago, she came over without warning me. Me and my brother were asleep on couch, he wasn’t wearing a shirt because it was hot, and he was laying on top of me. She woke us up and made a scene in front of him. She said that our relationship was weird and disgusting and it’s extremely concerning that he’s so affectionate towards me. My brother was in tears and he even apologized to her. I brought him to his room and calmed him down. 

I went back to living room, she was sitting on couch, watching tv and acting like nothing happened. I told her to get the fuck out.

7072,Not the A-hole,"Here's a fun, low-stakes post for you guys regarding work potluck etiquette. So, nurses *love* potlucks. Especially night shift, which is what I work.

My brownies were famous at my old hospital. Some of my co-workers would throw fits if they weren't working when I brought them, so I'd have to stash a couple in their mailboxes. There were never any left over. I'm talking super fudgy, coffee-coconut-cayenne brownies with a layer of chocolate chip cookie underneath.

So I'm at a new hospital and we had a potluck for a coworker who's leaving. I brought my signature brownies, some people brought savory foods and some people brought store bought desserts. I noticed that the homemade stuff (cheese dip, mac n cheese, etc) was pretty bland/unseasoned. Not bad, just the stereotypical white person amount of seasoning (I am also white, before anyone gets worked up). A few people tried my brownies and seemed to like them, but most people seemed hesitant to try them once I mentioned what was in them. Nobody had food allergies, and I tried one and they turned out great.

By morning half of my brownies were still there, but all of the store bought cookies (several dozen) had been eaten. I considered leaving my precious brownies for day shift to enjoy, but I didn't want them to be thrown out if the day shift staff had similar taste preferences to night shift. So I took my beloved brownies home and will probably use them in homemade ice cream. I live by myself and will probably struggle to finish them all.

AITA for not giving my brownies to the next shift and keeping them for myself? The other homemade dishes were taken home but they were in crock-pots and perishable. My brownies were in a disposable pan and could've sat on the table all day without issue. Nobody said anything about it as I was leaving, I just felt kinda weird about it.

Her sister is younger than both her and I, being in her twenties. My in laws invited us to dinner on Sunday and my mother in law had prepared us a wonderful spread which we took part in finishing up preparing. 

My sister in law decided to make the salad, which she had mixed with her hands and fingers together. Usually I have absolutely no problem with hand prepared food as long as hands are washed. My MIL’s kitchen set up is one geared towards entertaining too so we were all helping out at our respective work stations when I noticed her long fake nails and the amount of dark brown crud beneath them.

She saw me looking and snapped that it was just fake tan, and I kinda laughed it off with her and carried on chopping my carrots to make it less awkward that she’d caught me looking. 

I discretely told my wife later on and she shrugged it off and said she didn’t mind- cool, I had done my part and warned her, and I do agree that we probably put all kinds of crap in our mouths without us knowing anyway.

I've had my reservations about the whole thing from the start seeing as they had only been dating for a month when he proposed. And there seem to be a lot of red flags with the guy. I tried to be supportive and help her plan it last summer (because weddings take a lot of fucking planning) but one thing or another got in the way. She's super scattered and flakey anyway so we just never made any solid plans. They didn't set a date until mid January. I happened to start a new job in January so I have 0 free time for anything now, especially when she lives an hour away and was my baby sitter (but stopped babysitting to plan her wedding) so now I also don't have a babysitter.

6105,Asshole,"When I walk my dog around the neighborhood I pick up his poop and carry the poop bag until I reach a trash can, either a permanent city trash can, like the one you might find at an intersection, or, if they are by the street, a wheeled trash can that is in front of someone's house. 

OK, I know I might get some hate for this but I have a couple things I feel justify my actions. 

The trash cans I'm talking about are provided by the city, printed on the receptacle in huge letters is ""PROPERTY OF CITY OF (MY CITY)"". The city does not charge you for the trash cans. They are a requirement of using the city's provided trash service (Which they do charge for). Trash pick up is once a week, and it is common in my neighborhood for people to just leave the trash cans outside in that strip between the sidewalk and the street all the time. 

I only ever put anything in these trash cans if they are on the street, or accessible from the sidewalk. I don't go onto private property or seek out the cans if they are not immediately visible.

I tie a knot in the poop bag to seal the poop inside and reduce odor. 

I'm not a hypocrite here, if I leave my trash cans outside and someone else puts their dogs poop in my can I don't care. I do however, store my trash cans in my rear of my property so they are not  visible or accessible from the sidewalk. 

My boyfriend thinks I'm the AH because it stinks up people's trash cans, and technically- it's illegal to dump trash in these cans without permission. My argument is that if people didn't want other people to put trash in their cans they would wheel them up their driveway away from the street. Plus I think the cans are kind of an eye sore.

I feel that when I am paying a premium for delivery service, it’s reasonable for me to expect them to deliver to my door since they are the ones who chose to be delivery drivers in a big city and that parking can sometimes be tricky.

I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I’ll give it to one of them. Or I’ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She’ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. 

Anyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I’ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. 

A few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. 

Last night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. 

While we were eating she brought it up again. She said “you said you give about $125 a month right babe?” I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says “I outran you this week!” I didn’t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. 

Long story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.

I instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. 

She’s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. 

Now I’m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn’t have given away that much when we can barely afford it.

Would it be overkill to inform their employer of this thing?

Our mother is very appearance conscious. She's been on every fad diet in the book and works out like a crazy person. I believe she has an eating disorder. Because of this, she's been very hard on my sister for the weight gain. After so many fights between the two of them, my mother has given up talking about it with my sister. This has made their relationship better, but now my mother has started turning to me for help. 

She will cry to me when I'm home saying that she thinks my sister will be diabetic and that she needs to lose 50 pounds to be happy and healthy. I mostly just ignore this and say its not my place to judge her or her health.

I try to plan activities that are fun and free because tight on funds. I do not talk about their mother or the realtionship with father and mother. Things were pretty good until my son was born.


 Since he was born the trouble began. Myah aged 10 when this started would come for visits with brother aged 6. When they would come over visit would be like usual nothing wrong, fun had by all. Then she would go home and tell her mom all kinds of lies about us.

 She would say i called her names and was mean. She also started saying her dad was abusive, cps ruled out any abuse on our end. Mother also calls calls local cops to report harrasment by me when i go out of my way to avoid that woman. The mother has always been a piece of work so i avoid her if possible. 


The last time i saw the kids i decided that would be the last time i visit with them. They came over for the weekend like normal. We went to a movie one night and then the park second day. Then they went home. As soon as she got home the phone rang. It was the mother. She is calling me names and threatening me. The reason you ask. 


Myah told her mom that i had hit her and brother. That i had ignored them all weekend. That i wouldnt let them eat. That i refused her a shower. The one that dug the deepest she said i told her i hated her. 

I never did any of these things and now i do not want to see the kids. If he sees them for a day i stay home. If he had them overnight i go to my moms. I am so tired of being demonized for things i never did. I am tired of being lied on. Fiancée has brought this up with kid and ex and it gets thrown on me.

8810,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: I have a sister that is living with my parents along with her two children. One of the children was a result of a teen pregnancy and is 6 years old I’ll call him Gilbert, and the other child’s father is a married man, I’ll call him John and his father George. John is under 6 months old. 

My parents completely support my sister financially as well as her children. She gets child support for the eldest, but puts that money into her retirement fund. 

She has been sleeping with George on and off for a while. George is still actively married, but stays with my sister at my parents house when they are out of town or she stays with him at his grandparents house. When she goes to George’s grandparents house, she takes John with her and leaves Gilbert at home with my parents. She does not call Gilbert, or come to see him while she is staying with George. This leaves Gilbert very sad, he says he misses his brother, John, and he knows that it’s his fault his mom leaves him because he “can’t act right”.  Gilbert does act out when his mom is present. When he makes her angry or acts out she yells and screams at him. She gets easily annoyed and overwhelmed by him so she spends the majority of her time yelling at Gilbert when they are together. 

I also have two children and I try to take them to see my parents fairly often. If my sister happens to be there, she is very rude to me and my older child and she criticizes my parenting. My older child is 2, has speech problems, and is in speech therapy. She thinks it’s because of me that he is behind. 

A few days ago, I went to see my parents and brought my children. My sister was there with her children. While I was leaving, she kept interrupting my conversation with my mother. I told her firmly to stop interrupting, I was not going to fight with her. She kept going. I lost my cool completely. I basically told her to support herself financially like an adult and get out of my parents house. I said she needed to treat both of her children the same or leave Gilbert with my parents for good because everyone was happier when she was away not causing chaos. My sister did not really respond, just repeatedly said “okay” sarcastically. 

My mother has contacted me today to tell me that I need to ignore the behavior from my sister and “love her like Jesus”. She said that I have also made mistakes and I can’t judge my sister. My mother also said that me exploding has made her feel like she has to choose sides and she thinks I want her to turn on my sister. I do not agree with my sister having a relationship with George while he’s married, and I especially do not agree with causing irreversible damage to Gilbert to uphold this relationship with George. I cannot pretend that what she is doing isn’t taking a toll on me emotionally. For this reason I have cut contact with my sister at this time. I have not told my parents what to do, although I do think they are being taken advantage of.

A few days ago there was a car accident outside of my apartment building. This happens often as it is a busy intersection so I thought nothing of it. 

As I pulled into the lot I noticed that a lady was in my assigned spot in said lot. I pulled my car up behind her and kindly asked her to move her car. 

She explained to me that her daughter was one the driver of one of the cars in the accident and that the police had specifically told her to park in my spot. 

Well, I looked around the lot and noticed lots of empty reserved spots and wondered why a cop would tell her to park specifically in my spot. Never mind that there were multiple open spaces on the street. Needless to say I didn’t believe her. 

I explained to her that I pay for that spot and that if I parked in somebody else’s my car would potentially get towed. I even said that she was welcome to park in one of the other open spots or on the street. 

We got into a pretty heated argument which ended with me telling her that I’m going to call the towing company. She moved and gave me many nasty looks.

A little background on my sister: She just graduated from high school and has taken no initiative to do anything with her life. She doesn’t have a job, a bank account, or any type of ID/drivers license. Her main source of income was begging from my dad and stealing from him. She’s his favorite child so she always got stuff from him.

Anyway, other family in the house tried to convince her not to leave and if she really wanted to leave to go into the military or college, which she denied doing. 

I visited her and her boyfriend a day ago and she seemed extremely happy and told me she’s never coming back home and if it doesn’t work out with this guy, she’ll just ask friends to take her in. I tried telling her shes making a big mistake but she cut me off saying I didn’t know what I was talking about and she’s grown so I need to back off and mind my business. It was overall very awkward.

Earlier today, she called asking for money, food, and female hygiene products. She said her boyfriend’s family doesn’t supply much. I went and bought the products but I didn’t give them to her.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.

However, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.

19826,Not the A-hole,"Long time lurker, first time posting. 

Background information: 

One year ago, I (21F) cut out my ex best friend (21F) because she was becoming toxic. She would never text/talk to me unless she wanted to rant or needed something from me. She consistently would ghost me every single time we made plans together. What broke the camel back was when she forgot my birthday (she is always preaching about how birthday are important) TWICE. The first time I forgave her because she said she was planning a birthday party for me. On the day of, she completely forgot and I cut her out completely. I have not contact her. 

The Dilemma: 

A couple of months ago (before the paramedic), she showed up at my house, asking if I could help her.  Apparently, she had told her parents she was staying over my place, but was out partying drinking (she was buzzed and I'm pretty sure someone drop her off because she doesn't have her license). I told her no because I don't want anything to do with her and she has to deal with the consequences for lying to them. She began begging and asked if I could tell them that she had stayed her the entire time. I again told her no and if her parents ask I was going to be honest. 

Her parents are sweet, but extremely conservative. They don't believe that their kids should be drinking, smoking, wearing shorts, hanging out with the opposite sex unless they're planning to marry them, and so forth. If they catch them doing any of the thing mentioned above, then they would be punished. (ie: curfew time would be cut, no electronics, no contact with friends). Basically, they're going to make her life a living hell. Her parents believe in the whole ""my house, my rule"". Since she doesn't pay rent (she told me before we became ex-friends), she has to abide to those rules. 

A few hours later, I heard a knock on the door and I opened it to reveal her parents and her. They were asking me questions like why she was outside and such. I merely shrugged, but didn't say anything. I looked at her and she kept giving me a pleading look, but I ignore it. When her parents asked if she had stayed in my house, I said no.  Then they asked whether or not I knew where she was and I said no. I could tell my friend was getting desperate because she kept trying to answer for me, but her parents would tell her to be quiet and let me answer. After I was done answering their questions, I asked them whether or not they knew we weren't friends anymore. They looked at me surprised while she had the look of horror in her face. Her parents quietly said no and thanks for my help. 

I told a mutual friend of ours about the incident and she said while she understands where I'm coming from, I should have lied because I know how strict her parents are. Apparently, she texted our mutual friend about how I ruined her life and it's all my fault. Her parents aren't paying for her ticket to Paris anymore and her parents are expecting her to pay rent.

I began to notice that Amy would badmouth Jack to me and complain about him, such as his sexuality or lack of money. I thought she just needed to vent but thought they were unfair comments.

Then it got worse. Before we were all friends, a huge party had been arranged. Me and Jack were both invited but Amy was not. Me and Jack had arranged to go to this party months in advance. She knew we were both going and didn’t comment until closer to the time. She asked if we could try get her invited as she wanted to celebrate with us (Amy is shy around people she doesn’t know and didn’t speak to anyone attending apart from us), so we asked but got told no. We asked Amy if she’d prefer if we didn’t go, but she said she had no problem with it and told us that one of her other friends was having a party and she’d just go there.

Sometime later, Jack had informed me that Amy had a fanpage and asked if she’d mentioned it to me. She hadn’t. I thought it was odd she didn’t mention it considering how close we were so I asked her and she was vague about it. As i’m quite nosey, I asked her if I could see it and she wouldn’t let me. Jack ended up finding it. I found almost all of her tweets were aimed at me and Jack, slating us going back to when we first became friends and more recently, about how angry she was about the party. The tweets were really hurtful, some of them had her own MOTHER commenting (she spent most of her time slating people like a teenage girl whenever we visited) She didn’t name us, but the time frames matched up and we knew they were aimed at us. Jack just left it although he was hurt but I confronted her. She denied them being about us, but wouldn’t tell us who they were about. She then blocked us from the account.

I was irritated and used my old twitter account to watch her account. Surely enough, she continued to aim tweets at us and began posting our personal issues on there and mocking us. I confronted her multiple times but she’d just deny it and tweet more, so me and Jack both cut her off and stopped speaking to her.

Me and Jack are still friends to this day, and she is still badmouthing us to whoever will listen but we are still being told that we are horrible people for cutting her off and we’ve left her depressed. Im struggling to see what I’ve done wrong as I confronted her multiple times and she still would lie.

Alright, first I gotta apologize because I've never posted on Reddit and I'm on mobile so I dont know how this is going to work out. 

A little backstory. I (24f) and my family grew up Mormon. I left the church basically as soon as I turned 18. My family is super cool about it, sad and all but they still have me and my kids and husband over for dinners and hanging out and all that. They didnt disown me or cast me out or whatever

My younger brother (18m) drank in high school, vaped, smoked, all that jazz. Then he started dating a little mormon girl, and suddenly decided he wanted to go on a mission. Threw me off, but hey, his life and his decisions. He is out on his mission right now.

Recently, he has decided he wants to come home. Hes only been out for a month, and has decided it isnt for him. My parents are crying constantly and trying to convince him to stay out. He doesnt want to. I've told him I'll support him no matter what he chooses. 

He messaged me yesterday and asked me if I would be the one to pick him up from the airport and if he could move into my house for a while. I said absolutely, just tell me when. I told my parents about this, and they are very upset that I am enabling him to come home early, and that he doesnt know how hard it's going to be for him if he comes home. They think I should tell him no, that I wont help him avoid his responsibilities. I think they are overreacting. Sure I feel bad for them, and i know it's going to be hard on them, but I just dont see it the same. 

So WIBTA if I picked him up and let him stay at my house?

  I'm gay and have known my husband for 4 years, been married for 8 months. I'm also a nurse. On my way home I was feeling adventurous so I decided to pop in at my in-laws' to say hello. My sister-in-law and her husband was also there. They invited me in, we were talking and somehow avoided any conflict (they loathe me and think I turned their son gay, but I tolerated it because I don't have any family of my own).


  The topic of mass shootings and the Orlando shooting came up and I said it's a pity I couldn't donate blood considering I was in the area and have blood type O-, meaning anyone can receive blood from me. I don't know what went through her head but my SIL said it's for the best and that you never know what's in my blood. I informed her I've been tested multiple times and STDs don't appear out of thin air to which she replied ""You probably have AIDS but you don't know it"". 


  When she said that I completely let go and laid into her about everything including how she's in denial about her brother's sexuality, how she sleeps around more than I ever did, and how if she wasn't a high school dropout maybe she'd know then how STDs spread. This led to a HUGE fight between her and her husband and I while her parents just sat there watching. I got up to leave and said I want nothing to do with them and that I was surprised my husband even talks to them at all. 


 And worst part is after I told my husband about this he still chose to defend them. I'm beyond mad at this point, I told him they literally don't acknowledge he's married and yet he still wants to have a relationship with them. To which he said it's none of my business and that I'm an asshole for getting between his family and him. I snapped and told him to grow a backbone.

About a year ago she decided that she wanted to adopt a puppy. It is a terrier and she is very sweet but has just SO much energy. It was easier to manage when we lived together but she has moved out and left me alone with the dog. I work a standard 8 hour day with a 30-45 minute commute each way.

My ex does not have any family where we live and when we broke up essentially jumped on any lease she could find/afford. She was able to find an apartment with a roommate but it does not allow pets. I asked her to take the dog but she obviously couldn’t and told me she still wants her and that she is going to take her when her lease is up. That’s 9 months away at this point and I just felt so bad for this dog that I was essentially neglecting. So, I did end up giving her to a local no-kill shelter. My ex is absolutely furious with me.

11044,Not the A-hole,"My son is 2 and today he had his second day at soccer. He is enjoying it especially the freezies and endless field to run on.

Last week on his first day, my real expectation just him have fun even if he's chasing butterflies. Just running outside and being outside is good. He played well, kind of shy going on the field a lot but he's a shy kid. He enjoys it and looks forward to the next week.

Today, he did really good. He played mosty off field and going on the field to really run on and kick the ball whenever I told him his team needs his help. Rest of time he's running and kicking his own ball which is awesome to see him dribble the ball (whats the soccer term?) My wife was miserable at the game because he wasnt primarily playing on the field like most of the kids and he was playing off field. For me it was fine he going in every now and then (as I said earlier whenever I told him he team needs help) and I will get him to spend more time on the field as the weeks go by (the team loves you helping and he will probably stay).

After the game, I ask him if he has fun he says yes and wants to go back again next weekend. Awesome, he enjoys going out on field. My wife complains again how he never spends time on the field like the other kids implying something wrong him. I told her its normal, my father and brother were both there saying its ok he had he played soccer with himself for now and he enjoys it. She still complains that it isnt normal for him to be 2 and ""far behind"" the other kids. A lot of these kids are from soccer families and this is their 2nd season ( January start ). She doesnt see it that way and disagrees with me.

Not wanted the negativity around his experience at soccer, I tell her next weekend and going forward I dont want her going to his games. I want him to have fun, learn soccer and eat freezies.

9577,Not the A-hole,"Taking the side bar advice on using a throwaway account because of potential outside ramifications. I can’t really ask this question at work so here I am.  

For some background I was deeply in love with my fiancé, we were about two months away from the wedding when I found out he cheated on me. I knew of the girl but had never met her but had it on pretty credible authority that she pursued him knowing he was engaged. It was still his fault so while I called off the wedding but tried to reconcile and forgive, I just couldn’t do it. We broke up but it was a year before I could even face the world socially and 2.5 years before I went on another date. I’m past it but will probably never truly be over the hurt. 

I work HR at a large tech company and am in charge of hiring new people to work in our sales department. The girl in question has a fairly unique first name so when I saw her name I thought it might be her but her last name didn’t match. But when she sat down for our initial interview (me and one other person) we instantly recognized each other. I have to give her full credit, she was nervous for about a minute and then composed herself and gave an amazing interview. Her credentials are spot on and obviously she has the ability to talk and be a good sales person. 

But part of me feels like “fuck you, I don’t need to reward you with a Commissioned sales position with an amazing base salary.” My co-interviewer thought she was a slam dunk but the decision still goes to me. We have interviewed 34 people so I can easily hire someone else and raise no red flags, but the key is she is the most qualified and gave the best interview. 

She sent a very polite email thanking us for the interview and asked if I would be willing to meet with her again to discuss potential “conflicts.” I have yet to respond. I guess I have two choices, meet with her she probably hire her OR I just hire someone else a little less qualified and no one but me will ever know.

Sometimes on his own and sometimes with some friends.
He’s live-streams are fairly decent he has a donation bar , a be right back screen and so on.
He mainly streams games like CS:GO , Apex legends stuff like that.

Last night I was watching his stream. He was streaming with two of his friends and it was going pretty good , the stream was working like normal they where making jokes and laughing which I was fine with because they where funny jokes. 

Until his friend (in my opinion) takes it to far saying out of no where: “my brother had a party and two of his friends that came around where gay. I had to disinfect my whole house , I actually did”

I got really upset and stoped watching the stream then later on my boyfriend called me and I told him I didn’t like his friend. He sounded shocked and asked why so I told him I was upset my the homophobic “joke” this guy made.

My boyfriend defended him saying it’s just a joke and it’s just his friends sense of humour so me and him got into a fight about it.

It might have been a joke and I truly believe with the right audience you can make any joke in the world but on a live stream where anyone could be watching it isn’t right. He also said it so seriously and kinda angry which is what shocked me. It sounded like a statement not a joke.  He wouldn’t make that joke at pride so why make it on a live stream?

4847,Asshole,"I've known my best friend Lisa since middle school and we attended one year of college together before I transferred. We stayed super close through all four years of college though because my new school was in the same city. We've had what feels like thousands sleepovers, dinner dates, movie nights and heart-to-hearts that have cemented our bond as each other's oldest friends.

But for how close we are, we have always hung out one-on-one because she gets SUPER weird around my other friends. With just me, she’s normal and fun and a mostly mellow girl with a big laugh that I love. She doesn’t drink and has anxiety but that doesn’t stop her from meeting new people and being chatted up by strangers all the time because she's very fashionable and has a unique/interesting career. Generally, she's just a cool and normal girl.

But with my other groups of friends, specifically in nighttime settings, she acts VERY weird and is a lock to ruin the vibe. She’ll get quiet and when asked getting-to-know-you questions, she’ll mumble her response or answer while looking only at me (wtf?). She'll make awkward jokes that border on being rude and laugh REALLY loudly over random things that no one else finds funny. For example, at one of my birthday celebrations at a beach house, she wouldn't talk to anyone but me, declined to partake in playing volleyball, and when one of my friends bopped the ball into the window of the AirBnB and cracked it, Lisa laughed SO loudly for about five minutes straight. I knew my friends were miffed because while we were all kind of stressed and trying to evaluate the damage, there Lisa was, sitting by herself laughing nonstop. 

She’ll also isolate one word or phrase from someone’s story that sounds funny to her (and just her) and laugh about that forever. This is stuff she doesn't do one-on-one!! And lastly, because she doesn’t drink, she is not the kind of friend you can leave unattended over the course of the night.

So long story short, I didn’t invite her to my 12-person bachelorette. I did invite some girls I don't know as well and she was devastated. She said that I’m her oldest friend and that she had always looked forward to being with me during all the milestones of my life. She also said I am prioritizing having a ""good drinking crew"" over our 16 years of friendship, which did hit me hard.

But I just want to have a fun bachelorette where I'm not constantly watching out for her and stressing about whether she is happy, or if she is offending anyone by being standoffish and ignoring their attempts to make conversation.

Some of my friends have said that this is harsh and they’d be heartbroken to be left out of such a big event. But I personally have no intentions of changing my mind because shitty as it sounds, I’ve been through this before, and I know group activities are just more fun without her there.

He wanted me to meet her, he really wanted us to get along. He said from the start that it was important to him that I accepted their friendship, she was really important to him and didn't want to be in a position that I felt jealous or weird about him having a female bff.

When I met her, I thought she was pretty cool, but we didn't really get to know each other too well for a while. Until she reached out to me about some harassment she was facing at work, knowing I'd experienced similar things working on the same field. She wanted some advice.

I helped her though a kind of difficult reporting process, through the disappointment and stress that the company didn't seem to be taking it seriously enough, and then through a job-search for a new job. She applied to a lot of places including the company I work for, and ended up accepting an offer from the place I work. 

We became really close friends once we started working together. 

Once covid has hit, the isolation has been tough on us. My boyfriend is kind of an introvert so it hasn't been too bad for him, but Veronica and I are pretty extroverted and were having a tough time of it. 

When my roommate wanted to move out early to go home to quarantine with family, Veronica decided to move in. It's been great to be living with a friend, and since we're coworkers, it actually makes work easier to have both of us working out of the same room.

Jack and I aren't at a point in our relationship where we were considering living together, I know he thinks it's too soon. So he and I quarantining together wasn't really on the table.

Anyway, being roommates and coworkers, and friends... Veronica and I are pretty close with each other, and share a lot with each other. We're both straight lol, this isn't about cheating or anything of the sort. But Jack has started to be upset with me over the friendship regardless.

He said to me that we were becoming unhealthily co-dependant, it's just too much to be living and working and friends with someone. Plus, he said it feels like I ""stole"" his best friend away from him. 

I said it's ridiculous he thinks I stole her. For one, he introduced us and wanted us to get along. And two, I know she still sees him as a close friend! 

He said that it feels unfair that since I'm more of an extrovert, it's like he can't have friends that are his own. 

I said that I was sorry, I thought he wanted me to get on well with her?

We have 4 children together, the oldest is 16 and the youngest is 10. Throughout our marriage, my wife has had difficulty recalling events and conversations. It has been a point of humor at times, and a point of serious contention. 
I recently went back to school, while working full time, and we agreed that she would pick up and handle much more of the day-to-day things. However, there are things that simply do not happen, or are forgotten. A bill didn't get paid on time. A child was not picked up from an activity. She cannot recall key conversations or interactions. She would tell me that she would handle something, or arrange or confirm plans, and then it simply doesn't happen. 
When confronted, she either doesn't recall anything, or recalls events, details and conversations differently. The denial is so adamant, I often wonder if I am crazy. This has put a strain on relationships and our marriage. 
We had a summer vacation planned to take place after summer semester finals. When we were discussing this vacation at the start of summer, she was excited and stated she would handle the camp ground reservations as well as tent trailer rental. 
Monday night, I am sitting at the dinner table, studying for finals. She comes up and asks me how I want to handle the tent trailer reservation. The vacation is the first weekend in August and renting a tent trailer this late in the season has slim to no chance. Even the camp group told us good luck when we called. 

This turned into a serious, serious fight. Everyone has been looking forward to a week camping near the lake. We took a break from arguing, in hopes of calming down, and I realized that I hate my wife. I honestly hate her for the doubt and feeling that I am taking crazy pills feeling. For all the times things have been forgotten or recalled incorrectly. For all the times that she was so adamant in her often, incorrect memory. She has admitted that her recollection is often wrong, and others have gently told her.

My friend is 18 year old gay male. We both just graduated high school. I am straight, but I’m sure some of you will say I am jealous anyway. I recently caught my friend being intimate with a 56 year old man. He didn’t know but I saw them in the mans house. I know this guy, he has a wife and 2 little kids (we love in a fairly small town) Now this isn’t an illegal relationship per say, but I definitely think it is an immoral one. My friend has struggled with depression and other stuff I don’t really understand but it makes him easy to manipulate (I know this because of the actions of some of our classmates). Needless to say I am worried about him. I attempted to talk to him about if he got any romantic interests and he denied it. Finally I got him to admit that he was seeing someone, but he wouldn’t tell me who. I didn’t need an answer cause he hangs around that guys neighbourhood everyday.

So this is the part where I really feel like I sacrificed my integrity. Long story short I anonymously contacted the man through a gay hook up app, and told him that I know who he is, and what he’s doing with my friend, and that if he didn’t stop seeing him immediately I would expose his profile to his wife. So, blackmail. I don’t think it’s illegal because I didn’t ask for money or anything of value but still pretty low none the less. Of course this guy is scum. I don’t regret what I did to him.

I regret not confronting my friend first. The next day he was visibly very upset, and wouldn’t tell me why. I also feel very bad for this mans lovely wife and kids.

They purchased steel straws for everyone and gave them out as gifts. I think there are much bigger problems that contribute to environmental degradation, but I went along with it with the mindset of ""reducing some waste is better than not reducing at all"". We had a family BBQ at which my parents bought plastic straws for the guests. The straws weren't really necessary as people can just drink from the plastic cups which were also purchased. I thought it was a little funny that my parents were using these metal straws while everyone had plastic cups and plastic straws. When Sarah saw this, she took my mom to the side and lectured her on purchasing so much plastic straws. My mom was visibly upset that this couldn't wait until the BBQ was over. I also saw that day my sisters using the plastic cups while glass ones from my parent's house were available. I thought Sarah was being highly hypocritical and called her out on it once all the guests had left. When I mentioned that I saw her using plastic cups, she blamed my mom for purchasing them in the first place and it didn't matter since they were already bought. This upset me since shes kicking my mom while shes already down and that she was being so hypocritical. So I called her out on upgrading her iPhone this year when she had upgraded last year and I said to her that her understanding of environmentalism was akin to that of a teenager following a trend. Upon hearing that she collected all the steel straws that she had bought for us and threw them in the trash saying that we don't deserve her gift and that we can kill the earth if we want to.

4978,Everyone Sucks,"I went to a good friends housewarming party. I brought with me a somewhat ""fancy"" bottle of cabernet that cost around $80. Not the fanciest maybe but I don't usually ball out that much on wine. 

The party was going well and I noticed my wine had been opened and half had been drunk. Somebody told me they were enjoying it and started laughing uproariously. She told me to ask the host why. 

Confused, I did so, I found her and she was very drunk. She told me my wine was a hit but I was mortified to find out that her and a few others were using my wine (along with others) for making ""wine enemas"". 

I thought it was a joke but she was completely serious and took me to to the 2nd bathroom where a few people were gathered, wasted, with enema kits or whatever (I don't know the right word...) and a bunch of towels on the floor. Somebody was in the shower, pants off, laughing and the other people were encouraging her to ""hold it in!"" 

I was absolutely aghast. I asked her to clarify if she had used my wine for an enema and she had. 

I stormed back out to the kitchen, grabbed my bottle, and left the party. I was furious for my wine to be used in this way. 

I got an angry text the next day that it was ""impolite"" to take back a housewarming gift especially when the wine was already opened. I have since heard from other friends that I over-reacted, that it's not my business how people enjoy wine I gifted them, and even some people saying that wine enemas are becoming common and that I shouldn't be so judgmental. I don't know what to think. I find a wine enema disgusting but at least use cheap wine if you have to? 

I don't know.

Was I wrong to take my wine back when it was being used for enemas?

A part of this is intervals, e.g. repeating a pattern of running and walking as prompted by audio cues from the app. Last week was 60 seconds of walking with 15 seconds of running.

Cool, went back to my table, and saw her struggling to get up. Then one of the baristas came, and asked if she could help, the woman tried to get up again and failed, so she let the barista help her. 

She couldn’t help her alone, as the woman was quite big. So another person went to help, a costumer, but they were still struggling to lift her up.

The barista, which was not present when she refused my help, turned  to me and asked if I could help and I said “ I was trying to, but she told me to back off, so yeah, I’m good”.

19699,Not the A-hole,"I sound like TA but hear me out. My neighbor owns a large dog who free roams. It poops in my yard along with everywhere else in the street, since it isn’t being supervised and nobody picks up after it.

This isn’t a farm situation where everyone is massively spaced out, owns acres of land and all the dogs are running loose. We live in the city, close to busy roads with leash laws. 

The other thing that stresses me out is that the dog doesn’t understand property boundaries and frequently guards our own house from us when we come back home. I don’t think it will bite us but it stands there barking aggressively and we typically avoid it because we don’t want to push a reaction.

A part of me thinks calling animal control would make me TA because this dog is old, the experience would no doubt be stressful for it and it probably doesn’t have too long left. At the same time, I am tired of picking up human sized turds on my property for years and having to go around to avoid it when I am just trying to come home from work.

Because I know this will come up, the owner is not approachable. When they see the dog barking at someone else’s house, they scream at it and call it over, but that is about the extent of what they do. Most of the time that the dog is out, they aren’t even there. I don’t want to go into too many details but I wouldn’t feel safe confronting them about the dog because they are not stable people.

So WIBTA if I tipped off animal control anonymously?

Edit: Because this might be relevant. This dog has been free roaming for years (as long as we have lived here) so I don’t think it is in immediate danger, as that has been brought up. It seems to be street smart and our neighbors are all aware of this one free roaming dog and luckily, nobody wants to cause it harm. 

The reason why this is more of an issue for us now is that we have just adopted a dog ourselves. We now have the additional worry of a loose, not exactly friendly dog when we come back on walks. It is getting harder to avoid it because we are entering and exiting our property more than ever before. I am always afraid we will trigger it, especially having a strange, new dog in tow.",26,71,0.89,"WIBTA if I called Animal Control on my neighbors innocent, senior dog",hb07qw,2020-06-17 21:10:02,NTA,2188,WIBTA
12331,Not the A-hole,"If you didn't downvote from the title alone, here is the deal; I teach BJJ and Submission grappling a few days a week at the local club. For those unaware this is the ""ground fighting"" part of the UFC and other mixed martial arts events.

Recently a young man come into my class & says that he would like to join in the adult class as ""my dad says I'm ready for it."" He says he's 13. I sometimes let students that age into the adult class, based on size and maturity. He also has visible tics and minor speech issues. Not a problem, I have several people on the spectrum in my class & I'm a big fan of the ""least restrictive environment"" concept.

I get the rest of the class warming up, take the young man off to ring & to do some of the drills he should know from kids class. Obvious within 5 minutes he either did not pay attention in the kids class or is lacking the co-ordination required. No biggy, I just set him to do the most basic drills on the matted floor where he cant hurt himself and then get the class going.

He's ok with just doing the drills off to the side, but near end of class, he asks ""when are we going to do the powerbombs?"". Turns out some jackass upstairs let him know I was a pro-wrestler in my youth. Thing is that BJJ is real and pro wrestling <SPOILER ALERT> is not </SPOILER>. Big problem for obvious reasons. So I just had him do basic drills for the rest of class, & and at the end he joined in and shook hands with everyone on the way out like everyone else.

After class I speak w/gym owner & tell him I want to talk to kids parents and let'em know he's probably not ready for this class yet (and may never be). Owner says his mom is out of the picture, dad doesn't really care & the kid is only here because of a community program that tries to get him out of home a few times a month and I'll probably never see him again. I figure problem solved, but, in a bizarre twist of fate, turns out he thinks gruff old me is the greatest teacher he's ever had and he continues showing up to my class for several weeks now.

Now others are commenting how it's unfair to keep him off to the side & some teenage students are telling their parents about how I won't include the ""special"" kid in the class, which has lead to some awkward conversations, with some suggesting I ""tone down"" the class so he can be included after I explain why he cannot.

I can't ""tone down"" the class as this isn't a casual class, I have several high level amateurs (international competitors) & even an aspiring pro fighter in the class, & and the club would certainly lose all their business if I turned it into the kind of class this kid could join in.

To me, there is no conceivable way I can safely include him in the regular parts of class but I want to know from an outsiders point of view, Am I The Asshole?

EDIT: I appreciate the judgement and some of the ideas passed on to me in DMs and messages especially those who thought I was the asshole.

She has a different last name now so when I called her for an interview I didn’t realize who she was, and I only used my first name when I called her to set it up. I have been looking potential candidates up on LinkedIn and Facebook and when I found her profile I instantly recognized her. 

I was a year older than all the people in my grade because I started kindergarten late, not because I got held back or anything, but this girl told everyone it was because I was stupid and couldn’t pass my classes. She would also make fun of my hair and clothes and say I was going to die a virgin and stuff like that, and that my only friends were the anime characters I would draw (ok I did have a little bit of an anime phase but I didn’t like go over the top and do the Naruto run or anything and I got over it pretty quick, I just appreciated the artwork and still do).

We walk her to the school bus but since we work we can’t stand with her to make that happen and we don’t want to make the teasing worse PLUS we would like for her to want to go to school, if we forced her to she wouldn’t learn.

She’s wanted a rabbit for some time now and we have told her that if she attends school 100% that on her birthday  she would get a rabbit, her dads idea at the time.

We would make sure it was fed and tidied so I wouldn’t be dumping a living thing on her, plus she’d get a chart to sign every time she’s fed and cleaned it.

Driving back from her family party and after talking about her younger sister not wanting kids we somehow came to her asking me a question.  “Would you break up with me if I couldn’t have children?” I was silent and then responded that’s difficult.

She knows me and knows how important being a father one day is to me. My parents divorced when I was 3 and I grew up in a very unstable and negative environment.

We dated for several months. We were having a lot of fun together, and I thought things were going great.

Again out of the blue, he broke up with me. I was given no explanation why. I felt really betrayed by someone who was one of the most important people to me. Edward avoided me as much as he could. (We still had to work together every day as partners in some classes and especially as teammates in a club.) He left our normal friend group and joined another. He wouldn't talk to our mutual friends and teammates about the situation.

A couple weeks later, I started hearing the rumors and stories that Edward was gay. Then some of our mutual friends starting talking to me about our breakup in defense of him even though I was very upset and just didn't want to talk about him. ""He really liked you as a person but wasn't attracted to you."" ""This was his last shot at pretending to be straight."" ""He was just trying to be accepted."" My friend group split up from arguing over whether or no he was in the wrong.

I felt used. I was his way of confirming he was gay. I was his mask to hide behind for a few months.

Months later, he's now fairly open about being gay. But after all this time, he still never directly told me he was gay. I never got the truth. The only thing he's said about our relationship is that he was happy it happened. But I'm not. I don't think it was right for him to use me like that. I'm not glad that it split up our entire friend group. After everything, I'm saddest about losing him as my best friend.

Some of our old mutual friends blame me for our friend group splitting. I wasn't even in any of the arguments between them about whether Edward was in the wrong. I was a bit busy at the time crying and just being sad. But they say that if I was just more supportive of him coming out everything with our friends would have been fine. (Again, he never even came out to me.) If I was more accepting and happy about the situation apparently everything would have been just perfect.

I'm happy that Edward feels like he can be himself now. I really am. But I can't go back to being friends with him like we were before.  I'm not even sure what I could've done to be more supportive but enough people are still telling me I wasn't supportive enough that there must have been something I'm missing.

3901,Not the A-hole,"This is going to get a bit complex. It also shows how small the world is.  I’ll call my friend Katie. We’re childhood friends who aren’t as close as we were, but that bond from surviving childhood together is strong. Her almost husband is Ryan. My coworker is Chelsea. I’m a bridesmaid in Katie and Ryan’s wedding. 

Katie and Chelsea don’t know each other— they’ve heard of each other and all but have never met to my knowledge. Katie and I live about 1.5 hours from each other- I live in a big city, she doesn’t. I’ve never been a huge fan of Ryan, but he’s not my partner so... eh. He works in sales and is often out of town, including some weekends. Chelsea doesn’t have facebook and is only occasionally on instagram. 

Chelsea came into the office last Monday declaring she had the GREATEST WEEKEND EVER and met a new guy. She was gushing. She basically told a group of us how she spent the weekend with him. She told me his name was Ryan and he was from a town about three hours away, but I didn’t think much of it — it’s a common name, after all! Plus, Katie’s Ryan lives only 1.5 hours away, and I have no idea of his work schedule. 

Finally, someone said they needed to see a picture of “Hunky Ryan.” She pulls up a string of 5-10 selfies — SO NOT CHELSEA LIKE — and to my surprise, the guy was The. Ryan. I asked Chelsea to go out for post-work drinks and spilled that Ryan is my childhood friend Katie’s fiancé, and they’re set to get married next month. Chelsea was understandably upset, but encouraged me to tell Katie. Unbeknownst to me, Chelsea’s high school/college sweetheart cheated on her as soon as they graduated from college half a decade ago. She was Team Fuck Ryan. Chelsea offered to speak to Katie, if Kate wanted. Chelsea told me that in their time together, Ryan talked about prior recent hookups, though she has no information of if those are true accounts or not. 

I told Katie and it was... hard. To say the least. For Katie more so of course. I gave Katie Chelsea’s number. Katie never reached out, which is fine.

Fast forward to this week. I got a long email yesterday morning from Katie saying that she knows Ryan has always struggled with commitment (?) and she believes he had cold feet, which led to an “unfortunate mistake” that they “wish to put behind them as they prepare for marriage.”

I feel uncomfortable standing up in a wedding where the groom was recently so cruel to his fiancé. I believe this is very likely only the first time Ryan has gotten caught, not the first time he’s been unfaithful. At the same time, Katie is a lifelong friend.

5354,Everyone Sucks,"This actually happened a year ago.

One day I was doing some job-hunting, filling out applications and dropping off copies of my resume in person (not a fan of the whole online thing, plus it's more formal). One happened to be this restaurant/bar that I've been to a few times and liked, they seemed to really like me. The next day, I actually happened to be passing through the area again and actually stopped by there, and they remembered me and since the GM happened to be around they offered me an interview.

She was very nice and seemed to really like me when she interviewed me, and enthusiastic about moving forward. She never said 'you're hired' just yet, but she did arrange a time for me to come back for a 'training session'. Seems promising so far.

Fast forward to that day. I come in, turns out she's not there that day cause she had something she needed to tend to. Okay. So I go in, have the training session with a different manager and some other workers. It goes pretty well, they seem to really like me. This seems promising and I'm excited to move forward with this. As far as I'm aware, it went pretty well, nothing went wrong. The manager who trained me even said the words ""**if you want to work here, you can**"" but since the GM wasn't around it needed to run by her first. They seemed like a chill crowd, at the end of my training shift they seemed pretty enthusiastic about seeing me again and said I ""should be getting a call in a few days"".

I wait a few days... radio silence. I try reaching out to them after a week, and the person on the phone actually remembered exactly who I am and was wondering what happened to me as well. Whatever. I know they say 'be persistent' but I'm a little hesitant going back there in person since I don't want to seem desperate. But I did remember them logging the time I was there so I figured there was at least some kind of check I was supposed to be getting.

I visit in person after about a month, since it seems they're ghosting me despite moving that far. The people at the front actually remembered me and asked what happened and seemed just as surprised as me that I wasn't back sooner. They get the manager, which was actually the guy that trained me (GM wasn't in) and he said something along the lines of ""yeah... we're just not hiring right now, try back in ____"". I accepted it but then asked if there was a check, and sure enough, there was one they were sitting on, he went and got me that. So I left, no bridges burnt. Walked out the walk of shame.

I've been told I should 'give them another shot', but I feel like it would make me look desperate. I feel like they might think ""he's coming back after we did that to him?"". And on the other hand, what they did wasn't cool.

8352,Not the A-hole,"I have a female friend (I'm a dude) that has a very annoying habit of sending me a text message, then calling me right after.  If I don't pick up she will call back every 5 minutes, usually at least three times.  It's been up to 5 in a 1/2 hour.  

I've talked to her about this before, and indicated it really irritates me.  She said she understood and would stop.  She was good about it for awhile, but she's been slowly starting to do it again.  

Tonight when it happened I sent her a text saying I would call her when I got a chance, and to stop the multiple calls.  I also reminded her we've had this conversation.  

When I was done eating I called her and she didn't pick up.  Went to take a shit and of course there's a message and a missed call.  Called her back and she was in tears.  Asked her what was wrong and she kept saying I obviously didn't care because I didn't want to talk.  

I don't really talk on the phone to anyone but family.  I don't think I was at all harsh.  I think she's too old for this behavior (30s), and for essentially ignoring what I consider a completely reasonable request.  I admit to being a little hard to get a hold of at times, but calling me once or calling me 5 times isn't going to make me call someone back any quicker and is frustrating if I'm doing something and have to mute the phone.  

Is the multiple call thing some social norm I'm not aware of?  Do women do this with each other?  I have a fair amount of female friends and notice that they will call multiple times a day if I don't pick up (like 2 times over 5 hours which doesn't bother me at all).  I don't really ever talk to my male friends on the phone unless we're trying to nail down specific plans.  

I'm honestly a little lost because of the reaction from someone I consider reasonable.

15049,Not the A-hole,"Background, I'm 25, my sister is 30 and her partner is also 30. Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. 

It's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. 

So, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..

My ex isn't involved in Luna's life that much. He was present for the first couple years but just didn't want to be a dad, so he pays child support and shows up every now and again (2 or 3 times a year) to see Luna, but that's about it. His parents, however, are involved. I've known them for years and my own parents aren't involved in my life, so they are Luna's only set of grandparents.

Luna is 8 years old. My ex's parents never really liked her name, and called it ""hippy dippy bullshit"" when I told them what her name was, but seemed to accept it and move on. The last time they spoke to Luna was over the phone about 2 months ago, and I heard them calling Luna ""Lily"" over the loudspeaker. I'd never heard them call her that before and Luna frowned when she heard it, so after the call I asked Luna if that was a nickname they gave her, and she said yes. I asked if she liked it when they called her that, and she said no. I said that I'd never heard them call her that, and she said they only do it when I'm not there and she's been ignoring them when they call her Lily and saying she didn't like it, but then her nan says she's being rude so she feels like she has to respond to ""Lily"".

Today we were meant to have a video call. I called them, said Luna had told me about ""Lily"" and she didn't like it, and from now on use of ""Lily"" results in me hanging up on them. I then called Luna in, said I'd go check dinner, and I barely got to the door when I heard ""hi Lily!"". True to my word, I then walked the 2 or 3 steps back to the laptop, joined Luna on screen, and said ""bye"" before I hung up on them. Luna thought it was really funny and thanked me and my boyfriend agreed with me, but my ex and his parents are both mad at me, saying it was an honest mistake, they've been calling her Lily for years, and I can't expect them to break a habit like that so fast. They also want an apology for hanging up on them so abruptly. I've responded that I intend to do it again and again until they call Luna by the name she prefers. They've responded that this is very immature of me and I shouldn't be barring their access to Luna over ""petty"" things like this.

We both started college this year, and she's taking a philosophy course for spring semester. Lately, almost every time she calls me she starts talking about some new moral dilemma/philosophical issue that she learned about in class and asks me what I think. It's pretty interesting and I wouldn't mind except that if I ever disagree with her she gets annoyed with me and asks how I could possibly think that. For example, maybe I'm just an asshole, but I think it definitely makes sense to kill one person to save the many, and she disagrees. Sometimes I feel like she believes she has a greater/better moral compass than me and honestly maybe she does, but she's the one who keeps bringing up these hypothetical situations and getting annoyed when I don't agree. She asked me if I would abort a down syndrome baby and I said yes, and she gasped and asked me how I could possibly do such a thing and acted like I was a horrible person. It just makes me feel like she looks down on me cause she thinks I'm immoral or something, but honestly I think my views are relatively rational and they're not that far out there. 

She also became a vegan about a year ago, which I'm fine with but I eat meat. I agree that the treatment of animals in slaughterhouses and stuff is horrible, but honestly I just don't want to give up eating meat. Maybe that does make me a bad person, idk.

It got to the point that they and my older sisters would correct anyone who would call me “Tommy” in front of them.

I didn’t care, really, because no one ever called me it patronizingly. I had friends that would at school and it continued, into high school especially.

Our child has a dark complexion and brown eyes even though my wife and I are both very pale and have blue eyes. It was a bit surprising for me, but I never really gave the idea that this child was not my own any serious consideration. 

Flash forward to three years after our child is born and my wife and I get divorced. Our divorce was unpleasant but all things considered, not nearly as bad as it could have been. There was no infidelity or any irredeemable mistake by either party, just two people who no longer wanted to be together. 

We share custody but my son lives primarily with my ex-wife and her boyfriend. As the boy has gotten older, his features have almost entirely diverged from mine and he now looks absolutely nothing like me. 

Again, I thought nothing of it, as I trusted my ex-wife, but a couple of weekends ago when I was visiting him, I made a joke to my ex-wife that people will think I kidnapped because of how different we look. 

She then bursts into tears and admits that the child is most likely not my own. I am absolutely stunned and didn’t interrupt her once as she spilled an entire saga of her cheating on me with her current boyfriend around the time we were trying to get pregnant. 

I thought I was going to throw up when I heard and immediately left her home. I don’t know if I can ever go back or ever see “my son” again. I feel emasculated and deeply betrayed by my ex wife. 

My wife insists that I remain a part of this “family,” despite all of the deceit. She has called me a deadbeat for leaving after she told me the truth and not sticking around to raise “my son.” She claims that even after all she’s done to me, I am the asshole. 

I know none of this is my son’s fault and I still care a great deal about his well being, but I just don’t think I can be a father to a child that is not my own, especially when the child’s actual father is fully in his life. I feel like an unnecessary appendage in this relationship and I refuse to be humiliated any further. Am I the asshole for refusing to raise a son that is not my own?

Clarifying point: I plan on doing an official DNA test before I make any lasting decisions. But I don’t feel ready to have to conversation with my ex wife yet. She seems convinced her boyfriend is the father, not me. For now, I am keeping my distance. As much as I might despise them, the child is perfectly safe with my ex wife and her boyfriend.

17963,not the a-hole,"I struggled with writing this. I'm in the closet to everyone so throwaway account for obvious reasons.

My roommate is a straight man, let's call him Tom. We share a two bedroom and have been friends for like a year.  Anyway, he will sometimes walk around the apartment naked in the shared living areas (living room, kitchen, etc.). I will just say real quick that he has a great body all around.  He doesn't know I'm gay and I believe he likely wouldn't be doing this if he knew I was.

I have to say, I have never had this problem with a roommate before, EVER! And I would never walk around naked outside of my bedroom so I find the behavior very bizarre.  

Let me give an example of what he does. The other day I was watching football, he was in the shower. He got out and crossed through the living room, between the couch where I'm sitting and the tv to get to the kitchen to have a drink. I obviously saw everything. He then stood in the living room and watched the end of the game before going to his room to get dressed (the game was almost over).

I try really hard to avert my eyes in these scenarios.  If there wasn't a game on I probably would have just left the room and came back when he was dressed.  In order to be completely honest, while I do avert my eyes most of the time, there have been a couple of times when I've looked. (I'm a weak man).

I've confronted him about this and told him I'm uncomfortable with his nudity and asked that he stop.  He has one of those douchebag-y personalities where if he knows something bothers you he just does it more, for lolz, so that backfired on me.  He's really liberal and has a gay brother so I don't think he'd be homophobic if I came out but with his personality in mind I know that if I told him I'm gay and not to tell anyone he would tell everyone and laugh off my dismay.

So this is my dilemma. Some days I wake up and think I'm a huge asshole and a creep for not being upfront about my sexuality with this guy. He would never show his body off like that if he knew and I do get turned on by his behavior as much as I try to avoid it.  On other days I think what right does he have to know I'm gay.  My sexuality is my business, I haven't come out to anyone and I sure as hell don't want to come out to him. I've already told him to stop and he won't so it's not my fault.

So roomie in question (Elon) was a pretty good kid, aside from some minor drug consumption. We were splitting the rent so I was paying 50% of rent (biggest room, private bath, all home items that furnished the apt), our other roomie (Felix) was paying 30% and Elon was paying the last 20%. Also noted that Elon and I work in the same place, but worked different shifts.


The first day, after I had gone to sleep, his group of friends (maybe 6 or 7) had a small hangout. We didn't have furniture out or internet yet so I set up my TV, movies I had, and my extra blankets for them. When I woke up, Elon was rocking back and forth in the living room with 2 of his friends (one we'll call Marzio), one was passed out half naked in the kitchen. Apparently, the half naked friend got drunk, made a mess of the shared bath, started causing trouble and got caught by apt security. His ex girl in the mix was doing shitloads of coke all over his room, also her car got towed out because she parked in front of someone's garage. We only got a warning. He told me he wasn't letting half naked friend come back.


A month or so later, Marzio and Elon had a friend over. I went in my room so they could chill and do their own thing. A bit later my pups start barking, and it was a little unusual so I go out to the hallway - all of a sudden a guy kicks down the front door, stares me straight in the eye, and runs away. Scared as fuck, I knock on Elons door, both of them come out of the room looking down. They told me they knew their friends boyfriend was coming to cause trouble. We had cops come, we all concluded to not have that friend over again.


Time passes, he is having at least 3 to 4 people over every day, in and out all day long. It's a little exhausting to Felix and me as we are socially introverted. But we try to stay in our rooms instead at this point and let him kind of have the rest of the apt, since we dont have large friend groups and like spending time in our rooms. We understood this is his first ""his"" space, if that makes sense.


A month later, another one of Elons friends ended up starting to nic cigarettes and other consumables from Felix and my possessions. It was at this point both Felix and I finally got upset and told him we didn't want him to have friends over unless we knew them (this included Marzio and about 4 of the others that we knew were ok). We discussed, it seemed ok.


Later on, I found out he was telling our work that I was a tyrant asking this of him, he was paying for the space so he should have whoever he wanted over at any time, and that I was a bad roomie for imposing something so restrictive on someone with a large social circle.

Not knowing who or what God I'm believing in used to be a struggle to me, but I found my peace in the thought that at the end of the day, everyone's kind of praying to the same deity, just with different names.. Sometime ago I started wearing  a Christian rosary necklace, it makes me feel grounded and connected, but also because I really dig the aesthetic. But I can't help wondering if this might be appropriation. Also, in my home there are some little Buddha figures at my shrine.. Is it wrong to mix religions like that?

My husband and I have a son. He's just turned five. The early years were the normal struggle of trying to teach basic human functioning to a kid, but now it's become so fun! During this time there were definitely  low points, when he wouldn't sleep, juggling work and childcare, potty training, etc. There were quite some bad days, but my husband and I got through them and my brother in law and his wife have never been asked to help. Whatever their plans are at home or out, we have never asked them to change their plans or watch our kids.


Recently they had their own child and are going through the newborn stage. Sis in law is on maternity leave and brother in law is working. So a few days ago, I pick up my son from school and we come home before going to a highly anticipated trip to the movies. When we get home, sister is in the living room in tears. It seems her newborn didn't sleep much and has been colicky all day. I sympathise with her and tell her that this stage will be over soon.Then my son and I leave for the movie.


Today my husband told me that both my brother in law and his wife are angry that I didn't offer to take care of the baby for a while so she could have a break. I'm kind of shocked that I'm being asked to do something that they never have offered to do and we have never asked them to do. I feel like they should take care of their kid just like we did.

With the general classes, I didn't really struggle, but with these hard classes, I have to study a lot to do well, but I haven't been really getting good results. The problem is that whenever I sit down, no matter how much I want to study, my mind would drift, before it wouldn't be much of an issue, but nowadays, I have to make sure I am studying the full 5-6 hours I allocate my self to studying. I wasn't sure why I couldn't focus, so I googled, potential reasons as to why I could be having these issues, whether it be diet or whatever, but this article on ADHD symptoms caught my eye, and I realized that I had many symptoms of this disorder.  I obviously am not a doctor, so I wanted to get a medical diagnosis to make sure I was. I asked my mom about my insurance and told her I wanted to get this diagnosis. I explained to her the situation and she said, what's the point? I said, if I did have ADHD, then they would have to prescribe medication to me so I could focus and study. This really made her upset, she doesn't know anything about ADHD, in fact, I had to explain to her what it was, yet she said I shouldn't be taking any medication, no matter what. I told her that this isn't fair, as I would be struggling for no reason. So, I made the decision as an adult and said no, I would be getting this medical diagnosis no matter what she says and I will be listening to the doctor.

I have *never* done this before but something struck me to unlock her phone with her passcode (we use each other's phones all the time). I admit I crossed a line with mutual trust in each other by checking her text messages and I found more than 1 text thread with other men. These messages were sexual in nature, including dick pics being sent to her, and her actively engaging and suggesting that they will eventually make a ""snuggle date"".

When she gets back I ask her to explain. This turns quickly into ""but how dare you go through my phone"" kind of argument rather than a ""you're sexting other men behind my back"" argument.

I travel a lot for work and was recently in a really dope city for a conference in which I got put up in a super swank hotel. I match with a girl from tinder and we exchange snap usernames and start talking on there. We send a couple of innocent snaps before she mentions she is in an Open relationship and was just looking for no strings attached sex, pretty much a hot romp 1 off. This piques my interest immediately and tbh I started getting a bit hard and my thoughts racing. I ask her when she wants to meet up and she tells me she'll get through with her day and then hit me up.

Blood rushing to my dick, I send her a couple video snaps of my suite. This thing is seriously huge. Double room. Sweet bathroom. Amazing view with a balcony. I follow up with where I'm staying, that I have a private super swank room and that maybe she should come over when she's done with work. She opens the vids and says the room looks great, thanks for the view and offer etc etc but that she has had bad experiences with meeting strangers at hotels in the past and that she would rather meet somewhere neutral first to see if we vibe. I say okay.

About 5 minutes later, I'm completely hard and looking over this girl's pics and get a bit caught up in the moment of possibly banging someone elses girlfriend in a city i'm visiting. I send her a quick dick pic and a view of the skyline from my balcony and tell her ""Or you should just come over right now and I can fuck you against this window.""

She shuts down immediately. Calls me an inconsiderate asshole for ""pressuring"" her after she told me she had a bad experience.

20433,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account.

So, this happened a couple of days ago. I asked a couple of friends about this, and one of them suggested I should write and ask about it here. I’m not a native speaker, so excuse my mistakes.

I (26F) have a 2 year old son. I was having a conversation with a friend and mentioned that my son doesn’t really like to shower, but loves baths, so when I do prepare a bath for him we usually bathe together. I bring all kinds of toys and cups, because he loves to spill water on himself and even more when he splashes it at my face. If you ask me it’s a win-win situation. I can wash my hair and his at the same time, and he loves the play time with me in there.

The response I got was not what I expected. She looked actually disgusted. She said what I was doing is very inapropriate especially because he is a boy and that I’m emotionally and possibly sexually abusing my son. I disagreed and we had a huge fight. When I told my other friend what happened she said she sees her point and maybe I shouldn’t do this anymore.

I am so confused and I’m wondering if AITA for bathing with my son? Am I abusing him?


Edit: Yesterday I wrote a comment thanking everyone for their response, but as this post blew up it probably got lost down there. 

So I will say it here again THANK YOU ALL! You have put my mind at ease. I would never ever ever do something to hurt my boy. I was so confused and anxious (especially being first time mom) so thank you for all of your comments and personal experiences! Took me a while to get through them but I appreciate all of them.

3353,No A-holes here,"Sorry, this is my first post on Reddit because I'm kind of concerned about my roommate. She's a freshman and at the beginning of the year, I thought she was really quiet and she was in the room a lot (she plays video games and watches Netflix, primarily), but I thought she was otherwise fairly typical. However, I recently found out that she switched all her classes to online versions of the class and that she's been eating frozen meals instead of going to the dining halls. I was recently sick for a couple of days (so just went to classes that had tests for an hour/1.5 hour) and then went straight back to my dorm. I don't think she left the dorm the entire time. I've tried inviting her out for food or just to hand out with friends, bust as far as I can tell, my question is not an exaggeration at all.

 I'm concerned because it can't be good for her physically or mentally to stay in our tiny room all the time. I'm hoping my RA would be able to tell me that she is already aware of this or she'd be able to refer my roommate to some help. At the same time, I feel like I might be tattling on her and as someone who is also pretty introverted, I can kind of understand why she doesn't want to leave.

127,Not the A-hole,"My ex and I were together 3 years. We were engaged, and then I got pregnant. We'd discussed kids previously and agreed on 2 or 3 but since finding out my ex has said he doesn't want to be a father and, as the way I'm referring to him may suggest, he has ended our engagement, because I want to keep the baby. Apparently he'd hoped I'd change my mind and settle for a pet after we got married. 

I found out the gender about a month ago, and I picked out a first and middle name, both fairly ordinary (they're both in the top 100 most common boy names) so it's nothing weird, cruel or unusual, but I like the names, and I picked them both from things significant to me (one is a book I love, one is a song my dad used to sing to me when I was a baby). When people have asked I've told them what the name will be.

A lot of people have been asking about the name/gender so I decided to make a Facebook post a few hours ago saying that the baby's name is FirstName MiddleName Surname, and it's a boy, and I didn't think any more of it after that.

And then I get a message from my ex, saying he didn't like the name. I tell him that's not really my problem. Or his, seeing as he won't be involved. He then reminds me that the middle name is the same first name as a kid who bullied him in primary school (ages 5-11) and accuses me of choosing a name I knew he'd hate to get back at him for not being involved. I responded that I genuinely did not remember the name of one of the kids that bullied him (there were about 10), it's a common name and again, it shouldn't matter to him as he isn't involved.

Ex and I did discuss baby names while we were together, and we did have a list of names we liked, but when I was choosing my son's name I didn't want to refer to the list I'd made with my ex for obvious reasons. Ex did ask what happened to the list, and I said that was a list we made for the kids we were having together, not a child I was raising alone, and the list was entirely compromises I'd made, for example I'd suggested Aiden, he said he didn't like it but he'd accept Adam, I said I didn't like Adam but Adam ended up on the list and Aiden didn't.

Ex has replied to my post saying that I'm being vindictive by naming ""our"" child a name I knew ex had bad connotations with. Ex's family I'm linked to and some mutual friends have liked the comment and messaged me privately asking why I'd do this to the father of my child.

I've talked to a couple of my friends/family and I've been given advice ranging from take the post down to change the name, and it's the people who are on my side, not Ex's, who are still suggesting I change the name that are giving me pause, because there's quite a few of them and if they're suggesting a name change then I feel like I fucked up, but I genuinely didn't remember Ex had bad associations with this name and I still love the name.

AITA for picking/not changing the name despite the connotations the father has?

Info: the name my ex is objecting to is James as a middle name (not first name), and James was apparently the name of one of my Ex's childhood bullies.

She passed a few empty seats, even those for the elderly/handicapped and stopped almost between us and looked at the window seat behind me.

20709,Not the A-hole,"Read the whole post, I hate AITA posts that are too obvious so I’m phrasing it in this way to leave your thoughts as unbiased as possible since I clearly am biased and that will likely come off.

So my husband is a slob. Horrible disorganized mess. Borderline hoarder habits. It’s been a long road. The man will leave garbages without bags (filling them...) will fill both sides of the sink to the brim with dishes and food, and will go a full year without cleaning the dryer lint out of the dryer if left unchecked. 

Myself, on the other hand, am very clean and organized. I bear the mental load for most of the family business. I plan doctors visits, handle all of the finances and bills, do the taxes, maintain chore lists for the home, and am big on keeping things maintained. 

I get on my husband a lot. Not in some out of line naggy wife way, but in a “This is the third churdled cup of milk I’ve found on your side of the room this week way” (I’m NOT joking. That was yesterday) I don’t want to have to say half the things I do but yes I regularly need to remind him of things like “You need to roll the windows up in the van, it’s going to rain tonight” and “Please stop leaving your clothes in the bathroom, the basket is just outside.”

It’s been a rough week for him and I’ve had to scold him for some things (ie: the foul milk cups) so idk if he was just trying to level the playing field or what but this morning we got into it because apparently I “have different standards for myself”.

So I’m doing my morning workout (I do fitness programs on the tv in the living room) and it involves a lot of burpees and I’m getting little particles on my hands. So I grab the broom and quickly sweep the dust out of my space. Mind you’ve I’ve already swept 3 times this week so it wasn’t out of hand, just a little dusty. I put the broom away.

Well husband immediately gets on me because I put the broom away without dusting it up and throwing it away. I said, “I’m in the middle of my workout, I can do it when I’m done.”

He kept on me saying, “You are always on me to finish tasks that I start! If I did that you’d be mad at me!”

I said “It’s different. When I say I’m going to do it after my workout you can trust me because I have a long-standing history of doing what I say I’m going to do. I get mad at you when you say you’re going to finish things later because you don’t. You’re just trying to start a fight with me.”

He said “No you’re the one starting a fight because you can’t just admit you’re holding yourself to a different standard than you hold me.”

I insisted that I earned being held to a different standard and that he needed to stop before he pissed me off for the whole day. He insists he’s right, and that I apparently should have stopped my workout for longer and finished the entire task by stopping and sweeping it all up then and there. In my opinion, I felt it was a degradation tactic (he was trying to humiliate me by “catching me” doing something wrong such as how he feels when I call him out) and was not going to bow down.

697,Not the A-hole,"My flatmate (M) is habitually messy and unclean in our shared kitchen (university, 8 people). It's a classic tale.

Last term he threw a christmas party in our shared kitchen on a Friday night: he specifically told the rest of his flatmates (7 of us) that we specifically couldn't attend or be in our own kitchen that evening, as it was for his friends only. Unimpressed, we chose to put up with it, but made it obvious to him that we also planned to have a Christmas Dinner in the same kitchen the next day. He promised it'd be cleaned up in time, no questions asked.

Cut forward to 1pm the day after his party. We'd made it clear to him that we wanted to begin prepping our dinner at 2pm (and we invited him!), but I enter the kitchen to find it in an absolute disgrace. Baking trays (including my own!) full of now-hardened grease, a tray of remaining stuffing and sprouts left out for 18+ hours, drinks open and sat everywhere, you name it.

Me and two others decided enough was enough, and got about to cleaning it up. We weren't going to let him ruin our own Christmas Dinner. We're halfway through washing up and cleaning all his mess (1:30pm), when he comes in claiming to have just woken up, and saying he was just about to clean it all himself. I grew quite agitated, and told him, ""I'm sorry, but that just isn't good enough. You either wake up to clean it on time as you promised, or you do it after the party with all your friends."" 

He stormed out, muttering about how unfair we were being, as we washed up his plates and swept up his crumbs. It felt like a major slap in the face. He didn't come back to actually help, as he said he would. I can definitely see why he'd feel cornered, and perhaps I shouldn't have been so short with him when he'd come in to try and clean it (albeit a little late).

My other flatmates told me I'd stayed civil and not to worry about it, but later the next day, I check my phone to see him & his friends had put me on blast in a large group chat for our apartment block. 80+ people, all stating that we were out of order. He claimed in there that we were rude and treated him like a child, and that we were ""bullying him out of the university"". Moreover, he called me out by name to 80+ people for ""throwing away all his leftovers"", when my other flatmates can attest to the fact that what we threw out was probably a single portion of cold, sad stuffing and sprouts. I felt sick to my stomach seeing all these people call me a bitch, etc, etc.

I even extended my apologies for the food in the following few days, but he called it ""petty bullshit"" and stormed out. I can understand why us binning the food may have pissed him off, but this all feels unreasonable.

A lot of the apartments were too expensive for our budget but we found 1 that we’re happy with. The complex was very nice and the lost cost we were told was 890/mo for 1 bed/1 bath. We were also informed of this application where if you and whoever are living in the apartment are making less than 32000 collectively a year then you apply for the “bond program” (I think it was called) that let’s you live in their studio apartments for less rent (about 550 a month not including utilities) We asked about the availability of the apartment and they told us that there are a lot available right now so it’s not like people are scrambling to get in.

My gf has been looking for a new job and would like to switch to full time when she finishes college. I told her that she should wait until we apply and get the verification that we apply for the program to actually go full time and she agreed. We wouldn’t apply until July. (She’s not struggling for cash or anything and i would help out if that ever were the case, this would strictly be to save money in the long run).

We also started trying to attack our debts together and would be basically living like poor people for the foreseeable future until we were out of debt. So this program would give us a head start. After the leasing period, if your income rises above 32000 a year you’d be asked to move into the normal studio (which is the same size and specs as the bond program one).

We cooould afford to live in the normal apartments comfortably but it would take longer to pay off our debts.

Eventually I got a call from my son's girlfriend that lives with him. She said that she knew what was going on and felt guilty. She basically told us that our son had made up the story about the TV breaking and stole it and took it to their house to watch. 

I filed a police report and his girlfriend let the police into their house to get us our TV back. We do plan on pressing charges against him. He stole our TV and made my daughter pay for it.

1729,Not the A-hole,"So, this is a weird one. My girlfriend of 3 years and I were watching a show which involved organ harvesting(family friendly fun right?), and so the topic got onto opt in/vs opt out organ donation She said that she would donate organs if someone she knew needed it. I basically said that when I'm dead do whatever, but when I'm alive the only situation I could see myself donating an organ is if either my parents, my future kids or my wife(I was thinking it might be her but not so sure anymore...) needed it. 

So, it turns out her sister has some sort of degenerative disease? I don't really know what, but essentially her kidneys are slowly getting destroyed. My girlfriend and her family aren't a match. Apparently she's on the waiting list, but isn't really in risk of dying anytime soon. She flipped the fuck out, saying how selfish I was and that she would donate a kidney for someone in my family(I strongly suspect this is not true but I'll take her word for it here).

I responded essentially that I sympathize with her sister's problem, but I'm not prepared to commit to donating a kidney to her, and that the conversation had sort of spiraled out of control from what we were originally talking about.

She said she was going to her parents house and I haven't heard from her in a few days. I feel bad, but I'm going to donate my kidney to her sister, especially if she didn't even ask?

22341,Not the A-hole,"A little background: 
I’ve been in my house for 2 years. I’m very active in my yard and the upkeep of my home.
Several months ago, my neighbors asked to remove the hedges that were between our houses - they said they didn’t like them. Unfortunately we said we were okay with it and even helped pay for half the labor to remove them and dispose of them. 
Because of this, we had to fence our property so our dog wouldn’t leave our yard and in between the homes we put in a 6ft privacy wood fence. Otherwise we would have zero privacy in our home. 
I paid for the fence. It sits about 2--3inches into my property line; so not on the border. During the construction of the fence, my neighbor attempted to stop the work crew while I was out because she was not happy with how the fence was facing (cedar pickets were faced in toward my home— I get it. Etiquette usually states the “nice side” should be out, but I assumed that was a standard rule and didn’t realize they would face in). Couple weeks pass in which I have had to apologize profusely and check and double check to make sure nothing was illegally done on my property. Today, my neighbor decides to drill a hole into the fence (on the side that faces their house) in order to install a metal hanger and large plant. There was zero conversation of: hey can I do this? So I said I was not happy and they should’ve asked for my permission. 
They took it down. AITA?",234,1125,0.95,AITA for not wanting my neighbor to drill holes into my wooden fence?,hkvcrc,2020-07-04 01:56:06,NTA,1420,AITA
15027,Not the A-hole,"Hi all! 

Long time lurker, first time poster on this subreddit! I'm currently in a bit of a pickle and seeking opinions.

To preface this, I am an insomniac and so it takes me a while to fall asleep. That initial moment of falling asleep is so crucial for me because if it gets interrupted, I end up staying up longer and there goes my productivity the following day. I should also mention, I share a room with my 3 sisters. 

The sister who this post is about, has a boyfriend who she's been with for a few months. They talk every day and every night. It's gotten to the point where they fall asleep on the phone together and if the call drops, he rings her back. You would think common sense would prevail and he would assume she is sleeping, but no. He rings and rings and rings.

Normally I just suck it up since I'm already awake and there's no way of me going back to sleep. But last night was the final straw for me. It was 1 am, I could feel myself drifting off to sleep, and he fucking called her!! She eventually picked up and was whisper-speaking to him. 

I've had it with the ringing. I want to approach her and ask that they enforce some boundaries for e.g. No calls past 9pm. WIBTA for asking her to create some boundaries when it comes to phone calls?

6810,No A-holes here,"I work with a consulting company that basically automates people out of jobs. In the past financial year we're directly responsible for X-thousands of people being made redundant and saving companies fat stacks of money. Basically, people are fallible flesh-bags and where practical we try and replace it with predictable, repeatable solutions.

This came to awkward scenario. We did an audit of a local industrial company that my parents work at. Throughout this audit, at times, I had to interact with departments/areas my parents were involved in to elicit processes, requirements, etc. After the review, we found we could cut over 60 jobs and improve output with introduction of a particular of-the-shelf solution that required some modification. We provided training and additionally audited aptitude and performance to note which workers would be best to retain, retrain or retrench.

The result (based on metrics and my work) was that my parents were part of this mass redundancy. I was not allowed to give my parents a heads up. After the news, my parents were/are livid at me. They're telling me I had no loyalty to them and should have fudged numbers to keep them there because they're not not going to find new jobs at their age. They asked me how I can sleep at night knowing I put them out of work. 

I told them that I take my job seriously, do my job well and I'm proud of doing a good job. But now my parents, siblings, extended family and some family friends are pretty much angry at me. I've gotten various messages that follow the theme that I should be ashamed.

18938,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because I'm gonna reveal some medical info and some IRL people know my main account.

Wife had a C Section about 3 months ago. She was prescribed Norco (Hydrocodone) for the pain. We filled the prescription (20 pills) and then she never took it. She used Motrin and Tylenol only. The pill bottle went into the medicine cabinet in the bathroom where we forgot about it.

Fast forward to Christmas Day. We don't want to take an infant around to all our families gatherings in flu season, so we stayed home and invited anyone over who wanted to stop by during the day.

My wife's sister (so my SIL) Jane and her boyfriend Bob came by. Jane and Bob have been dating for a few months. I never met the guy before. My wife met him once. My point is that I don't know this dude from Adam, but he seemed like a nice guy. They stayed for a while, played with the baby, exchanged some presents, and we all had a good time before they left to go to their next stop.

A few days later, Jane calls my wife irate and screaming. Bob stole the Norco. He is apparently a recovering addict who has been clean less than a year. We obviously didn't know this. He has now vanished. His work hasn't heard from him, his parents haven't heard from him, and Jane hasn't heard from him. He could be on a bender or dead for all we know. Jane went to his apartment when he wasn't responding to her and that's when she found the empty pill bottle with my wife's name on it and called us screaming.

SIL blames us and is beyond pissed, which I can understand. She needs an outlet for her anger. What I don't understand is about half the family blames us too. They understand we didn't know about Bob's addiction history, but they said having unused narcotic medication just sitting around is irresponsible and we created this problem. It's causing a bit of a rift between the people blaming us and those not blaming us, and we (and my mother and father-in law) are caught in the middle because SIL has been on a rampage against us for ""destroying her life.""

I'm trying to be empathetic to Bob and SIL, but I don't agree. First, we legitimately forgot about it. Neither of us take medication regularly, and we had a newborn to deal with, so we weren't thinking about a bottle of pills in the corner of the medicine cabinet. Second, Bob didn't know the pills were unused. We don't know him and he doesn't know us. For all he knew, my wife could have a chronic condition and need those pills. It's not like he would recognize the prescribing doctor's name is an obstetrician. Am I not allowed to have medicine in my own house on the off chance that a recovering addict will come by and see it? 

I think Bob is firmly the asshole here and my wife and I don't have any responsibility. If we had known he was an addict and still left the pills out, then maybe, but we didn't know.

But, I don't have any experience with addiction or even taking narcotic pain meds, so maybe I am the asshole for not being more diligent about getting rid of the pills. 

AITA?

EDIT: Thanks all. 

I'm glad my initial reaction wasn't off base. For those asking how anyone could blame us, scroll down to the ESH verdicts because a few posters have nailed the exact things some of the family is saying. Not so much that it's our fault Bob stole the pills, but that we are ""part of the problem"" that has allowed the opioid crises by not securing or disposing of the pills.",4291,17592,0.84,AITA for having narcotic pain meds in my medicine cabinet?,eluqog,2020-01-08 16:10:44,NTA,3426,AITA
13214,Everyone Sucks,"I am a 24 year old autistic woman. I was talking/joking about my sensory issues and how lots of noise or action sets me off and gives me panic attacks. Basiclly I was saying that I wish people would be less noisy in public (I live in a college town so there are always lots of excitable people carrying on everywhere). I specifically was talking about how the last time I went out to eat I had to leave because there was a bunch of drunk guys from my school hooting and hollering and a kid screaming it's head off and the noise made me panicked. I get that that's my problem but who does not bitch and moan to their friends sometimes?

A girl in my common room took this as a personal attack on her and aggressively snapped at me that she is an autism mom and her kid has outbursts and I 'need to deal with it and get over it' because 'you're an adult and they are a child so it's worst for them' and 'I have higher expectations for adults than kids. You should have higher expectation for yourself'.

I have a temper. I've always had a temper. Instantly the implication that you can walk autism off with age pissed me off. Her not being a part of the conversation but busting in pissed me off. Her being so aggressive pissed me off. Her talking over me (a problem a lot of autistic people have with self proclaimed 'autism moms') pissed me off. And lastly the pure condescension in her voice when she implied I am not meeting her expectations pissed me off. So I opened my mouth to tell her to f#ck off but the anger took over and what came out was 'Sit down you annoying f#cking b#tch I can't stand you people'. She then offered to 'beat my ass' and our friends separated us. This isn't the first issue we have had. Last year me and the same girl got into it because she was listening to music with no head phones in during study hall. It's the only two times we have talked and the first time I think I was justified but I worry I was too aggressive this time around.

5908,Not the A-hole,"Using a throwaway to doubly make sure this can't get back to my family. 

For some background, my niece will be 16 in September. My brother and his ex divorced about 2 years ago but she's in the military and while they share custody they decided it would be best for the kids to live full time with him since he has better access to schools, family and stability. I am very close to both my niblings. I'm 24 for reference. 

A week or so ago my brother found my niece's ""sex diary"" and snooped. He took pics and sent them to me and honestly, having a been a teenage girl it wasn't too bad. It was pretty normal stuff like she'd had a kissing contest with her friends and she had won by kissing 24 guys in a week. She's done oral sex and really wants to get on the pill. I guess the most ""troubling"" thing to my brother was that she seems to have a fixation with older guys (to me this is totally normal since teen guys sucked) and would ""do anything"" for a 29 year old military pilot she met while visiting her mom this summer. 

My brother asked me to talk with her but not reveal that he (I guess we) had snooped. I wasn't sure how to get her to open up so I invited her over for a sleepover and I opened up first by asking her if she wanted to read my old teen diary for the ""cringe"" factor. She did. The stuff I had written down was very similar to hers (I had a massive crush on my swim coach, and loved having my boobs felt up was what I wrote most about). She actually then showed me her diary (which I didn't reveal I read most of). This actually led us to have a nice discussion that these were just her inner thoughts, she would never really try to sleep with an older guy and finally if she ever wanted to get on birth control I would help her out. In my mind it was a great and productive conversation. 

Well being the teenager she is, she went home and was being a little shit to my brother and for whatever reason she revealed that I had shown her my diary and wanted to sleep with our junior swim coach. My brother took this completely the wrong way and called me furious that I had shown her my diary to give her ""permission"" to do the things I did when I was a teen. I tried to explain to him that I was glad to help but he put me in a really rough spot by talking to her while protecting the fact that he snooped so I did the best I could. he said ""no you acted like an fucking asshole"" and hung up on me and won't answer calls.

My boyfriend (23M) and I (23F) are both from LA. We met there and have been dating for just over half a year now. I moved to Toronto, across the continent in Canada, for school just a short while ago.

My boyfriend has this idea that him visiting me is almost like a favour to me. He says that we should split the cost of flights 50/50 when we fly across the continent to see each other, but so far the only thing planned is him coming to see me twice this month.

I am a broke graduate student and he is significantly more well-off than I am. I have expressed before that I was feeling lonely, but I never specifically requested that he come to see me.

Today we had an argument because I said that I didn't want to pay for half his flights (800 USD, half = 400). He told me that was not fair because he was spending ""so much time in transit"" flying across the country (5-10 hours one way, depends how you fly) and that ""the person being visited should front the majority of the costs"". He also labelled me greedy. When I told him that if he cared about me, he would just pay for his flights in full, he called me manipulative.

It's a huge amount of money for me and I don't feel comfortable with this arrangement. I asked a friend and my dad today and they both said this was not a good way to deal with expenses.

280,Asshole,"Hello all. Throwaway b/c I’d rather not have this associated with my main. I have family that lurks on here. 

I (30F) am pregnant with my first child, and it’s a girl!!!!💗💗🎀🎀🎀 I’m so excited to meet her. She’s definitely a bright spot in our lives right now. I also have a large, traditional, very Irish-Catholic family. There’s a lot of reusing names—i.e. one cousin is “Rose Elizabeth” while another is “Elizabeth Rose.” So far, it’s worked without too many snafus and a lot of compromise. 

Here’s where there might be an issue. My uncle and I have a mutual interest in family genealogy, and we’ve been trying to create a family tree via old letters/documents. As I was going through it, I found what I consider to be the perfect name—for these purposes, I’ll say that it’s “Mabel Josephine”, nn Mae. My husband loves it too, and it’s the first name that we’ve agreed on since we found out she was a girl. 

My sister (34F), however, is named Mae Janice. She has a daughter named Mei with her ex-husband as well. When I told her what our plans were, she kind of made a face and said that I needed to choose another nickname. Her reasoning is that there are way too many Mae/Meis in our family already, and that it’s gotten confusing and frustrating. She asked if we would mind using the full name but calling her something else—i.e. ‘Bella.’ I got really mad, and I admit that I said some regrettable things about her family and husband. We aren’t speaking now. 

AITA? I want to use this historically significant name for my daughter, every single part of it. My family is mostly on my side, but the other day our brother suggested that I had been a bit too harsh in how I’ve gone about this, and that it would save everyone a lot of drama and confusion if I just chose another goddamn nickname.

She looks out her window to see when I'll come home and she'll come up to my apartment and complain about something.

By the way, I'm 34m and I live with my partner. She's around 60 and lives with her husband.

The sort of complaints she has are: you were too loud last night/this morning, your TV was too loud, you moved the furniture too loud, you showered too loud, your AC is too loud, we could hear you had people over, we hear your music, we hear you talking, your cat meows all day long, the water you used for your plants dripped on our balcony, the smells of cooking from your apartment are too strong, we can smell cigarette when you smoke on your balcony, and so on and so forth.

I'm not even going to go into the fact that we have 3 cats that don't meow much (we have cameras), that we have succulents that we don't water as often as she complains about water dripping, and that neither of us smokes. The fact is this woman is driving us crazy. For several years now, we would listen to her complaints, apologize and try to keep it down, but a few weeks ago we had some repair work done at our apartment so while my boyfriend was doing the work, I went down there to ask them for some patience and understanding. To my surprise (horror?) I could hear extremely muffled sounds in their apartment. Almost nothing. And he was literally HAMMERING and DRILLING shit upstairs.

I asked him if he was going easy with the hammer/drill, he said no, that it was super loud. So the conclusion was - they can't hear shit. We've been walking on fucking tip toe for fear of disturbing this poor old couple, I listen to music so quietly, I can't even hear it. So we decided to stop living like church mice and behave normally and to ignore them completely. Now when she calls after me, I just keep walking. When she knocks on my door, I don't answer. Same with her husband. And my boyfriend does the same. Last week, she knocked on my door for a straight 10 minutes, shouting ""I know you're in there"" and would only leave when my next door neighbor told her to gtfo or they'll call the police. Yesterday, she waited until 6pm which is when I come home after work, and started shouting from her window at me. There's a kids' playground in front of our building, and everyone could hear her screaming.
