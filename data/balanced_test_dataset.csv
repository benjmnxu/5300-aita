10431,Asshole,"We adopted a dog two weeks ago, she was only 20wk old and is a Cairn terrier mix. Training so far has been going well, she's already starting to like her crate and messes outside 90% of the time. She's lovely with our son, maybe a little too rambunctious (won't stop chasing, licking, etc unless we separate them). This is all good and dandy but she isn't cuddly at all. She cries when held, doesn't like pets, and generally is antisocial.

This isn't our first dog. We had a Yorkie and a Norwich before this one and they were so cuddly, they just would beg for pets and cuddles and would like nothing more than lay beside you. This new dog is just a completely different personality, not what we were lead to believe (we were told she's cuddly).

Would I be the asshole for returning her to the kennel we got her from? We paid a $500 adoption fee and after the fact got her another round of vaccinations and deworming. We paid the $500 but put another $300 or so into her. Even if we didn't get our money back, the issue isn't the money, it's the dog's personality.",102,63,0.68,AITA for returning a dog because she isn't cuddly?,c1qi3h,2019-06-17 17:35:52,YTA,1066,AITA
18766,Not the A-hole,"I'm getting married October next year, and my fiancé and I are paying for everything ourselves.
I'm close with my parents and my mom is very excited about the wedding. We were discussing the guest list when my parents told me not to bother with a few family members, they wouldn't come anyway and told me not to invite an uncle because his wife is horrible. They mentioned an aunt, I said she wouldn't be invited because she caused a scene at my birthday party a few years ago.  They also tried to convince me to invite a cousin I haven't seen in decades. I said ""I don't even know him"", to which their response was ""we do! And  you went to his wedding when you were little""
We moved on, but my dad brought it up again on a phone call saying he would pay for them to attend. I declined, and moved on.

A couple of weeks ago, I called my parents, all fine until my mom brought up the wedding. she wanted to know who was invited, so I said a few names of people she'd know, and told her I'd done the seating plan. She tells me she wants a table. I said she'd obviously be on the top table with me! I'd misunderstood though.. She explained she wanted a whole table for 10 people and they would pay for them. I asked who she wanted, but she wouldn't tell me, I kept asking, she kept refusing to tell me. In the background I could hear my dad saying,""it's not all about you OP"". I was shocked. of course MY wedding is about me and my fiancé! I was furious and hung up. Later mom text ""how about we compromise and they just come to the evening?""

I was still too angry to respond, so she text again the next day telling me there was no need to hang up on her and that she wasn't excited about the wedding anymore and won't bother asking about it again.  I replied saying I was so upset, I wanted her involved but was not happy with her trying to dictate who should be at my wedding, and especially when she wouldn't even tell me who they were! She still hasn't. I want people I love there and not to look back at the photos at a table of strangers.

Mom said she wasn't dictating and she's not arguing about it anymore.

I love my parents and falling out with them like this doesn't happen so a few days later I text to say I was devastated that we weren't talking, that I wanted them involved and if it meant that much to them, these people could come to the evening. We reconciled over text and haven't spoken about the wedding since. We have spoken on the phone and texts several times but the thing is, I can't get over this.

I don't really want to speak to them at the moment and feel like this is hanging over my head and will ultimately cause more agro in the future when it comes up again so I'm struggling to forget about it.  They are not used to me saying no to them and standing firm with it, but it is my wedding and my fiancé and I should have final say.

Any advice would be appreciated!",175,449,0.94,AITA for not letting my parents invite people to my wedding,g5g8wp,2020-04-21 14:30:57,NTA,2897,AITA
14989,Not the A-hole,"I go to school that guarantees housing. However, my current roommate's inability to compromise and empathize has driven me out of my dorm that I am paying for, and instead, live with my very-understanding bf whose apartment is an hour away from school. However, the commute is nothing compared to having to live in the dorm and I've even come to enjoy it, so having to move out 6 months prematurely is not even my primary concern.

The first red flag was on move-in day when I asked about her shower schedule and she shrugged and said, ""Oh, you know, whenever I remember to."" I didn't think much of it but as this year has progressed, I have never once seen her go into the bathroom and hear water running, come out with wet hair, or wash her bed sheets. The BO is more noticeable when she's in the room so I try to go there when she's not.

She also has a habit of bringing food into the room and letting it sit for months (there's a bowl of squash that has been sitting there since winter). I bought our mini-fridge at her request and I hardly ever use it. She lets food go bad in there and when I ask her to eat it faster, she tells me she'll ""eat it at whatever pace I want."" The pinnacle of this was me throwing out her spoiled food in December as she had already left for winter break and her yelling at me over text about it.

Another side-note: she keeps an empty bottle of parmesan cheese in her bed. She tucks the thing in like it's her child and one time, I saw it on the ground and said, ""You dropped something"" and she scrambled out of bed to grab it and tucked it back in.

For anyone who thinks I should go to my RA, I don't because my RA is the most antisocial guy I've ever met. He's nice but his entire vibe tells me he wants to interact with other people as little as possible and I'd also like to interact with my roommate as little as possible which would not happen if he had us talk things out.

This morning, after a bad night's sleep, I went back to my room to see if I could nap but she was there. The godawful smell hit me like a freight train. I couldn't be in the room without feeling like I was going to vomit. I asked a friend to come over and he agreed with me, saying ""It's not even something words can describe."" Later, I texted her asking her to shower and she told me, verbatim, to ""fuck right off"".

Even though I can't stand her, I've tried keeping things civil and she basically has had a single room this whole year. But I feel like it's gone too far. My bf suggested we take the mini-fridge back to his place as we could actually use it, but she seems mentally unstable frankly, and I'm worried she would go off at me and that it's too extreme.

18869,Not the A-hole,"Backstory:My mom died when I was like 4 and my dad remarried when I was 6. My step mom is alright and I don't have any problems with her. She had 3 kids from a previous marriage, an 18yo girl 17yo boy and 15yo girl, I am 18 so I'm the same age as the oldest, but I'm older by a couple months. At first when we all moved it I was happy to have siblings, but the feeling wasn't mutual at all and they excluded me a lot from things. Saying that I'm ""not one of them"" and other crap like that. Me and the 17yo fought A LOT like almost daily, nothing too bad just dumb kid stuff. Our parents nipped that in the bud but arguments with him were daily till i was like 13 and just gave up. The 18yo HATES me, cause of me and her brother fighting a lot and same with the 15yo. My dad and step mom tried to make us all one blended family but it just didn't work, I was open to it but they were intent on just blocking me out. Around 12 I just stopped trying and did my own thing, I have absolutely 0 relationship or attachment with any of them.  

Main problem:  I was away at a friends house and I forgot to lock the door to my room.  My step siblings have had a problem with going into my room cause I keep my stuff organized and I’m the only one with a tv in my room (I paid for it). And they watch tv, I usually just let them to avoid talking to them.   I have a mini memorial of my mom in my room that has a plaque of my mom and her urn.  It’s not much but I like it, I guess all 3 were watching tv and somehow my urn got knocked over.........a lot of the ash is now in my carpet and now it’s basically just an empty thing.  When I got home I flipped my shit, it got bad enough that my dad came into my room and sent them out.  When I told him what happened he said that he’s sorry and that he will talk to him.  (This is where I may be the AH) my dad said something about never being too mad at “family”.  I had enough and told him exactly this “they aren’t my family, they have made home life shit for years and now knocked over the ashes of my mom.  I fucking HATE them.”  He went quiet and didn’t say anything and just left my room. 

My step siblings haven’t apologized (not that I’d accept anything they say). I feel bad what I said to my dad but I don’t regret a word of what I said.  AITA?

Edit: thanks for the awards!!! 

Edit 2: when I was 7 I did something really stupid and put the plastic bag out and poured the ashes straight into the urn.  I regretted once I did it but I was a dumb 7yo.  And the urn has a chip in the ring so it never screwed on right and was wobbly",1807,21847,0.96,AITA for telling my dad I hate my step siblings after they knocked over my dead mom’s urn?,f6xtoi,2020-02-20 19:01:15,NTA,2577,AITA
11488,Not the A-hole,"She has a kid, he is visiting for a few weeks. They were going swimming. I havent seen her in over a two weeks with minimal texting. 
  She says shes just busy and cant make time for me. Sure, I get it. So I dont text. 
  Anyway, after not speaking she texts me yesterday and says her son hasn't wanted to see anyone. But I could buy them dinner as she ran out if her savings she had for him in the first week of him being here. 
  I thought she just wanted to be fed, so I backed off. Someone else bought her a Pizza. 
  She invited me over after, I accepted. Thinking maybe it wasn't just cash she wanted. 
 I ended up playing table tennis with her son and after about 40 minutes, told her I was going to head home. 
  She was surprised, but the entire time she was on the phone texting someone while I basically babysat her son. 
  After that I saw a black pair of flip flops. The tags were still on them. Size 11-12 sitting next to a pink pair that were easily for an adult. They had designs on them. Finally there were a smaller set, in superman blue. I figured those must be the sons. The pink were hers, and the black pair were for... idk who. So I asked her about it  
  She immediately got mad and asked me, ""I can't have black flip flops?"" I said that it was valid to have them, but what would they be for since there was a pink pair that was more her style. 
 She then said she needed them for yard work. 
  I thought that might be tough, yard work in flip flops. But by then she had said she just wants to spend time with her son. 
  I did get upset at her dismissal.  I told her that our relationship is clearly a chore to her, judging from her posture.  
   I went to leave and she said I was crazy for asking about the flip flops. Called me Insane. So I looked her dead in the face and asked her if this is what she was going to stick with.. that I was Insane for asking if there was someone those flip flops belonged to and not believing she needed black size 12 flip flops for yard work. 
  I then left and she slammed the door and locked it. While I asked her this, her son ran in the room. 

I really like this girl, it sounds like she isnt interested. Or treats me like i don't matter. Am I an asshole for asking about another guy?

12348,Not the A-hole,"So my husband and I were stuck in an airport for 15 hours yesterday due to multiple flights to our destination being delayed and cancelled, so we hung out at a lot of different charging stations. 





This lady had her phone on top of someone else’s phone in her group on the charging station. Apparently she had set an alarm thing on her phone to go off if someone moves it because she left it unattended on the charging station. 





When we got to the charging station at our terminal the alarm was going off already and apparently the lady had walked away to do something and someone else in her group was holding it and the alarm was just constantly going off and sounded like a car alarm. Me and my husband were trying to figure out what was making this noise. 






So when she comes back from the bathroom, she’s yelling at her husband “wtf why is my phone going off?! Who touched it?!?!” 





So she looks over at me and my husband with the nastiest face assuming we fucked with her phone, which we did not. I do not care to mess with other people’s stuff. She was just yelling and going on and on about someone touching her phone, very loudly and angrily. For a good solid 10 minutes, constantly bitching. 





Her husband tells her someone bumped it while trying to get their phone plugged in to this station. And she just gets even madder still yelling about people trying to take her shit, which nobody did. 





So she comes to the station, moves other people’s shit around to get her phone plugged back in and she puts that damn car alarm trigger back on it, so if it moves, it goes off very loudly. 





When it’s time to start boarding she’s waiting at the desk, even though she was in the last boarding group. She was in such a hurry to try to cut every other boarding group, I guess she forgot about her heavily secured phone on the charging station. 





Her husband tells her, this isn’t our group you can’t board and she just shrugs her shoulders and stays in the line. My husband and I are still by the charging station because our boarding group was next to last. I unplug my phone and notice hers is still plugged in. She’s near the front of the line at this point. 






So I’m not touching that thing to make it go off very loudly again and have her accuse me of stealing her shit, yet again, just to take it to her and line cutting husband. She was complaining very loudly about god knows what to the people at the boarding gate so I just decided to leave it, thinking maybe she’d remember but I honestly don’t know if she ever did. 





Does this make me an asshole?

6492,No A-holes here,"My sister moved out 2 months ago but is visiting right now so it wont be an issue again. But I’m curious about whether I’m justified in feeling like she is TA here. I stream on twitch as a part time job, it makes me some money and I don’t make a lot of money at my regular job. I also consider it a huge passion and hobby off mine. Back when she lived here, she lived on a floor above me in our house and always claimed she could hear me stream late into the night. 

She’d bang on my door during streams, send me aggressive texts, and even stomp on the floor above. It was embarrassing to have my viewers witness it so I would always log off my streams early and eventually I gave up streaming. Take in mind my sister has supersonic hearing and she freaks out at the sound of a bathroom DOOR lightly clicking shut at nighttime and gets up and causes a scene about small noises all the time. For example weekend when everyone was up at 11 am having breakfast on the kitchen shed be screaming from her room that she’s trying to sleep. 

When she moved out I finally got a chance to get back into it. However because of her wedding festivities and other family visiting I didn’t get to this summer. This week I finally got to stream again. I work full time so weekends are my only days to stream. I streamed last night for the first time in FOREVER and it was an amazing stream. I requested beforehand to my sister that if she needed me to lower my voice she could text me and I’d go as low as I could, but that I am streaming and that’s that. She said fine. 

I had a good stream with tons of hosts, raids, new followers and subscribers. Really really good for my twitch to grow. I was having a blast for ONCE doing something I loved. It was a 10 pm to 2 am stream. People who go on twitch know that streams are on average 3-5 hour. 

But, she didn’t listen to my request and kept aggressively texting me many times throughout the night to lower my volume and to just stop streaming. She knocked on my door hella hard at one point so I had to mute my stream for a while. the  later she stomped super hard on the floor above a BUNCH of times.  

Finally I texted her “I’m getting off stream, happy? Don’t be a psycho. This is my house, not yours.” 

I feel mean for calling it my house not hers bc she moved out of state and I know she misses being here a lot too. But shes leaving in 2 days and has her own apartment to be quiet and comfortable in forever. She can’t accommodate for ONE night on a Saturday for my hobby? *I* live here. Its *my* weekend when she doesn’t even work! And my parents and other sister literally DO NOT hear my voice or get bothered by it even though their rooms are just as close. The game volume is in my headset. There is only the noise of my voice.

8631,No A-holes here,"I'm going to word this one in a very frank way without trying to make myself sound better or anything:

My girlfriend and I just bought our first house in a quiet neighborhood where the houses are very close together and most of the people living there don't seem to mind it at all. We made a point so say hello to all of our new neighbors and build a friendly rapport - this is our first house and we really want to be good neighbors.

Our neighbors on both sides turned out to be really nice! We get along well and talk often. They both offer to help us move and give us advice and tips for places to eat around here - all that stuff. Offer to have us over for BBQs. They're nice people. 

Anyways, the fences on both sides of our backyard are very short, about 4 feet tall. During one of our conversations, one of the neighbors mentioned that she was offended, maybe even a little mad, that the person the other side of her backyard put up a taller privacy fence. Here's the thing: I like our neighbors, but they are always in their backyards. I just want to be able to hang out in peace without having to act a certain way and say hello and talk to my neighbors for 15 minutes every time I go out there. I want our backyard to be a private space for us to hang out and do our thing. Maybe I wanna act a little weird without being self conscious. 

That said, I want to plant lots of bushes and trees along the outside of the backyard to get some privacy. I believe I'm the first person to do this.

9466,Not the A-hole,"This happened just over a week ago, and my parents and girlfriend said that I took things a bit over the top. I(24M) was out for dinner with my girlfriend and parents at a higher  restaurant in the east coast. After we finished our dinner, we were making a short walk to my car a few hundred feet away. As this was in a downtown area, its fairly common for folks to set up stalls for charities, girls scout cookies, etc. There was a stall for an anti-drug abuse organization (rhymes with stare) that focused on keeping school kids away from drugs/substance abuse.  With this being a high traffic area of rather affluent individuals ( high end shops, restaurants, etc.), there was a decent amount of people donating, and feeling charitable, I stood in line to donate as well. I typically only carry around a money-clip with cash and leave my wallet in my car. My turn came up, and I told them I wanted to donate $250(A big amount imo that was still in my affordable limits). For some reason, I decided that I wanted to actually put it on my credit card ( for a record in addition to the receipt they provide) instead. My car was parked diagonal to the stall, and I went and grabbed my wallet real quick. Now, I went back and handed my credit card, and cue them complimenting me on such a nice car. Then, they asked me if $250 was the best I could do, and that with a car like that I should be able to ""add a grand or two to that amount"". I was honestly taken aback, but brushed it off as being a joke and politely said nah. Then they started negotiating the damn amount. First insisting on me to atleast double it to $500, etc. I was livid to say the least. I was in no way obligated to donate, and now they were acting so entitled and basically attempting to extort donations. I raised my voice  told them to give me my card back and that I would not be donating to their organization through them. The folks in line to donate after me were also surprised by this display of entitlement, and acknowledged my reaction as being appropriate. A good 4-5 people walked away. At this point, I was stopped for further asking to speak with their higher ups to raise a complaint by my girlfriend and parents, but was I actually the asshole in this situation?

4059,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory sorry for mobile 

A few months ago one of my best friends confessed to a guy she liked. She'd had a crush on him for months and finally did it at the end of her Freshman year. He rejected her with the classic ""it's not you it's me"" bull and left her devastated for next month.

Fast forward to now, a long time after that all happened, and he starts flirting with her. She lost interest in him a long time ago, but he kept messaging her and bothering her so much until he eventually gave in. A bad call, but she ended up giving in and got into a relationship with him.

I lost alot of my respect for this guy in the past year. He barely gave two shits when he rejected her and a little while after he did he tried hooking up with another one of my friends.

Last night she received a message from him that left a really bad taste in my mouth. He told her that ""he wanted to keep talking to her"" and to ""tell him whenever her parents aren't home so he can come"". I lost all respect for him after this. Its obvious he just wants to have sex with her, and he's a complete scumbag about it. 

It really isn't by business to barge into, but as her friend I feel like i need to talk to her and make her consider her actions.

7097,Not the A-hole,"My mother-in-law has a terrible habit of interrupting and talking over people. For example, when she was driving to our house she got lost, despite having a GPS so she called for help. Every time we tried to give her directions she would talk over us, complaining loudly about technology, other drivers, how tired she was, etc. She spent so much time talking over us, she ended up missing several turns and it took me repeating ""I can't help you if you won't listen"" several times before she stopped talking long enough to get instructions.

My son (11) has been frustrated with her tendency to talk over him. He has ADHD and struggles to get sentences out and when he gets interrupted it is hard for him to pick up what he was saying. However, he wants to be heard just like anyone else.

He used to just go silent when she would talk over him, but he got annoyed enough that he started asserting himself. Now when she does it he says ""Please stop interrupting me."" and ""I was still talking, please let me finish.""

He does say please, and he doesn't raise his voice, but he definitely has an angry tone when he says it. Every time he does this she huffs and looks at me like ""you need to do something.""

My knee-jerk response is to scold him for using that tone with his grandmother, but at the same time, I think he's justified in demanding a little courtesy. I haven't scolded him.

AITA?

Edit: Based on the advice here I had a talk with my son. I told him I was proud of him for standing up for himself and that it is ok for him to ask to not be interrupted. I also said that it is possible to be kind and firm at the same time, and as long as he continued to use polite words and tried to use a kinder tone I would support him.

I didn't put it in my original post, but when she was interrupting him, it wasn't when he was trying to talk to her. We were in a car and he was trying to tell me something and she kept talking over him to say something unrelated. So, I also had a conversation with my MIL when my son was not around. I explained how his ADHD makes it harder for him to pick up the thread of a thought than it is for other people and that I want to hear what he has to say since he already has such a hard time expressing himself.

She responded by saying that he shouldn't interrupt an adult and he needs to learn to be more respectful. It's the same litany that was hammered into my head when I was a kid, hence my knee-jerk instinct to scold. But, despite my indoctrination I actually think that everyone should be treated with consideration, regardless of age. I said as much to her. It did not go over well.

The first two years were incredibly smooth, he helped around the house with chores, went to therapy, paid some utilities,(didn't need to but he insisted) helped watched my kids, (wife and I managed to do things we thought we couldn't do often because of this) and my 3 kids adored their uncle. (they loved when he brought their cousin over.)

 This changed over the past year, when he lost his rights to equal visitation with his son. His ex-wife managed to made up some BS, that the judge fell for(the system is totally fair). This sent him into even deeper depression, because he absolutely loved his son.  He took an leave of absence from work, and I was completely supportive of him. He started to fall victim to the bottle and I caught him passed out drunk a few times. (thankfully, never when my kids were around)  I offered to pay for him to go to rehab center. He said he would take up the offer and never did.  He didn't go back to work either, and I found out later he quit his job. He started to become lazy around the house.   At first, I tolerated it, but he refused to change his habits nor seek help.  This reached a breaking point, this Saturday, when I caught him passed out drunk while my kids were home.  They were sleeping, but it was completely unacceptable.  

I didn't say anything to him at all about it.   After consulting my parents, wife, and other siblings, I decided to kick him out.  

I confronted him yesterday, and had all of his stuff packed up. I told him he couldn't live here anymore and that he had to leave.  He burst into tears and got angry at me. He told me I was stabbing him in the back too.  

I stayed calm and told him he would be welcome back in open arms if he truly wanted to change and that the moment you put my children in any type of trouble was the limit. He left angry and has since stayed with a friend.  

I was on the verge of tears, the entire time, but I felt like I needed to do this.  I have never had to cut any of my family out of my life like this before. 

When my wife came home with my children from school and they asked where their uncle was, I broke down and cried.

13219,Not the A-hole,"I recently joined a 24 hour gym. Members can access the gym any time, but owners and employees are rarely there. Most people who go there are great, but today when I went there was a woman there who brought her horde of children with her. They ranged in age from young teens to 8 or 9, and spent the entire time running around, messing with the equipment, and being loud. 

While the noise might just be something I should expect to deal with at a gym, the other issues are more serious. The gym has a rule that you have to wipe down equipment when you’re done using it, and also replace any weights you use, which the children did not do. The children were also literally running around equipment that was actively being used, which is dangerous. 

WIBTA if I reported the woman if this happens again? The gym has security cameras and a system that tracks your keycard’s uses, so there would be no issue with the owners figuring out who she is and verifying what I tell them.

20323,Not the A-hole,"My (25M) girlfriend (25F) of a year and a half just moved into my apartment two or three weeks ago.

She usually orders takeout, but last night she decided she wanted to start cooking for herself. 

I walk into the kitchen and see she has a piece of raw chicken in the sink, so I ask her not to do that since it'll get bacteria on the sink and anything else that goes in there. Instead of taking it out and using the bowl I sat next to her, she picks it up and turns on the faucet trying to wash it, as I saw my life flashing before my eyes, splashing water all over the place, and I say you're not supposed to wash chicken because it spreads bacteria, as she says ""what bacteria?"". She then takes one hand off of the chicken and uses it to turn off the faucet, the whole time I'm saying she could have gotten salmonella all over the sink/counter/faucet as she takes the chicken to my cutting board table I use to cut fruit, places the chicken down, and walks over to the fridge (without washing her hands), opens it with her still wet hand, as she starts rummaging through the fruit/vegi drawer.  I tell her she's going to have to wash the handle now and any think else she touched because that could become a breeding ground for bacteria as she yells ""stop pissing me off and just leave me alone, I guarantee you any chicken you've eating at a restaurant was made the same way "". So I did. 

I went to the bedroom and an hour later I hear her eating and talking on facetime when she tells the person how ""I went psycho over some f\*cking chicken"", ""followed her around telling her how to cook her own dinner"" and how I ""need a reality check"".

I feel like ass for bringing it up since she was only trying to cook herself dinner, and I'm not generally a germaphobe, but this is just one of those things.

14813,Not the A-hole,"My mother in law is a bit of a “spoiler” with our 5 year old son. She tends to go overboard with gifts for him. He’s her only grandson, so I kind of get it...HOWEVER. 

Last Christmas, my mother in law asked me about getting a big backyard toy for our son. I told her to talk to my husband about it. A few days later she was ordering our son the big outdoor toy, and so I figured she’d talked to my husband about it.

Well, she didn’t. My husband didn’t know about it until I brought it up the day it was being delivered. I don’t know if she did this on purpose, or if she thought that they had talked about it or what. It actually turned out OK, but it was maddening at the time. 

Our sons birthday was recently, and she specifically asked what kinds of toys to get him. Our “rules” were simple, or at least we thought. Toys that were “sturdy,” that had one (or at most 2 pieces) and that didn’t make noise. 

Our son has Autism and doesn’t comprehend some things, and once he’s been given a gift a certain way, it HAS to stay that way until it’s modified by him or else he has a meltdown. NOT A TANTRUM. 

When we went to celebrate, she got him a LOUD vehicle that does not stop unless you turn off the whole thing (and our son knows how to use on and off switches, plus there’s no volume), a bag of little cars (small and cheaply made, that will all be lost in a week) and a set of little signs and vehicle cones as accessories for the cars. 

Now, I’m NOT UNGRATEFUL, even though I sound like I am, but I’ve had to take the batteries out of the vehicle, and give him only one or two cars. My son doesn’t understand why he can’t have ALL of his toys NOW.  He doesn’t understand why the vehicle “doesn’t work anymore” and wants me to fix it. 

I hate that I’m put in this situation when we put parameters in place so this doesn’t happen, and she ignores them. 

AITA for wanting to inspect the toys, or ask for a list of what she’s going to buy him before she does, and if she doesn’t abide by our “rules” she’s not allowed to give him ANY toys??  

I know this may be excessive, and I MBTA but she doesn’t have to deal with these toys that she gives us. She doesn’t have to deal with him being mad and having a meltdown because if I hear that vehicle one more time, I’m going to break it in half myself!!  

EDIT-She also joked about the toys after giving them to him, but I don’t know if that was out of embarrassment or because she thought it was funny.  I’d say it was out of embarrassment, but she had just talked to my husband about what was acceptable the day she bought the presents. 

SECOND EDIT-Comment I made below “For the record, my husband thinks YTA (meaning IMTA). 

Even though my husband is upset about this as well, he thinks that if it gets to the point where we end up telling her she CAN’T get him toys as gifts, that she will anyway and find a way to get them to him when she babysits or some other situation (like giving him a gift in a crowded restaurant). 

I told him that if that’s the case, then she can’t see him alone, and we will stop dining out with the. He thinks that’s too excessive. I think that a boundary has to be set with her, and this is the only way to get it through to her.

14364,No A-holes here,"My husband (32m) and I (30f) had decided to try to get pregnant this summer. I’ve always been pretty on the fence as to if I wanted children or not and in the earlier parts of our relationship (we’ve been together 10 years, married 4) my husband also said he could go either way. In the last couple years, after seeing most of our close friends become parents, my husband came to the decision that he does really want kids. He never pressured me and understood I may decide I didn’t want them and always said he’d be ok if that were the case. 

In the last few years a lot of great things have fallen in place for us. We bought a beautiful house, he was promoted to CFO at his job and now makes really good money, I found a teaching job in the district I had always really wanted to be in (I spent the first 5 years of my teaching career being laid off or bounced between schools). I decided that I was really comfortable with where things were and I was ready to start thinking about getting pregnant and starting a family. I told my husband and he was elated. We decided this summer would be a good time to begin trying. I talked with my OBGYN, began taking prenatal vitamins, and everything was good. 

Then a couple weeks ago, I got a lay-off notice from my job. There’s a huge budget deficit this year due to state aid not coming through, and the outcome looks pretty bleak. I’ve been here for four years and honestly felt blindsided by it because we haven’t had any budget issues in the years I’ve been here. I’m still contracted through the end of this school year but that’s it. There is a definite chance I could be called back before next school year, but also a chance I may not. 

I told my husband I no longer want to try to get pregnant this summer because of this. He feels like this is really unfair and I’m letting a situation out of our control dictate the future of our family. I told him I’m incredibly stressed at the idea of losing my job (I love my district, coworkers, curriculum, etc) and that it’s devastating to think about not being there next year. I don’t want the added stress of trying to get pregnant or being pregnant with so much uncertainty. Also, I’m very close with my current coworkers, and the thought of not having them as a support during a pregnancy is really scary. He argues that his job is very secure and that he makes enough money to support us (and potential children) without me needing to work. He also says we have his family and coworkers as support systems throughout a pregnancy and after childbirth.

We’ve talked about it a lot over the last week and he ascertains my decision is unreasonable and is very upset. He also feels like he has little say in the matter, that I’m making this decision without him, and that’s frustrating him. I’ve stuck by my stance that I’m uncomfortable starting a family unless my current job calls me back.

One thing that does scare me to death is her going to work, riding the bus, and coming back home all alone. This is something she really wants to do and the therapist told me to supporting her would be the best option right now and I do.

She is profoundly deaf, diagnosed at birth. I am a sign language interpreter and my husband is also deaf. We have been teaching her basic BSL (British Sign Language) and she's picked it up so fast. My friend is also willing to learn, but his wife is less so. She believes we should be teaching L to lip read so she'll 'present as hearing'. I've tried to explain that she'll never present as hearing, as she will never speak clearly because she can't hear her own voice.


L has started going to preschool over the last month. It's clear she struggles, and the preschool don't have a interpreter to help. I asked how she likes school and she said noone talks to her, not even the teachers.


For this reason, I put forward the idea of her going to a deaf school that my husband went to. It's about 40 minutes away by car, transport can be arranged and she would be able to be with others like her and be able to communicate.


Again, my friend was open to it, but his wife wasn't. She thinks the school is too far, and thinks L should be mainstream schooled to get her used to dealing with hearing people. It's caused a big row, and I'm now banned from coming over to see L.

I chose to take my dogs with me because they were always MY dogs, i took care of them, fed them, trained them. Moreover, they ***feel*** mine. They love me more than anyone in my family, follow me even to the bathroom. They are super well behaved but also I have to admit they are very possessive of me, wanting to hug all the time (as in lay against me while they sleep) 2 of them are super small, one is medium sized, all mutts.

My bf wasnt excited to live with them but he wasnt against it either.

But now he is, 4 months into our living together he told me an ultimatum - either I send the dogs to my parents/shelter/new owner or he leaves. 

As arguments he presented that they have to sleep in our bedroom ( they do, but they don't sleep on the bed, they have their own small dog beds) so he cant focus while having sex, they are always near me, that they lick me and I kiss their foreheads - both of which he finds disgusting - and that out flat is too small anyway to have 3 dogs in it. When i said he had no problem before we moved in, he claimed he thought i will come to my senses already and ""besides, you wouldnt move in if I told you to leave your dogs and I love you too much to live away from you""

I was heartbroken but when he said he will leave if I dont get rid of the dogs, I packed my stuff and moved to my friend's flat. She was looking for a roommate anyway (thankfully) and accepted the dogs. 

I thought we were over, cried my heart out for a week and now after 2 weeks he called me and said he ""made a mistake"" but that he was hurt I loved dogs more than him.

5792,No A-holes here,"My dad passed away shortly before I \[now 30M\] was born. My mom, who kept her maiden name, gave me my dad's last name ""to carry on his legacy"". The next bit will sound harsh but it's important. Mom almost never talks about dad and when she does, there's no hint of sadness, only fondness. She's not 'actively mourning' if that makes sense.

In March I proposed to my gf \[32F\] and she said yes. Yay! Soon after, we discussed whose last name we would take, because we both wanted to have the same last name as each other and our future kids. My fiancee is in a niche career where name recognition is very important (being vague for anonymity). I've been with the same company for years and plan to stay here, so I felt like it would be easier for my name to change. After discussing it a bit, we decided to both take her last name. It helped that I only share my last name with a bunch of distant relatives, while she has many siblings and cousins with the same last name.

We didn't make an announcement about this, not seeing it as a big deal, and only told people who expressly asked. Lots of people did actually ask, because in her field this is a common issue (eg, her family found out early because one of her bridesmaids asked at a dress fitting in front of her mom and sister.) My mom never asked and we never raised it.

Well, I don't know who, but someone told my mom last weekend at a party we were hosting. Mom came up to me almost in tears and asked if it's true that I'm changing my name. I took her aside and said yeah, and explained why. She said some surprising things - that this is a betrayal to my dad and to her,  it's like I'm completely turning my back on my family, and she couldn't believe I would ""throw away"" the name that's meant to honor my dead father. I tried to explain that's not how i see it at all and I didn't realize she was still in such pain over my dad, but she wasn't having any of it. She asked why we didn't discuss it with her and I said, truthfully, because we had already discussed it with each other and made up our minds. This did not go down well and she left the party in tears. I've tried to call her since but she texted me to say she needs some time.

My fiancee and I have been discussing this a lot. We both don't think that we're TA for taking her name (but welcome any judgements). However she thinks that maybe we were TA for not discussing it with my mom first and letting her find out this way. Knowing now how she feels about it, I do wish we'd spoken to her privately, I guess I just really didn't think she'd be upset. However I remain firm that we didn't need to discuss it with her. We had discussed all of the options with each other and it would have been disingenuous to ask for her input when we weren't going to change our minds no matter what she said.

We bought her a crib ($1200) and some baby clothes (about $200) in preparation. She also received other gifts from other family members.

20171,Not the A-hole,"So I am (33F).

When I was 25, I officially applied to the adoption register. I knew really early on I wanted kids but I don’t have a successful love life so adoption seemed the best case for me. I also wanted to able to provide for a kid in the care system. I thought I’d get rejected because of my age but I found out I was okay as I was over 21 and I met pretty much all the requirements.

I knew I’d have a long wait to begin with getting checks and stuff done and even potentially getting matched with a kid. I was open minded and due to my age I was willing to adopt a child aged between 0-5. I didn’t get a match for a really long time and I did when I was 27. He was a beautiful little 15 month old and I even got close to adopting him, but we unfortunately weren’t meant to be. He clicked better with a couple and I accepted it. I had a few more chances but we weren’t good fits and as I hit my 30s I reallt thought it wouldn’t happen.

Then, I got matched with Lola (fake name) when I was 31. She was 2, came from an abusive background and we got along really well. I opened up my home to her and fostered her for over a year. . She seemed to work really great with me and I started proceedings to adopt her which took a couple of months  and it became official only a couple of weeks ago!  

Now, I didn’t tell anybody I’d tried to adopt for eight years except for my immediate family. I didn’t know how it would work out especially even with things going great with Lola. I only told my boss about the adoption as it sometimes interfered with my work and he was really understanding. I didn’t mention it to my coworkers as I didn’t want to get my hopes up in case Lola ended up going back into care.

Anyway, I’ve worked at my current job a good few years with the same people. I’m still going in as lockdown restrictions have been eased and I finally told them that I was officially a mom. They had some generic questions and I said Lola was 4 and beautiful and I was really psyched and one of them got really bitchy. She said it was a really shady thing to hide the fact Lola has been living with me for at least 2 years almost and that I’m an AH for hiding my daughters existence.

I never hid her, I just told my family and boss as I didn’t know how well things would be and I didn’t want Lola getting spooked by a bunch of strangers she doesn’t know. Maybe I could have been a bit more open about my adoption struggles but I’ve waited so long to be a mom and had so much disappointment that I didn’t want to say anything until I was one for sure.

AITA?

Update; I kept her identity a secret purely for safeguarding. I won’t go into details but she was really affected by her abusive household and was scared to be around anyone but me for a long time so introducing her to strangers was not the best option. I also didn’t know if fostering her would lead to adoption.",587,6719,0.97,AITA for not telling my coworkers I had applied for adoption until I actually adopted my child?,gnc0nc,2020-05-20 14:10:32,NTA,2885,AITA
19333,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I are planning to go out of town for 5 days to take a camping trip at a national park that is not dog-friendly. I brought up that I would like my coworker to come stay at our house for the 5 days we are gone. She is someone I trust very much as she was previously a vet tech, and is generally a reliable and trustworthy person.

My husband does not want a ‘stranger’ staying in our home, and instead wants to leave our two dogs with his parents. One of the dogs I owned before coming into the relationship the other is a dog we got after we moved into our current home. We once left my own dog with his parents for a week while we went on vacation, and after explaining to them that they could not leave my dog in their back yard unattended(they had a large gap in their fencing(roughly 2 feet) that was covered by a piece of plywood that could easily be pushed away, they left my dog in the yard unattended and she pushed over the plywood and escaped. They called me and explained they had left her outside and she had went missing, with no real idea of how long she had been gone. I later got a call from one of their neighbors that they had found my dog and wanted me to pick it up, so my in-laws picked my dog up and it didn’t escape anymore. I later found out that my in-laws left my dog outside because they thought I was “exaggerating” because she is a very mild mannered well behaved dog and they didn’t believe she would try to push the unsecured plywood away. When my dog is bored or left unattended she gets anxious so while she does fine in the yard with people around she gets antsy and has dug under fences in the past, I told my in-laws this to make sure she wasn’t left alone.

I’m thankful my dog was found but they live very close to a busy highway and it could have easily ended very differently. I told my husband I don’t want his parents keeping our dogs at their house, and we got into a very heated argument because he thought it was mean to choose a coworker over family. I think my stance is pretty reasonable, we gave his parents a shot with my dog and while I have no doubt they love my dog and it wasn’t intentional, they disregarded my warning that she shouldn’t be left alone outside and my dog could have been gone forever or hit by a car etc. 

My husband is telling me his mother will be hurt/upset if we let someone else watch the dogs, so I offered to board them at a professional facility and he’s said that’s even worse because in his words “it’s like you don’t trust my parents.” And the truth is, when it comes to taking care of our dogs, I don’t based on the past experience.

AITA for not wanting his parents to watch our dogs after they lost mine previously? I love his parents and he has been guilting me for nearly a week telling me his mom already asked if we would leave the dogs with them etc. I told him to tell her we already made arrangements but I  have since found out he’s told her we probably would drop them off when we go out of town.",195,1081,0.96,AITA for not wanting my in-laws to watch our dogs while on vacation after they previously lost one?,haqlbc,2020-06-17 12:57:02,NTA,3005,AITA

So yesterday I had the apartment to myself, and decided to masturbate. Don’t judge, we all do it, lol. Anyway, my roommate came home during, and was with a mutual friend of ours. This mutual friend and I are really close, and hang out all the time, so when they arrived, she opened the door to my room to come in and say hi. Now, my door was closed, but wasn’t locked, because I was home alone. She unfortunately walked in on me doing my thing, looked horrified, and left the room. Of course, I was super embarrassed.

Later, she asked me for an apology for making her see that. I said that it sucks that she had to see me masturbating, but I didn’t feel the need to apologize, because I didn’t do anything wrong, she was the one who walked into my room without knocking. Her response was that we have a close relationship, and go into each other’s rooms without knocking all the time, so she assumed it was fine - which is true, but obviously in this case our closeness led to an awkward situation. 

I’m usually the type to suck it up and apologize even if I feel I did nothing wrong, but I didn’t want to for this because I felt uncomfortable with her seeing me jerking off, so the idea of me apologizing for being walked in on masturbating makes no sense to me. She’s not “end the friendship” pissed, but she is still mad that I won’t apologize to her.

4028,Asshole,"I was at a grocery store over the weekend that had massive sales. It’s a moderate size grocery store that I believe is a regional chain. There were no spaces in the parking lot and carts were very far and few between. 

As I was walking into the store, there was a lone cart that someone just left. I sped up to it, and rested my hand on the handle. I always like to clean it with a disinfecting wipe that the store has a dispenser of, so I turned my back and walked about 5 feet from my cart to get a wipe. When I turn around, a man in his 50s sniped my cart. As a note, I am a man in my 30s. 

I saw it happen and said excuse me sir that was my cart. He said “there was no one here when I got here so it’s mine actually” and shrugged and walked away. I was extremely annoyed because there was no carts. I also anticipated a large order so I needed a cart and a basket would not be sufficient 

I decided to follow the man around the store. He began to put items in the cart. When he got to an aisle, he turned his back, walked about 20 feet away to look at something. I saw this as an opportunity.. he had maybe 5 items in the cart, all small food items. I took the cart and began to walk backwards. He turned around and began screaming at me. I stared at him and continued walking backwards. Then, I gently took his items out and put them on the shelf. He began to yell and said it was his cart. I responded, just as he had to me, that “there was no one here when I got here actually, it is actually mine now”. 

He lost it. I ignored him and began shopping. I calmly got my meats and he was berating me. A few customers noticed and the manager came out. He took both our statements and ended up getting a cart that he found in the parking lot and brought it to the man.

To get in to it, I am by far the youngest of 4 siblings, my 2 brothers and my sister all have kids by now, meanwhile I still live at home and am deciding what I want to study and I also work at our local grocery store, but at the end of the day, I have way more free time than my parents or siblings.

So of course the sibs ask me to babysit their kids quite a bit while they work and usually I am okay with it and they never make a fuss when I decline. Usually I enjoy doing it though, all the kids see me as their cool uncle so they are always in great moods when here, apart from one Nephew, he is 9 and has been diagnosed with a mild form of autism and ADHD and he is always a handful and that is a nice way of putting it. Throwing massive tantrums whem he doesn't get his way, being extremely cruel and mean to his sister and his other niece and nephews, knocking stuff over, cursing and yelling at me and sometimes straight up screaming when I take them for walks or to the play areas in the neighbourhood those are just a few of the many examples but I hope it paints the picture. I just didn't enjoy babysitting the kids anymore as a result.

I confronted my brother and his wife a while back and I told them I am still willing to watch my niece but I refuse to watch him any longer, they kicked up a fuss stating it was unfair as my nephew loves coming over and seeing me but I told them it was that or nothing full stop. They begrudgingly agreed, not that they had much of a choice as they cant force me to watch their kids to begin with, also hiring a babysitter for 1 kids is less expensive then having them watch 2 kids.

I feel pretty bad for saying this, but it has been great to watch them since, I rarely deal with any tantrums anymore, his sister is visibly far happier and more herself she has even told me she is so happy when she gets to come over because her brother isn't here and I am just happy to watch them again.

My brother however has to deal with my nephew throwing a massive tantrum when his sister gets to come and not him and he says it is extremely difficult to explain without making him feel unwanted. So he has asked me to at least allow him to come from time to time, so far I have said no but I am feeling really bad, I also think they should explain to him why he does not get to come as a lesson of how behaviour has consequences, right?

13870,Everyone Sucks,"I met my current girlfriend of 4 years while we were in grad school. We were both very physically active but were passionate about teaching. After a year of dating, we both graduated and wanted to get our Phd's. She was accepted into a very good program while I wasn’t but took a fantastic job in a different area. During that 6 month process, I felt empty and lonely while she was extremely reluctant for me to move closer. We still wrote each other letters, I would have flowers delivered to her office and we still stayed together. I felt that I was the glue holding things together while feeling confused by her reluctance. I was able to secure a work form home position with a stellar internal team at my job, so with her blessing, I packed my things and moved.

Over the next 6 months, I noticed there was still reluctance on her end. Her PDA limit on campus was zero ( it's the work place, understandable ) but the tentativeness of me being around always odd to me. Her department secretary would melt in her chair when I'd swing by asking when my gf would be out of the office so I could plant a surprise on her desk. That spring, I wanted to bring her flowers for valentines. I knew where she was teaching that day so I wanted to put the flowers in the room she would be teaching in; girls like getting flowers but girls LOVE getting flowers in front of other people. I asked a few students around if they were going to her class. One student agreed. That night, she blew a gasket and told me to never do that again. She said that I crossed the line, interacting with her students and giving her flowers while she was teaching. I was very, very confused.

That spring, I was also accepted into my own grad program at the same school. The next two years was me being tossed around by a poorly ran department while she was getting ready to graduate. I ended up being kicked out of my program for not passing their exams. Fortunately, I moved to another department.

At this point, our relationship did a complete 180. I had started focusing on my school to help give her the space but she had since started demanding less space. She has secured a job about 1.5 hours away and wants to get a place together in between our schools ( 45 minute commute for each of us ), plan our wedding ( not engaged yet ) and expresses that she's getting ""old to have kids"" on a weekly basis. Part of me thinks I should be ecstatic since this is the reciprocation I had been desiring in the past while another part of me thinks that I should focus on my PhD and that I deserve that time & space I gave her. Whenever I bring up the past, pointing out that I gave her that space in the past and that I actually would appreciate being able to finish my degree without having to plan a wedding, travel 45 minutes every day and think about having kids; that is always met with some sort of ""it was different back then"".

Am I the asshole here?

Well i wasn't aware of that until a few years back since my dad and stepmother never told me about it. I found out when my friend, whose dad died, told me she had a savings account where her mom deposited her pension every month - so she had a considerable amount of savings that she wanted to save for hard times.

my parents told me that the money went into my expenses like food and school supplies but i feel like they forced me to pay rent so i was allowed to live with them. they stole money from a child. we are an upper middle class family and there is no way they took the money because we stuggled to survive. should a kid pay rent to live with their parents?

Now that i am a college student barely surviving month to month i am growing increasingly bitter about it. i cant work due to heavy depression and anxiety so a backup savings account would really help me in these tough times.

i wanna bring it up with my parents, i want to tell them how i feel and ask for at least a portion of that money back.

So, this was another incident back in high school. I was standing in the lunch line with this kid, Eric. Eric was your typical burnout, and we rarely if ever interacted. I only mention him being a burnout because he was known for the typical schtick of giving people a hard time for trying at anything. As I pay for my meal, Eric starts openly mocking me for having to pay $5 for my meal. Like legit ""haha, you have to pay for lunches! That's hilarious. I get my breakfast and lunch for free!"" Eric is part of the free/subsidized meal program at the school, as evidenced by how the lunch lady rings it up. He makes a few more jabs, and his friend Grant laughs along.


I'm getting tired of this and just want to eat my pizza in peace, so I ask him, ""Are you actually bragging about your family not having enough money to feed you? If that's supposed to make me feel bad, it doesn't."" 


A couple nearby kids started laughing at  him. Eric got mad, swore at me, then walked away. Two lunch ladies started yelling at me for being rude. Apparently Eric had never realized what the free/subisized meal program was and had just assumed he won some prize for free food. Turns out he was pretty devastated by this realization and was tearing up during his next class. I guess his family had done a good job hiding their financial situation from him.


The vice principal ended up casually talking to me about the issue, saying I wasn't in any trouble but that I should think about things from his point of view and be a little more understanding of other people's financial situations. She understood I wasn't intending to make fun of Eric for being poor, but that it came off that way to him. I brought the situation up with my friends after school and they were split on whether I was being rude or if Eric deserved it.

11527,Not the A-hole,"I will start by saying I pay for about 70-80% of me and my wife’s cost of living expenses (necessities). She makes about 1/3 what I do so I like for her to be able to save and have extra money for things she wants, vice dump it all into cost of living.

My wife has a friend called Yasmin. Yasmin is part of some group (it has a spanish name so I don’t know what it is) that says they empower women. My wife told me about this group one day, apparently you submit $1000 (somewhere or to someone??) and become a level 1 group member, gaining levels by recruiting more members. Once you reach level 5 or so of the community, you have about 30 people under you, and you graduate from the community and receive $30,000. All the while the group is supposed to support each other and help you attain your goals by giving you that cash infusion at the end. The whole process is supposed to take 2 months.

As soon as she told me about this, the words MLM, scam, and other things came to mind. In my opinion, this is some type of MLM disguised in a veil of “empowerment of women.” Yasmin is 4 months in and still trying to recruit people because she has not seen her money yet. Somehow Yasmin has convinced my wife to join this cause. I tried explaining to her that some MLMs *do* actually work, but those stories are few and far between and only to the insider people who started the whole thing in the first place, never the grunts that join later. I told her that if she does this she will 1) never see her money again 2) become an embarrassment to herself as she begins to essentially ask all her friends and family for money to join the program so that she can get hers 3) waste a lot of time when this never works out. I think she has good intentions, at least as far as wanting to make more money and contribute, but she has somehow gotten tricked into thinking this get rich quick maneuver will work.

When she told me she wanted to join I fought her on it and told her that I will stop helping her pay for things on this main basis: I am currently doing so because I like to help her with her basic needs/necessities so she can spend her money on things she wants.  Because this $1000->$30,000 is not a 100% guarantee, she is essentially gambling her money that she will turn a profit. In this perspective, she has money beyond her basic wants and she even has enough to gamble with, therefore there is no reason for me to still be supporting her needs/necessities. 

I will admit that I feel like I am using money to strong arm her into making a decision for her. I would normally never do this to her but I just feel so strongly that she is about to get screwed over and I don’t want to see that happen to her, so I am almost threatening her to save her from herself.

I lived with him and his family at their house, his mother, sister, his sisters fiancé and then him and I lived there. 
This past Monday an old friend of mine contacted me saying she saw him on tinder. I was really taken aback because his main reason for breaking up with me was that he needed to be alone and single to “grow”and that he couldn’t grow with anyone else in his life. I was also very angry because he used pictures of him and my dog as bait “I love dogs, look how cute mine is” pictures on his profile (she was our dog but he said he didn’t want her so I took her with me.) I sent him the screenshots my friend had taken and asked why he had an account if he wanted to be alone.

I've been with my boyfriend for a bit over a year, and he's really great and things have been awesome. But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. 

We have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.

I want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. 

I would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. 

He became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. 

So I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?

His logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. 

My logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. 

I'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are ""just what happen at strip clubs"".

She had me pay rent directly to an out of the way bank, and I was once late when he wouldn't accept a postdated check while I was away. I sent it in but was charged a $200 late fee. She never gave me an electric bill, but after the first 6 months, she sent one for $1800. I started writing my checks for $3500 so $150 would cover it. Over 4 years I helped them out by fixing things myself in order to save them the hassle and hoping my kindness would be paid forward.

As per the lease, I expressed my intent to leave within the allotted time and they accepted my notice to move by August 9th. I had it professionally cleaned with the carpets. I was told that I had to have the parking spaces cleaned for oil spots. Although there was no notice in the lease regarding this, it was easier to have it done for $100.

Upon final inspection we met, and I submitted all receipts and the keys. She mentions that there  were missed oil spots in the parking stall and it would have to be re-cleaned. She then asked me questions about damage that was there before I moved in. I explained it was on the pre-inspection checklist. There was also a stubborn stain on the carpet that didn't get out 100%. She asked me repeatedly if I had an animal and if it was urine from a dog. I politely explained I have never had any pets there.

I have moved many states away and in the last month have received many texts and e-mails asking me about a pet and describing very minimal damages. I told her I had no pets and those items were damaged prior. Of course, I cannot inspect these items now.

Last week I received a letter, saying she forgot to mention there was over $3000 of unpaid electricity and that they had to fix items they re-cleaned some things (with costs but no receipt). None of this was mentioned when we were in the apartment. There were no receipts and the estimates had no cost. Also not mentioned were my 3+ years of paying an extra $150 for electricity.

I came from a very renter friendly state and the laws are written as such. A few examples are: 1. Notice of any withheld money must be sent or delivered on or before the 14th day after expiration. 2. Any work done or money to be collected must be accompanied by receipts. 3. If there was estimated work to be done, it must have an amount.

In regard to these issues, 1. The notice was postmarked August 24th, and since the lease ended on the 9th, the 24th would be considered the 15th day. 2. No receipts were given for work done or the electricity. 3. The estimated work was left blank.

14332,Asshole,"My boyfriend and I are both college students. I have an job in addition to my classes and am very involved in on-campus groups, so I am very busy. My boyfriend has his classes and one or two activities, so he has a lot more free time than me. This is totally fine with me, as I am honestly more busy than anyone should be. However, he spends all of his free time sleeping. If he has nothing to do in the morning, he will stay in bed until anywhere between noon and 3. If he has to go somewhere in the morning, he will go back to his room and nap for several hours. I can't really fault him, because if I had the free time he has I would spend a lot of it sleeping, too. But I want to be able to text him at 11:30 to make lunch plans and get a response, or at least know he'll see the text within the next hour and a half. Hell, I want to be able to text him throughout my day because I like talking to him, but since we're not physically spending time together in that scenario it feels exceedingly selfish to ask him to be awake for just that.

I told the doctor to excuse me for a second and told the med students that they needed to leave the room immediately. One of them asked me why and I told them that they hadn't introduced themselves to me in any way, had never received my permission to touch my child(let alone take his diaper off), and therefore were not welcome in his room.

I was born when my parents were both 19, and my only other brother (let's call him Josh) was born when they were 42. They divorced shortly after Josh was introduced to the world (he was 4 months old at the time), and they both wanted nothing to do with the child. At the time, I was 23 and I was living alone with my then-girlfriend who was 21 (now my wife), and I done my best to convince at least ONE of them to take care of young Josh for his sake and the family's sake, but they refused adamantly and said that I should be taking custody of him instead. So I became legal guardian of my brother and he's been living with us for the past 12 years and things have been going really smooth for us.

Josh, now almost 13, has been calling me ""dad"" and my wife ""mum"" and our two children (4F, 9M) his siblings and he has absolutely NO idea about his real parents, and to be honest, I let all of that slide. He has NO idea that I'm really his blood brother and not his father, and I'm starting to feel guilty and a little weird.

Some of my uncles and aunts come to visit occasionally and they are really disgusted at the fact he calls me ""dad"" and they are surprised I haven't told him the truth. They constantly messaged me, talked to me in private and I cannot chat to them without this one particular topic rising up - badgering me to let him know already but I refused.

I discussed this with my wife and she thought it would be wrong to tell him the truth because none of my parents wanted to take care of him and I'm the only person in the world who gave him the ""father figure"" everyone deserves.

I feel that he has the right to know what he is to me and what I truly am to him, but he's suffered enough already and I just want things to continue how it is. Reddit, AITA? WIBTA if I let him know the truth?

I made a light hearted joke and chuckled, ""Haha you're such a typical beemer driver!"" He didn't laugh, he brushed it off and didn't change his driving habits. He said a few times ""I've been driving longer than you've been alive."" and ""I'm a very good driver.""

7007,No A-holes here,"Context: I'm getting married in two weeks. My fiance has worked extremely hard planning this wedding. She is planning the majority of it, as well as paying for most of it as our families are not well off, and she's the breadwinner. It's a very important day for us. I understand something will always go wrong at a wedding, and it'll never be ""perfect"", but as long as it's with her I'll be happy. 

She gave me one task for the whole wedding: Make sure my groomsmen are matching. Simple enough. I found some slacks online for 40 bucks and told my groomsmen they could wear whatever they want for a shirt, but the pants must all be the same color. I sent the link to them for the pants 5 months ago and it seemed everything was in order.

I just got a message from one of them saying he blew it, and he ""wished"" he'd  had an excuse, and he needs the link for the pants again. That's fine, but then he messages again saying he already has pants of that color anyways and he'll just wear those. I tell him as long as they're the EXACT same color, and to check with another one of the groomsmen who lives near him to see if they match. He responds jokingly, and now I'm concerned that he's gonna show up to the wedding in completely off-colored pants. If that is the case, I don't even want him up there. He was already extremely difficult during the bachelor party, and generally had a bad attitude because I didn't want to order strippers. He is my longest childhood friend, and it'd suck for him not to be up there with me, but his selfish behavior has only gotten worse as we grow older.

He texts back this needlessly long text full of paragraphs that called me out for saying when it was unsettling when he didn't see how it could be and how they bonded over the trip and how she's an adult and can make her own decisions and how I'm just looking for drama with him.

Until he sat me down and told me that he was dumping me. I was so shocked and the last thing I wanted to do, was let him know I was hurt. So I acted relieved. That confused him, so I told him that I was glad he was ending things. I didn't think I ever loved him, but now I won't hurt him and we can still be friends. No worries.

He got so fucking mad, and said that NOW there's no way, we could EVER be friends. He wanted to be friends, until I said I never loved him.

I didn't understand how he could be mad that I didn't love him, if he didn't love me? **Did he expect me to cry and beg for him to take me back?**

This was a couple weeks ago and we haven't talked since. I ran into his friend at a coffee shop and he paged the fuck out me. He said that what I told my ex ""seriously fucked him"". He doesn't sleep, or eat properly. He's behind in all his classes, and missed practices because of me. But I think it was probably more than just one comment I made. He called me an ""evil bitch"". I was in shock so I didn't say anything back.

What I said wasn't true, but I needed to seem so unbothered by being dumped. He broke my heart, but I didn't want to show it. I don't understand it (because he, dumped me), but it doesn't change the fact that I hate he's feeling this way. I did want to hurt him a little, at the time, I won't lie.

14364,No A-holes here,"My husband (32m) and I (30f) had decided to try to get pregnant this summer. I’ve always been pretty on the fence as to if I wanted children or not and in the earlier parts of our relationship (we’ve been together 10 years, married 4) my husband also said he could go either way. In the last couple years, after seeing most of our close friends become parents, my husband came to the decision that he does really want kids. He never pressured me and understood I may decide I didn’t want them and always said he’d be ok if that were the case. 

In the last few years a lot of great things have fallen in place for us. We bought a beautiful house, he was promoted to CFO at his job and now makes really good money, I found a teaching job in the district I had always really wanted to be in (I spent the first 5 years of my teaching career being laid off or bounced between schools). I decided that I was really comfortable with where things were and I was ready to start thinking about getting pregnant and starting a family. I told my husband and he was elated. We decided this summer would be a good time to begin trying. I talked with my OBGYN, began taking prenatal vitamins, and everything was good. 

Then a couple weeks ago, I got a lay-off notice from my job. There’s a huge budget deficit this year due to state aid not coming through, and the outcome looks pretty bleak. I’ve been here for four years and honestly felt blindsided by it because we haven’t had any budget issues in the years I’ve been here. I’m still contracted through the end of this school year but that’s it. There is a definite chance I could be called back before next school year, but also a chance I may not. 

I told my husband I no longer want to try to get pregnant this summer because of this. He feels like this is really unfair and I’m letting a situation out of our control dictate the future of our family. I told him I’m incredibly stressed at the idea of losing my job (I love my district, coworkers, curriculum, etc) and that it’s devastating to think about not being there next year. I don’t want the added stress of trying to get pregnant or being pregnant with so much uncertainty. Also, I’m very close with my current coworkers, and the thought of not having them as a support during a pregnancy is really scary. He argues that his job is very secure and that he makes enough money to support us (and potential children) without me needing to work. He also says we have his family and coworkers as support systems throughout a pregnancy and after childbirth.

We’ve talked about it a lot over the last week and he ascertains my decision is unreasonable and is very upset. He also feels like he has little say in the matter, that I’m making this decision without him, and that’s frustrating him.

Last night I went to a bar after visiting a friend of mine. I just wanted something to drink and I was feeling good so I said to myself why the hell not? Anyways I sit down at the bar. I'm casually talking with the bartender and shooting the shit with some drunk dude next to me. After a few minutes a guy and a girl come in and the girl sits next to me.

I'm talking going out of her way to touch me for whatever reason, laughing at everything I say and making strong eye contact. I noticed that she was really attractive and our conversation went smooth, and when the guy came back she was barely paying any attention to him.

To keep it short, she started blatantly hitting on me, and she ended up coming home with me and we slept together. Initially I felt bad for the dude but she clearly made a choice, and I gladly accepted it. I don't feel like I did anything wrong. Am I the asshole in this situation?

311,Not the A-hole,"I probably should start by saying that I was raised in a somewhat religious environment but I'm now agnostic (leaning towards atheist). I've definitely been open with my friends about my lack of belief in any religion and most of my friends have respected that. I don't have a problem with people who follow any particular religion, I just want nothing to do with it myself.

So at the start of the year I noticed one of my friends, who was already kind of religious, was suddenly extremely religious. Like they would turn every conversation into a chance to discuss religion, they always posted on Instagram and Facebook about religion, etc. She's a really nice and sweet person so I didn't complain about it - it's good for her if religion makes her happy. But I started hanging out with her less since she became difficult to talk to and I didn't want to tell her to stop talking about something she clearly cares about so much. 

More recently I noticed she was spamming all our group chats with links to virtual church services for Easter, which I was a little bit annoyed by but I didn't really say anything because there are a few Christians/religious people in those chats who were probably interested and appreciated it.

The problem was when she messaged me directly yesterday and said she was forming a group to teach a course designed by her church (to be honest don't really know what that entails). Again, totally fine that she wants to do that - it's just that she knows I am not religious and never want to be. Our conversation went something like this:

Friend: So do you want to join?

Me: No thanks.

Friend: Can I ask why?

Me: You know I'm not interested in anything to do with religion.

Friend: It would mean a lot if you would support me, could you maybe try it once?

Me: I'm sorry but I really don't want to do it and I don't want to argue about it.

Friend: I just want to spread God's word and help people. I'm trying something new and you could just give it a chance.

Me: You could just stop forcing your religion onto people who clearly aren't interested.

She didn't reply after that, but later I started getting messages from a couple of her friends saying that I really hurt her feelings and that I should have just played along instead of being stubborn. 

Looking back I'm thinking that I probably could have been more polite and sucked it up for one session at least, to show support for a friend who probably only had good intentions.

907,Not the A-hole,"So, on Reddit I disclose pretty often when it's relevant to a conversation, that I am Chinese & Filipino. In person, I will discuss it with Asians if it comes up, but when (almost always) white people try to figure out what ethnicity I am, I don't answer.

It started because these questions inevitably come in two rude forms: ""Where are you from?"" (I was born and raised in New York! ""But where are you REALLY from?"" Manhattan!) and ""What are you?"" (Human being!). If a friend or coworker gets to know me it obviously eventually comes up naturally, so it's not like I'm keeping my ethnicity a secret, but now I just decline to answer. I've discussed this with other non-white friends and we all basically agree with the Hari Kondabalu bit where he says that this question really means, 'Why aren't you white?'

Recently, I had a really awkward moment with a friend's husband where he asked me where I was from and he became really annoyed and offended that I wouldn't answer or was 'playing games' (because I answered where I was from with the cross streets in Manhattan where I grew up).

To keep the budget low, my fiancé and I left people off the list that we would have wanted to come because the guest count was getting too high. Also, we did not give most of the single guests a +1. To be honest, I didn’t want my parents to have to pay for random tinder dates that the single ones would have brought along. The only single guests that got a +1 were the ones that wouldn’t know anyone at the wedding. 

One guest we invited is a family friend. We did not give them +1 because they (as far as we knew) were single and are a longtime family friend so they will know plenty of people at the wedding. We recently got back their RSVP card where they scratched out the “1” signifying the number of seats we were giving them and wrote in a “2” with a “please!? Love ya!” written under it. 

I told my parents, they laughed at the audacity, but ultimately have a “what can you do” attitude and included them in the count. I want to disinvite this guest’s +1. I feel like it’s rude to automatically assume we can accommodate extra guests, especially since we left people off to keep costs low. I feel like if they thought us giving them 1 invite instead of 2 was an oversight on our part, they should have called us to at least have a dialogue about it and see if we could accommodate instead of automatically assuming. Am I being petty? AITA for wanting to tell this person they get one invite only?

I am (48M) and my daughter is 23. Her mother died when she was 12 so it’s just been me and her for a long time. For context I’ll call my daughter Mandy.

Mandy was a mess after her mom died and I was too as we were very happily married and she died suddenly when she was only 37. It took a long time for us to heal, especially Mandy. She ended up spending years doing very badly in school and only in the last few years got the same qualifications at college level and started a history and politics degree last year and she’s expecting to go in second year in September.

She became very driven and did remarkably well in her first year and I’m very proud of her. However, she started associating with a crowd of people and she changed drastically. These kids believe in basically not working and living off of other people’s money so you never have to do anything for money in life. I was slightly alarmed and just said to Mandy to be careful but it was clear she started to believe this. 

She is now dating one of these kids and has recently been talking about quitting her job, jacking in university and basically having a baby so she can get as much state benefit as she can and have all this money without having to work for it. Now, I currently pay for her tuition and other things like her phone as she doesn’t work that much and she has even jokingly said I could use all that tuition money to just fund her new lifestyle. I told her if she was hellbent On having a kid purely to reap state benefits, it was a horrible thing to do and I would cut her off financially from everything. I said it was a horrible idea as there are people who genuinely need that money and to bring a kid into this world for selfish reasons is even shittier.

Well, she kicked off saying why couldn’t I support her “dream.” I said it wasn’t a dream at all and that she had everything going for her and she would be an idiot to throw it all away and that I wasn’t going to support it at all. She thinks I’m the biggest AH in the world for not wanting to give her free money and she’s somehow even convinced my mom and former MIL that I’m somehow being sexist by expecting her to do certain things in order for me to keep providing for her?

The only person who actually is on my side it seems is my brother who thinks Mandy is acting crazy.

However, my wedding is going to be an adults-only event. My mom feels very strongly that weddings are not a place for kids, and, to be honest, I kind of agree. At least, young children who might cry or just make noise in general have been distracting at weddings I’ve been to in the past. I’m sorry to anybody who disagrees; it’s not personal. 

Anyway, my BIL and his wife are adamantly insisting that they are going to bring the baby to the wedding, even after my fiancé mentioned a few times that we were not going to have kids at the wedding. Not only is my BIL insisting on bringing him, but he says it very aggressively, like “f*** that, I’m bringing my m******f***ing kid wherever I want.”  I am trying to be understanding of the fact that they are new parents and probably both excited to introduce family the baby and worried about leaving the baby with anyone else. But they are both in the bridal party, with him being the best man and her a bridesmaid, so they won’t really be able to hold the baby that much. Also I am worried that the responsibility of watching the baby will fall on my fiancé’s mom, dad, sister, or other close relatives and prevent them from being engaged in the day. I really think that would be hurtful to my fiancé in some way. My fiancé and his brother do not have the best relationship as it is and I do not want there to be any added tension between them at the wedding. 

Not to mention, my mom, who can be a very intimidating person, is absolutely 100% not willing to make an exception and allow the baby at the wedding. She said that if my BIL tried to bring the baby she would send him home... and I believe her.

So recently my 16yo brother in law went through some hard times with his father. (Alcoholic and verbally abusive.) My wife and I (25MF) decided to take him into our home so he can focus on school and get away from the awful homelife that he had. Things started off well but quickly began to deteriorate throughout the 2018-2019 school year. He made a new friend who is currently going through similar issues and my wife is allowing him to stay as long as they enforce each other to go to school. Unfortunately, things have been pretty rough. Neither will help with chores and they hardly go to school. (School year just started and they've missed 10/18 days). They pretty much just spend everyday smoking pot and playing video games. Today my wife got a call from a social worker who warned us about possible truancy charges if this continues. At this point, I definitely don't want to be held responsible for his friend and am contemplating the same for my brother-in-law.

8829,Everyone Sucks,"I work, my wife is a stay at home mom to our boys. I have the upmost love and respect for her doing so. The money I make has always been “our money”, as I feel it should be. She does her part at home, while I do mine at work. I have never said this once in the 5 years she’s been a stay at home mom until today, I swear.

Around Christmas, my wife wanted to get both the boys (them 17 months and 4), iPads. I suggested that we just get a tablet for the oldest as I didn’t think our youngest needed one quite yet and to go with a cheaper, child friendly model with more parental control and a built in case. I also said since it was a big purchase we should discuss it more. I come home the next night from work...and she’s purchased two iPads for the kids. I calmly asked her about it and she said she thought it’d be a good idea, plus our youngest would grow into his. It was the holidays. I didn’t want to fight, so I didn’t. Even when she continued to go above the budget that we had agreed on and hell, that was her idea. We weren’t going destitute over it and the boys were happy...so fine. I’m not going to be the grinch.

7 months later and we now only have one of the iPads. Our youngest smashed his in a tantrum while we were on vacation. And because my wife got these used, there was no insurance. I can’t say he even misses it. 

However, his second birthday is coming up. My wife wants to get him an iPod. I said that after the iPad, I think that’s a terrible idea. She said he loves music and I suggested she just play him some on hers or I’ll use mine. Or as a compromise, we’ll get him a CD player that we have to control that way he doesn’t have a chance of smashing it. She was pushing this iPod Touch.

Eventually, I put my foot down and told her no, that he’s 2 and he doesn’t need another electronic device that he’s just going to break in 2 months. And I told her if she went out and bought one, I’d return it. She got mad and I finally said that I made the money, so I wasn’t going to let her waste it on crap that a 2 year old couldn’t reasonably be expected to take care of. (And yes, I’d keep it out of reach or put the case on it, but she’d take it off or give it back as soon as he got upset that it was bothering him.)

She got mad and we aren’t speaking. I just feel like this is becoming an issue with every birthday. Like she wanted to get our oldest a laptop for his 5th and I asked why he needed one, though she let go of that when she couldn’t explain why a kid going into kindy needed both a tablet and a computer when his parents also had computers.

Just like other kids his age he likes video games and YouTube etc. We are kind of isolated in our community so there isn't really an opportunity to get out unless we drive him places (which we are happy to do). He went on a community outing today with other kids his age. He arrived back home and seemed happy and had a good time and told me about everything he did.

Then, while I was at work later in an aside, I was informed by my community ""youth worker"" in a ""by-the-way"" fashion, that Jake seemed to be very quiet when in groups of other kids his age (13 years to 16 years) when they were talking about partying, drinking, smoking (cigarettes/drugs) and girls/sex. She said he just kind of sat back and said nothing during these conversations which she observed. She wondered if something was wrong with him and that perhaps we should talk to him to see if something was wrong.

Initially, I thought ""is something wrong?"" but I quickly turned my attitude into ""is there something wrong with you to think the kid being good has an issue?""...

I told her my son, at 15, was perfectly fine being quiet and introverted a bit. Why is NOT drinking, smoking, partying and sex at 14-15 abnormal? I don't need a grandchild next year! Fuck me!

I told her that instead of coming to me with her concerns about my son, perhaps she should go speak with all the other kid's parents about their underage drinking, smoking, drug use, and sex and don't try and say my son has an issue because he is not out getting hammered at 15. I did this in public and I was pissed off about the situation. That's the only bit I'm feeling a little asshole-ish about. She was certainly taken aback and while I will see her every day I don't have too much respect for her anymore.

I work from home and have a 3 y/o son. My schedule has always allowed me to look after our son and take him to local groups for new parents and babies, and through those I wound up with a group of friends, all parents of similar ages to me with kids similar ages to my son.

We're all stay-at-homes (some work, others don't) and our kids get on great. At some point we went from formal groups to just meeting at each other's houses or the playground so the kids can play and we can interact with other adults. Some of the parents are men, and call themselves ""stay at home dads"", but there's about 2 men and 6 women, so even they refer to it as ""SAHMs club"".

My husband has done a 9-5 every day of the week until last month, when he switched to a new job. This new job is at a small company owned by his buddy with a far more flexible schedule, better pay and opportunity to work from home. He did this because he's realised that he missed out on a lot these last few years.

His last job required him to always be in the office, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week (plus commute) which meant that he wound up missing out on a lot of stuff. First words, first steps, ect. I did film them and send it to him, but it's not the same.

With the new job, if he doesn't have anything that requires he go into the office, he asks if he can work from home, which the friend usually agrees to, but there are still days where he has to go in. I am still working from home every day of the week.

It was my turn to host the SAHM club last week and my husband was here. We explained the new schedule and my friends congratulated him on his new job, commended him for wanting to spend more time with our son, and one of the other dads referred to him as a ""fellow stay at home dad"". He got kind of defensive, saying ""no, I actually work"", and the other dad sensed something was up, apologised and changed the subject. They still talked with him after that but it was a little tense.

Later I brought it up and my husband told me he thought of ""stay at home"" as being derogatory, and he's never thought of me as a ""stay at home"" because I work. I explained that about half the club still works, some from home, others part time, and it wasn't a bad thing to be a stay-at-home. He just said he wasn't really into being called that, which I said was fair enough and that was the end of it.

However, after that I was a little cautious about him being around the club, just because he got defensive and in our conversation he indicated that he didn't have a great opinion of the ones who were actually full time stay at home parents.

My husband asked about plans for tomorrow and I said I wasn't sure, which was true, and then I remembered that the SAHM group is going to the local pool. They have a kiddie pool that's about a foot deep with toys/slides/stuff like that. My husband isn't sure if he'll be in the office or not.

Since the ceremony begins fairly early, my eight fraternity brothers (I know) and I decide to get up even earlier to get properly tanked. After a couple hours of drinking, we get together to pose for group photos in our grad caps. 

During the last photo, I decided to it would be hilarious to surreptitiously hang my flaccid wang over the waistband of my shorts--the idea being that no one would notice my exposed Johnson until after the picture came out and we’d all have a laugh. It worked, and we did (though one of my friends was annoyed that I ruined the photo.)

Needless to say, I was pretty fucking pissed at the time and to be honest, it still irks me a bit to this day. But when I confronted him about it, he basically said if you didn’t want this on social media you shouldn’t have done it.

My husband and I married last year, dated four years before that. We’re in an interracial relationship. As per tradition in their family, his mother gave me their family recipe for a culture-specific dish. The recipe is only to be given to and made by the women in the family.

I accepted gratefully and was happy she gave it to me. However the recipe isn’t my favorite. There’s one particular ingredient in it that I find to be very, very strong and overpowering. It’s not awful and I eat it when cooked for me. My husband explained that it’s a popular ingredient in the region where his family is from, so that’s why it’s so strong and not common in other versions of it, or the westernized versions.

I make the dish occasionally, since it’s pretty simple and can feed a lot of people. However I usually make half a batch the traditional way, and the other half with less of this one ingredient cause I enjoy it more. My husband eats it both ways.

A few days ago two of his sisters and their partners came over to see our new place. I cooked dinner, which included the dish, and I made it my usual half/half way. No one had any complaints except the older sister. She said the food wasn’t like their mother’s cooking. I told her she probably got the modified half rather than the tradition one. In response she got a bit snippy and said I shouldn’t have changed the family recipe just to suit my “American” tastes. She said my MIL shouldn’t have given me the recipe if I was just gonna butcher it.

My husband stepped in and told his sister to back off, but I haven’t stopped thinking about this. I feel guilty for changing this food, but my husband assured me she was just doing that to be petty.

6880,Not the A-hole,"I came home from a class last night and to my surprise, there was a little orange tabby laying on my doorstep. The poor thing is so skinny and malnourished (you can see his spine and ribs). His fur was matted and he was just covered in dirt, plant matter and bugs. He is incredibly friendly though, so we had suspicipns he is someone's pet. My husband and I have posted on pet FBI, Next Door, Facebook and other social media to broadcast if anyone had lost this little tabby. We took him in and he is currently living in our garage. 

The two us had a few hits that someone was missing their cat in our area, but none of the cats matched his description. When I took him to the vet today, they told me he doesn't have any microchips in him, so he was probably a stray. With that info, we started asking around our friends and family if anyone would want to adopt this very friendly and loving cat. 2 of my husband's friends at work have actually been in the market for a cat, so they said as long as he is litter trained, they would take him.

However, shortly after getting the news that he was going to a good home with people I trust, I got a message from a woman in my neighborhood. She told me that this cat belonged to her and her son and it ran away from home. She had been looking for it for 3 weeks now. I checked her post history and she had not posted anything about a missing cat. I asked her if her cat was chipped and she said of course. I then asked her what kind of cat it was and she said a tabby. No specification on color. I was a bit suspicious so I looked through her post history and there was 0 mention of a missing cat, or any cat in general.

When I told her that the cat we have is not chipped, she started going off on me and saying I was holding their cat hostage and I am a horrible person, how could I do this to her 10-year old son who loved his cat, Cheddar? She told me that I was lying or the vet was lying when they said this cat didn't have a microchip. She said she was going to come to my house to take this cat, which I declined and told her she was not taking this cat, even if she is the rightful owner.

Edit 2: Thanks so much for the feedback and support. I just got some new info that makes me think she was trying to get a free cat, or that this isn't her cat to begin with! In the event she is missing her cat, I do hope she finds it soon. 

I was unaware that my neighborhood has its own stray/feral cat colony that lives in the woods nearby. My husband was talking to a neighbor today and the neighbor said that there's maybe like 10-20 cats living in the woods.

9222,Not the A-hole,"I have 5 siblings, all adults, and we all live close by. My sister lives in our rental home next door and my youngest sibling and his girlfriend live with me. 

My sis and I had planned an evening get together, beginning at 6. About 2 hours prior, I was coming home from getting supplies when I saw one of my brothers, S, walking towards my house. 

I got really mad, bc I wanted to relax for an hour before everyone showed up. I locked the doors and turned my surround sound up to drown out any noises. I also sent my sis a text so she could do the same.

Up til about a month ago, S has been in the throws of a serious meth problem that had all but pushed away everyone. S and I had the same mother, who passed long ago. I've always coddled him a little more than I probably should out of loyalty to her. 

The drug abuse led to us getting burned by S multiple times, and he's generally ungrateful for the things we do to help him. His water was recently shut off and I've brought him gallons upon gallons so he can continue flushing toilets.

Last week, S relapsed and did meth for 2 days. Towards the end of his last binge, the family told him that we couldn't continue to help him when he's like this.

I got a message from him that read ""thanks for locking me out."" I snapped. I didn't ""lock him out"" for any other reason than wanting an hour of peace and quiet before having to play host. He sent a follow up message that said he ""figured it would be okay to come early and to shower."" 

When everyone arrived, my oldest brother reached out to S and again invited him. S sent me a long message about how it was clear he wasn't wanted, adding that ""it's no wonder I do drugs."" 

I know that I'm not responsible for his drug use, but for him to blame me or the family enrages me, because we go out of our way to help him when he does nothing to help himself. He doesn't see it that way, apparently, and believes he's being shunned by the family despite a month of sobriety before last week's relapse. He wouldn't hear my explanations and instead ended our conversation with this: 

""even tho u help u make it known how inconvenient it is. and i still show my appreciation and let u know it despite the gripe. ill have my shit together soon enough and ill manage myself but ive been sober for a minute despite a brief relapse which has came and went and on one occasion OLDEST BRO reached out to me, that should bother me. but ill act like it dont and pretend everything is peachy while i put my cards together.""

However, his timings have really annoyed me. He keeps having massive weightlifting sessions just before events and trips, which inevitably results in him being in too much pain to do anything, particularly after leg day.

We recently went to Budapest for a long weekend and we had a whole itinerary planned. A couple of nights before we left, he had his leg day. He spent the whole time limping and complaining about the pain and we ended up doing just two of the things we had planned. By the Sunday I snapped and told him, in summary, that I didn’t care he was in pain, because he did it to himself and that I was fed up with listening to him whine and sitting around doing nothing, all because he refused to reschedule leg day.

He got very upset with me and said I was being unsupportive, that I cared more about our itinerary (which we made together by the way) than I do about him.

17952,not the a-hole,"Backstory:
This girl and I have been really hitting it off this semester. We have had 2 months as friends and a month as a couple. We are young but have matured in order for our relation to keep going forward.
When we go out together I feel like she is not there. She keeps conversations to herself and says it’s nothing. She has been telling me she has “deja vu’s” of her ex and it’s getting under my skin. She was in a psychological abusive relation and she calls herself “damaged goods.” She believes she is not good enough for me but she is the only girl I want to be with. 

Today was got annoyed by her not being able to vibe with me, she was just in her head while I tried to make interesting conversations. I asked what was keeping her from being herself and she said she wanted closure. Closure from her ex, as her and her ex didn’t tie their loose ends. The only way she could do this was in person. I’m my head, I feel like she has some feelings in her and I was not going to get hurt by being in the middle of it. I told her that I needed to let her go so she can truly decide what she wants, and that I’d wait till the end of the semester for her. She treats me real nice and I miss her, I made her cry. As of now I do not know if I dodged a bullet or lost the only person I care about.

Thank you, everyone, for your input. I don’t have many people who would genuinely care but you guys made me feel like you did. As of now, we agreed that she will try to tie all her loose ends and by the end of the week, she will have a serious answer.

5418,No A-holes here,"It would be after the actual wedding. My twin brother and his girlfriend are getting married in Paris on 31/8. Me and my girlfriend of 3 years are taking the eurostar there on 29/8, as are a lot of our family and mutual friends. After the wedding, on 1/9 the newlyweds are heading to the South of France for their honeymoon, but me, my girlfriend, my parents, and a few friends have decided (separately) to stay a couple extra days. Me and my girlfriend don't leave until 5/9, our friends leave the day before, my parents leave the day after.

I've asked her about proposing and she said she'd love for me to propose, and she'd say yes, and we agreed to a public proposal. She loves cliches and thinks Paris is really romantic, but she doesn't think I'll propose any time soon (I asked in a way where it could be any time).

I want to take her to the Eiffel Tower on 3/9, just the two of us, and pop the question. I want to do it on that date specifically as our friends and family will all still be in Paris, and she's said she would want to tell them as soon as it happened.

However, this would mean doing it literally 3 days after my brother's wedding. IDK if that's the best idea, but the only reason we can go to Paris is that my parents are paying for everything, IDK when we'll next be able to go.

WIBTA?

EDIT: I asked my brother and he just said ""your proposal, up to you"" but IDK if that actually means he's alright with it. It kind of reminds me of that line in Jurassic Park ""your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could that they didn't stop to think if they should""

Also: my girlfriend and I got together in Paris. We went with some friends (including the ones who will be in Paris on the date), at some point on the first trip we got drunk and admitted we liked each other. We went there as friends and left in a relationship, and had our first date at a cafe near the Eiffel Tower. Admittedly not the most romantic story but it's ours, and proposing in the same place feels right. If we'd gotten together back in England I'd still have gone wherever we had our first date to propose. My brother and his bride have never been. I know they're getting married there but if it's anyone's ""place"", it's ours. Didn't want to say this in case people think I'm trying to reclaim it or some shit, but now people are saying it's my brother and his bride's place, so doing anything there would lose significance to them, and while I know we can't ""claim"" a city, if either couple gets Paris it's just not my brother.

For everyone saying we're already engaged: I asked my girlfriend if when I propose she'd want a public or private proposal and if she'd want it to be a surprise. She said it was my call. I want to take her back to where we got together to propose, so my choices are either the Eiffel tower or a room in a youth hostel, and the tower feels like the more romantic option.

But yesterday was one of the biggest fights we've had because like the title suggests he called me another girls name over text.

It started off very simple with him texting him good morning me saying the same thing back, both of us asking each other how we are and what we were doing and if we had any plans. Then the communication just cut off for about two hours and he suddenly text me ""ur cute btw ;).""  And to me this didnt seem very suspicious maybe a bit weird but not suspicious. So I say ""thanks ur not so bad yourself"" and this is where the shit show starts. He responds with ""no problem [girls name here] 💕💓."" Obviously taken aback I say this girls name with a question mark and he starts to explain himself and that he was thinking about her while texting me so he got our names mixed up. I thought this was a bs excuse and told him this and he said that ""I can't really take back what I text so I'm not sure what you expect me to do"" and then proceeded to leave the convo after about 30 more minutes of back and forth arguing.

4072,Asshole,"For a few years now I've been living with three friends of mine, one whom we'll call Mary. Mary used to have problems with her eating years ago which have since resolved, but apparently have made a comeback this year. She's always been on the slim side but since the start of this year she's been putting away a ridiculous amount of food - and I mean ridiculous. Buying and eating whole cakes, tubs of ice cream, bars of chocolate, the list goes on. At first Mary was buying her own stuff, but eventually she stopped. THEN communal food starts to go missing. Cookies, chips, syrup, ice cream, cereal. It would be replaced quickly but then quickly disappear all over again, and after a while of that Mary sat us all down for a house meeting and told us she had a serious problem right now and asked us all to please keep food like that in our room as she was really struggling to control herself right now.

My other two room-mates were okay with this, but I put my foot down. I didn't think it was fair for me to pay rent to have to hide food in my room, which is already pretty packed, rather than the kitchen I was paying for. My friends thought I was being a bit of a TA for that but understood where I was coming from.

Things have gotten worse since and the food pretty much will instantly vanish. I can put cookies in the pantry and guarantee that in 12 hours they will be gone. She replaces the food but then eats it herself pretty much instantly, so basically it's just her eating my things and buying more things for herself to eat which has really started to get on my nerves. The straw that broke the camels back and is when I came home with a slice of my sisters wedding cake. I would think she would have the decency to stay away from that, but nope. She lasted all of two days and then it was gone. After this I confronted her with a bunch of receipts I'd been saving and demanded she pay me in full for everything, given it was basically her eating this stuff over and over again while everyone else missed out.

She became extremely emotional over this but in the end agreed she'd pay for everything and that she was in the wrong. Since then she's informed the house that she's planning to move back to her parents later this week.

20541,Asshole,"I am truly hoping that this will be a N-A-H situation, but I fear there is a very really real possibility that I am the AH, therefore I am asking the public to weigh in. 
I (34F) found out about 7 months ago that I have breast cancer. 
No family history. No preexisting conditions. No concerns about breast cancer until I happened upon a lump during a routine self exam.
I immediately told/showed my husband (39M) the lump and I made an appointment with my primary care physician (PCP) who then referred me to an oncologist, and long story short, I have stage 3 breast cancer and roughly 5+ years to live.
After taking some time to seek out a counselor and join a support group (and accept my prognosis), my husband and I notified our families who were understandably DEVASTATED.
Our families (both of our parents are still together and each of us have a brother) immediately began asking us about treatment plans regarding chemo and radiation and my husband I explained that I plan on pursing any and all treatment options regardless of physical/mental/financial costs.
Our families were quickly put at ease and later on during the evening my mother and mother-in-law (who is actually a breast cancer survivor) pulled me aside and asked about my and my husband’s plans for potential children... My husband and I actually had plans to begin trying to conceive children at the beginning of this year and obviously things have been put on hold. Both my mother and mother-in-law suggested possibly trying for a baby BEFORE my treatments begin (I never began my treatments due to the current world events - my doctors did not want to lower my immune system in the midst of a p*ndemic), and I actually agree with their wisdom... If I have 5+ years to live then I will have plenty of time to birth and bond with a baby and if, gosh forbid, I leave this planet in ~5 years then I will leave my child in the all to capable hands of my husband and with the support of our families.
My husband is... less than on board with this idea. He hates the idea of conceiving a child while my life has an expiration date (however, don’t all lives have expiration dates?), and he does not want to be a single dad (although I have discussed with him at length that if I do die before him I want him to grieve and then date and find another partner).
Although I understand his position, I just can’t fathom the idea of dying before I give birth and meet my future child... I simply cannot face death knowing that huge part of my life will go unanswered.

Don't get me wrong, he's nice. Doesn't insult me, occasionally pays for dinner (he's a student), says he loves me, etc. But he doesn't always take no for an answer. For example, on Friday he was over at my place. We were spooning in my bed watching tv and he tried to put his hand up my shirt to rest on my stomach. I said no and pushed his hand.

At any rate, my wife’s family has 2 group chats;
- one with her parents, their 3 kids (including my wife) and their significant others (including me) 
- one with just her parents and their 3 kids (let’s call this the ‘family only’) 

The exclusive ‘family only’ chat dings away daily and l, you guessed it, the one with the significant others gets about as much use as a push up bra in a convent.

It’s been grating me for a while that they continually post stuff on the family only chat, mainly cause a lot of it is about my kids and I’ve also seen it used to post photos of me in a joking manner without my knowledge. 

My wife tried to show me some photos from the ‘family only’ chat tonight and I told her I wasn’t interested at looking at it and if they wanted me to see something their could post it on the chat I am in. She said that I’m being “weird about it” and that “it’s no big deal”. She said she would just add me which she has said previously when I’ve bitched about it but it never eventuated. The name of the group is all of their initials so I wouldn’t want to ruin their little acronym anyway. 

AITA for even caring about this? I  honestly don’t know why it grates me but i just think it’s BS family politics. 

For the record my family has a similar chat and my wife is in that group, 

Over to you reddit.

Edit - point taken. I’ll stop being a whiney self centred POS. Some people on here need to chill the f out though, all I’ve done is have a whinge about something that’s grating me on here and I’ve barely mentioned anything about it verbally. Just thought I’d post to see if my personal compass is out of whack, but some people are just scathing as anything. Guess it comes with the redditory

Edit 2 - also strikes me as odd that I’ve been banned from posting on this sub for a month meaning I can’t respond to any comments. Don’t think I’ve said anything mildly controversial. I did write YTA in one response but it was only to remind the person that they forgot to include the judgement in his response, in which they made it abundantly clear IATA.

Edit 3 - it really dawned on me reading these responses that it is people’s opinion on what constitutes ‘family’ which swayed their views. The blood is thicker than water gang (about 70% at a guess) were quick to label me the A as I am not family so should never expect to be in their family chat. 
Those who subscribe to the idea that once you get hitched you are ‘welcomed to the family’ and are engrained from that point on were very much in the NTA camp. 
What’s funny is that almost every wedding I’ve been to someone throws out the ‘welcome to the family’ kind of comment but it is all just bollocks really. Hardly anyone really means that and save to say, most posters here don’t seem to think that is actually the case.

20933,No A-holes here,"A bit of a weird situation, thought I’d ask for Reddit’s wise guidance. 

So me (29M) and my wife (28F) have been married for a little over a year now. I was born and raised here in the U.S., while she grew up in my parents’ home country. Our marriage was quasi-arranged (our specific sub-community back home is quite small, so it’s pretty common for those who grow up in the West to “match” with people back home). For the most part, everything is really wonderful and we’re even expecting a child later this year! 

But recently, there’s been tension around chores in the house. She insists on doing things like the laundry, dishes, cleaning, cooking to the point where she gets actively annoyed if I try and do them, no matter how tired she is. Her argument is basically that, because I do the more traditionally “male” tasks like mowing the lawn, fixing appliances, washing the car, etc. it’s perfectly fair if she does the more traditionally “female” tasks around the house.

This reached a boiling point last night. She works in the medical field so she’s usually quite exhausted when she comes back from work. I offered to do the dishes after dinner, and she pushed me aside to do them herself, and literally wouldn’t let me help. I snapped and said “This is the kind of antiquated BS my parents came here to leave behind. I don’t want to be raising our kids and filling their head with this nonsense.” I also spoke about how I didn’t want us to become like her parents (who are very traditional). 

She got really upset that I snapped, and accused me of insulting her parents and our home country’s culture and having a superiority complex because I grew up in the US. She said that it’s just how she grew up and that it’s weird for me to be mad about it because she doesn’t mind doing the work at all. I understand that she’s just trying to be a helpful and kind person, but this just seems like a very weird and toxic attitude to me.

278,Asshole,"Wait! My fiancé loves being called a whore, slut, etc. Don't castrate me. 

Me(24M) and my fiancé(24F) are staying in the guest house near her parents house, as they want her to stay close during the *situation*.

While we were at home (her parents' guest house), my fiancé decided she wanted to initiate sexy time. Like right then, while I was in the middle of playing a video game. She wouldn't let me get to a checkpoint. You see, it's very difficult to play while someone is kissing your neck/trying to bite you. I kept telling her give me, like, two more minutes, but I don't know what porno she just finished watching to *this* needy. Whatever, I blew the game and was being rather rough with her when her mom called. She got off me mid kiss to go answer the phone, and basically her mom said food was ready, come over right now etc. We were mildly annoyed as we put our clothes back on, but we didn't start fucking so no harm no foul.

Fast forward to when we're eating dinner, I'm still mildly annoyed we didn't get to start, and I decide to return the favor of her distracting me by pinching her thigh when her parents aren't paying attention. Shes into it, don't worry. We finished eating and her mom takes everyone's plates and her dad went to the living to watch some desi movie, idk. So while everyone's back is turned she thinks it's a good idea to try to slip her hand up my shirt. We're both playing, keep in mind. I push her hand and her elbow bumps into the table while I say ""God, you're *such* a whore."" I guess it was louder than intended because both of her parents heads *snap* towards me.

I almost had a heart attack, I swear.

We were having fun, but from her parents perspective, all they hear is *painful thump* you're such a whore!

Yeah, I understand why they kicked me out.

Her dad yelled at me, how dare I call his daughter that in *his* house. Her mom was cursing me in her native language, and though I didn't understand I knew enough curse words to know she was *mad*.

My fiancé was telling them to calm down but her parents were not having it. Her parents are brown, we can't just explain to them that she likes being called a whore, she'll call us crazy. Her dad yelled at me to gtfo, I didn't wanna piss him off more so I left and she stayed and later told me she was trying to make up some scenario on that spot to why that would be acceptable but her parents weren't having it.

I went ""home"" and I get like 7 text messages from my fiancé saying that I'm an idiot, why would I do that *in front* of her parents, her mom is gossiping to all of her sisters etc. I didn't feel bad then because I knew we were fine but it's the next day and her parents aren't letting her see me and I feel bad now. I didn't mean for them to hear but they did and they're furious with me.

2 months pass and the same couple comes back, sits in my section. Before I went to greet them, another server warned me that they never tip, so don’t even bother giving them good service. I called their bluff and still gave them the best service I could, I’m talking giving them refills, to-go cups, asking them if they wanted dessert, all of that. They didn’t tip. This happens 4-5 more times. They started coming in twice a week and everyone refused to take them, so I get stuck with them. It got to the point where all I did was give them silverware and drinks.

19934,Asshole,"For a little backstory, my parents were both 19 when I was born. They'd split up while my mom was pregnant and my mom didn't even let me see my dad until I was 13. She also didn't contact him herself or ask him for child support during that time. He spent some of that time in prison for possession of marijuana. When I met him, he'd moved on and had a new girlfriend.

My parents had a huge falling out when I was 15, around the time my dad's girlfriend had my baby brother. And she took him to court for child support and won.

It's been almost 10 years. My dad now has a steady job for the first time in his life. He and his girlfirend broke up, after they had another kid, my baby sister. And my mom's getting a bunch of back child support because the state is garnishing his wages.

She started complaining how they didn't garnish his tax return this year as well, like they did last year. I told her that she shouldn't be so greedy because he's fighting for custody of my brother and sister, both under 10, and he's been struggling to pay his rent. She said ""good for him. Look at all the years I suffered with you"". I lost my temper and yelled at her about how she shouldn't want anyone to have a hard time the way we did and I think it's horrible that she'd ever think that it's good for anyone to struggle with money and she should tell the court to stop making my dad pay back child support because I'm in my 20s and it's not like she needs it anymore. I told her that it was her fault that my dad was struggling with money to begin with, which was stretching the truth a bit, and that she shouldn't be making my brother and sister pay for whatever mistakes my dad made with her and that they could be living a better life if she'd just back off.

I know my yelling probably crossed the line. But AITA for telling my mom she shouldn't be so happy to get child support when it's one of the reasons my dad is struggling financially?

Edit to add: A lot of you are saying from a financial situation, my mother deserves the money. And I understand that. Even with help from my grandparents, we weren't in the best position when I was my brother and sister's age. But she's doing much better now and has an income. She doesn't need the money right now. And I know the money from taxes hasn't come in yet. My dad's tax preparer let him know that he would be getting his whole return this year and it wouldn't be garnished. He let her know when he found out so that she wouldn't expect anything. She's been complaining about it for a few weeks, I guess.

6132,Not the A-hole,"So my gf and I have been together for almost 2 years. I'm an atheist but she comes from a very Christian family. She has always been cool with me being atheist and I don't have a problem with her religion.
However her family is totally different. Every time we visit they force me to go to church, force me to say grace,...
I have told them multiple times that I'm not going to convert to Christianity but they don't want to hear any of it.
So up until now I've just been stomaching in because I don't want to start too much drama with her family, and we don't see them that often anyways.
So a few weeks ago we visited them for 3 days. Like usual they started shoving Christianity down my throat. I already had a tough week before that and I just had enough of their bs
So it was dinner time and they asked me to say grace. I said no but like usual they said we won't eat until I say it. So I just snap. I go and say something among the lines of ""thank you sky daddy for giving food to us and not the starving children in Africa""
So obviously they were steaming. They told me to get out of their house. I drove back home but my gf stayed.
So now I haven't spoken to them at all. My gf said she needed some time as she didn't think I could be this disrespectful towards their religion. Everyone except my best friend and my family is standing with her.
So AITA for standing up for myself?

962,Everyone Sucks,"My roommate moved in about a year ago. He is 27 years old and was living with his aunt before us and he was really depressed living with her (or at least that is what my husband told me.) We wanted him to get back on his feet so when he asked to live with us it seemed like it wouldn't be a problem because the 3 of us had already lived together in the past before my husband and I got married.

But I thought he was only going to live with us a few month so after a year I asked him to start looking for a new place in like march of this year, and gave him three months to move out. 

In that three month he went behind my back and asked my husband if he could stay longer and my husband said yes and didnt tell me. So 3 months goes by and I'm like WTF? So I give him an extension by another month, and HE DOES THE SAME THING AGAIN. Talks to my husband behind my back and is like ""hey it would be so great if we could wait until the end of the year because I'm trying to buy a house"" (mind you he hasn't even talked to a lender at this point and I think he is moving out in 2 weeks.
So I find out that my husband told him that was ok AGAIN and I'm pissed so I'm like no. And give him one more extension because 2 weeks isnt enough to move after my husband made him think he could stay.
So I have given this man like 3/4 extensions and started asking him to move out 6 months ago and this man is still in my house on the 2nd of the next month. So I flipped out and threatened to charge him a hundred bucks for every day that he is still in my house so he moved out imediately.

16882,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway.

I've been with my boyfriend for a bit over a year, and he's really great and things have been awesome. But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. 

We have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.

I want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. 

I would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. 

He became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. 

So I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?

His logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. 

My logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. 

I'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are ""just what happen at strip clubs"".

He also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing.

2528,Not the A-hole,"In early July, I (19F) started babysitting for a man (40+M). After the first time I meet him and I finish babysitting, he started talking to me about how he’s going through a divorce and his kids don’t know about it yet. I felt really bad for him so I listen to him for 30min after I was supposed to leave. Apparently his wife had left him about a month prior. He included a lot of personal details that I won’t mention. I understood he was going through a separation and he probably didn’t have anyone to vent to.

I continue to babysit for him for the next month, and the more I do, the more casual he gets with me, talking to me every time I come over and mentioning that I’m like a friend to him. He also talked about taking me out to dinner as “friends.” I laughed it off but I didn’t really confirm as I felt it was a little inappropriate. He also complimented me excessively. At some point he even asked me how the single life was, since he was single now. Well again I passed it off as him going through a lot.

He would also start texting conversations that would turn self-deprecating or difficult to respond to (ex. buying 1 thing at store “It’s kinda sad that’s all I had to do on a Saturday night.”) He would also use terms of endearment for me. He has called me are Angel, sweetheart, his “saving grace,” etc. It made me uncomfortable but he never attempted to do anything so I brushed it off as me being paranoid. 

Well at the end of July my grandma passed away. This was obviously very emotional for me and I informed him that I would be unable to babysit that week due to this. He sent me a very long, thoughtful message that did mean a lot to me as it was extremely heartfelt. He would pop in with a message every few days that was kind. One of these messages included the line: “you are not only beautiful but you have a beautiful soul as well.” 

Later he said he and the kids want to buy me dinner as a back to college gift. I said that’s fine (since the kids would be there). A few days later he asked if I was in town, which I was not, so I said that I was not in town, sorry. He replied with: “Ok gorgeous. I was wondering when we could go to dinner.”

At this point I realized how weird his messages really were with all of his compliments and just didn’t reply. He messaged me a week after saying he hopes I’m doing okay. Then in the beginning of September he sent me a long text apologizing for if he made me uncomfortable, he was going through an emotional time, and wishing me the best, mentioning again about how he and the kids want to take me out for dinner. Again I did not reply because I was uncomfortable, but I felt very guilty for not doing so. He never tried anything with me in person so I don’t know if I’m making a big deal out of this or not.

Moving to the matter itself, every year, my hosts a large Halloween party. Usually, there are around two hundred guests in attendance. For a variety of reasons, my parents are unable to host the event this year, and they asked me to do so in their stead.

They said it would be fine. Earlier today, my mother called me. I had emailed her the menu and guest list for final approval. She was furious. 

Apparently, I was unclear when I said I was uncomfortable. My parents thought that when I agreed, I agreed to serve meat and alcohol. They are saying it will be a huge issue at the party.

He did say we can take it off of her when we are in the room with her and can watch her but said the more we keep it on the more she will get used to it.

The dog hates the cone and when we first got her home she tried to pull it off and then refused to lay down, just stood by her bed for 20 minutes looking pissed off. My wife felt really sorry for her so took it off and said she would watch her, I  want to keep it on as much as possible. I put it on her and go on about my day and every time I come back my wife has taken it off because she feels bad.

I lost it, yelled at my wife for being irresponsible and not doing the dog any favors. I told her she was being the exact opposite of loving and kind to the dog. Sometimes being tough is the kind thing to do (keeping the cone on the dog even though she hates it and it looks uncomfortable). I really went off. My wife was crying that she didn't do it on purpose, she was just taking a quick shower, she thought it would be OK. I am really pissed off.

We went outside and she got very upset with me, saying I embarrassed her in front of the cashier and that I was being rude.

14206,Everyone Sucks,"Sorry for the formatting. I’m on mobile. 

   
  My partner (20M) and I (19F) have a three month old son. He is formula fed, which means that we always have to be well stocked up. 

   Last night, when we went to bed, I noticed that we only had half a can left (enough to make it through the night/into the morning). I mentioned this to my partner, and asked if he could go in the morning to pick some more up. He said yes, and left it at that. This morning, he made a bottle around 11. I asked him again if he could go pick up more formula, he said “sure, I’m just going to hang out for a bit and then I’ll head out.”

   Fast forward to 1:30pm. My partner left the house at 1:15 to get formula. Our son wakes up from his nap absolutely screaming his head off. He was so hungry. I had to wait for 30 minutes for my partner to get back from the store. I’m livid, and I express my irritation by saying “Hey, I need you to be more diligent with making sure that we have enough formula. If you see the can is empty, we need to make sure we have more before the next time the baby is ready to eat.” 

   Then he just got pissed at me, saying things like “it’s not like I’ve never had to be patient with you”.

2222,Not the A-hole,"Hi everyone,

I (28M) am making this post because I really don't know what to do. My girlfriend (22F) is my first girlfriend in life. And I don't know if some things are just normal for a relationship to work or if some are just out of line. 

So I received a seasonal gift from my three young staffers at work. This is just a tradition in my country at this time of the year where young people pay their respects to elders (or in my case some kind of mentors). These three girls gifted me two bottles of instant crystallized coffee and a wallet. So I mentioned that to my girlfriend and she wanted me to give her the wallet. To some extent, I can understand her feelings. She also said it out loud to me: she doesn't like the fact that I keep a gift coming from a group of girls. So then I told her that I would get rid of the wallet on my own. Maybe I will donate it to someone. Or regift it to someone. But she couldn't accept it. She would like to have it and get rid of it by herself because she didn't trust me. Then I started to get a little bit mad. It is one thing that I do whatever I want with the said wallet or any other gift that I get. But it seems insulting to the people who give the present that my girlfriend can take over their gift to me and do as she pleases. So for now, I told my girlfriend that we would talk about it later. Maybe she is getting mad at me right now. But I don't want to talk about this whole thing at the moment. 

So please judge my case. Don't hold any punches. Let me know if I am the one who is unreasonable. As I said above, this is my first relationship, and I don't know which things are something I need to work on or which are the ones I have to put my foot down.",98,298,0.94,AITA for refusing to handover my girlfriend a present that I get from my female staffers?,di9aqs,2019-10-15 15:13:51,NTA,1714,AITA
8696,No A-holes here," 

This is kind of light, but I am genuinely perplexed by the way this whole thing unfolded, and that kind of worries me. I'm really concerned at the possibility that if I'm this puzzled by these people's reactions, it could be reflective of some deeply ingrained assholery in my personality. This could be elevated stage assholism I'm dealing with here, and I need to know how to proceed.

Here's what happened:

LI beaches, like other crowded beaches, have an issue with theft. Not a terrible one, but the possibility is always there, and it would be foolish to ignore it. As I unpacked my stuff and prepared to hit the surf for an hour or so, I secreted my valuables into my sneakers and stashed them as best I could. I looked around at my now rapidly multiplying neighbors and felt a twinge of paranoia, which impelled me to turn to the people nearest me, a kindly looking couple in their 30's, and introduce myself.

""Hi, um, excuse me.""

The woman looked up.

""Do you guys think you could just, you know, keep an eye on my stuff while I go swimming? I won't be long, it's just that, uh, I'm here by myself and all...""

An uncomfortable moment of silence passed.

""It's not a lot of stuff, just my phone and keys and some other things.""

At this point the guy she was with grumbled something inaudible in her ear, and I was starting to feel like this wasn't going well. After a few more agonizing beats the woman still had not answered me.

I now wanted nothing more than to just get the fuck away from there, so I started making toward the water, but not before saying, ""Is that okay?""

Finally she responded, ""Yeah sure, will there be anything else?"" The notes of sarcasm were not lost on me.

Awkwardness achieved, I desperately wanted to break into a flat out sprint away from this exchange, but instead I just croaked out something like, ""YeahnothanksandI'llwatchyourstoobye."" And I sauntered off, another cringe inducing social situation under my belt.

Okay, looking back on it, what I probably *should* have said was, ""Hey guys, just letting you know that this is my stuff and if you see anyone else going through it they don't belong there."" Instead, I guess I kind of came off in a very forward and even unwelcome way, where I was essentially enlisting two strangers to do my bidding when all they wanted to do was just enjoy *their* time at the beach. But it's not like I was asking for an armed sentry post or anything, I figured it was just a common courtesy. But that's what bugs me, as I said before the fact that I feel like this was ""no big deal"" could be emblematic of me being an entitled asshole. And I never did ascertain what the guy grumbled into his ladyfriend's ear, but if it was in keeping with the tone of the rest of the conversation I think it's more than likely that *he* was being an asshole as well.

Whatever the case, I learned a lesson in tact that day, though there's still a pretty significant part of me that feels like I didn't really need one. So reddit, AITA?

18916,Not the A-hole,"My two year old son is at an age where everyone wants to touch him and pinch him. 

My wife and I agreed we wouldn’t force our kids to hug or kiss anyone because we want to teach appropriate physical boundaries and ownership of your body from an early age. 

Recently my grandmother visited and when she was leaving my sister directed my son to “give Grammy a kiss goodbye” and he said “don’t want to” and we said “that’s fine, wave goodbye then.” And he waved and said goodbye. 

She started to say “oh, no kiss for Grammy?” But I shut that down with “(son) has a lot of ways to express his feelings” and we left it at that. She seemed to understand. 

My sister took her to the airport but when she was over later she said I was an asshole for not having my son kiss his great grandmother goodbye knowing it meant something to her just because he “didn’t want to”. 

I tried to explain not wanting physical touching isn’t the same as not wanting to leave the park or whatever, but she said it’s not as big a deal to him to give her a quick kiss as it was for her to feel her great grandson didn’t treasure her visit.

14515,Not the A-hole,"I live with my 25 year old sister and her two little girls 4 and 2. She recently started a job that is 2-6 pm and I’ve been watching them on my days off work. Here’s some background info to better understand the situation. 
 
I work 4-6 days a week usually all day. But I always work Saturdays and Sundays all day. She does not, she has those days off. She does not pay me for watching the children and I do not receive anything in return for doing the favor of watching her children. 

She got her job in January and since then when I watch them I usually clean up after them. They always make a mess with their toys and always spill their food. But I don’t mind the cleaning cause I might as well since I live here too. But I would always tell them when they made a mess to clean up after themselves. I’m trying to teach them good habits here. So on saturdays and sundays when I come home from work the house is always a mess. ALWAYS. Dishes are in the sink, there are toys everywhere, spilled juice is still on the floor, cracker dust is all on the couch. A mess and I’m tired so I try my best and clean up what I can. I’ve told my sister plenty of times that she needs to start telling them clean up after themselves. They start learning habits at this age and it gets kind of annoying when I have to tell them 10 times to pick up a toy. But she ignores me when I tell her that and doesn’t discipline them at all. 

So two weeks ago my sister went on vacation for a week. Before she left I cleaned the house spotless. Not a crumb in sight. And that entire week I made sure to have everything so clean you could eat food of the floor. The night they came back my nieces made a mess. Toys EVERYWHERE. Shredded cheese throughout the hall. And all of their luggage and clothing spread throughout the dining room. Again that night I told them to clean up after themselves. The next few days my sister had no work cause she came back on Friday and had Saturday and Sunday to chil. Well I worked all day Saturday Sunday and then Monday. In those 3 days my sister did not clean a thing. I get maybe she was tried from traveling but after having 2 days of chillin like can’t you at least broom? I know she hasn’t cleaned at all because we have this card game and she gave it to them to play with, which I have told her before to NOT give to them because they always throw the cards everywhere and we can never find all of them. That card game was still all over the floor in those three days she did not attempt to even pick them up. 

I feel like she is expecting me to clean because I’ve always cleaned up after them. But none of that is my mess and she had been home she could have cleaned. So for right now it’s now been almost a week and the living room, dining room, and kitchen are all a mess and I’m not planning on cleaning it anytime soon. I feel like she needs to clean up after them mainly cause she was watching them and they are her kids.

I didn't want him worrying about balancing a crazy work schedule and school, as he's struggled with school before, plus I am in my final year and only taking 2 classes per semester while he is in 13 credit hours. 

When we moved in, the expectations were that he would clean the apartment when home since he will only be working 3 days a week, 4 or 5 hour shifts. I work 5 days a week and work 7-8 hour shifts depending on the week and hour budget. I sometimes have to close at work and open at 7am the next morning.

We got into a huge argument today. He stated that if we were going to equally divide finances, he refuses to do any house work because at that point he is, in his eyes, equally contributing. I said that was BS, as he's home far more than I am and spends most of his free time out with friends or playing games, and I expected the house to be livable and cleaned since he spends MOST of his day here. I have been the one cleaning the kitchen, doing laundry, putting it away, moving things around, etc. for the entire time we've been here (even though he's been unemployed), so I guess I shouldn't be surprised that he doesn't want to contribute cleanliness.

I conceded and said okay, I'll pay half of rent, electricity, and internet, but will need you to pick up more than half of the groceries bc I also have a car payment and health insurance I have to pay for on my own. His car and health insurance is paid by his parents. He said fine, but he still will not do housework. 

I am beyond mad. I feel like all of the responsibility of the house and finances have fallen on me even though we agreed that he'd take care of cleaning since he's the one with more time available to do so. I either suck it up and pay the vast majority of our joint bills, and maybe potentially have a clean home, or work full time go to school and clean a shared living space while my partner sits and plays games.

Tl;dr: I am working full time and going to school so my partner can work part time and focus on his education. We agreed, before moving in, that he would do the housework since he was home more. Now he's arguing that sharing bills is equal contribution and I will have to clean the house if I want it cleaned, even after 40 hour work weeks and my own classes. I'm working so he doesn't have to and now I feel like the financial AND household duties are all on my shoulders.

If I could choose, I wouldn't even go to the stupid thing. As far as I am concerned, this is just another money grab by my university. I graduated Summa Cum Laude, got a very good job offer in my field, and used very little of my parents money to do so.

To be honest, graduating college was always the bare minimum expected of me, and finally doing so is basically just a ""you didn't fuck up"" type of thing.

We are very lucky that her parents will pay for the wedding, albeit the guest list must be very small, for cost reasons. The guest list is 20 people, with no +1’s, again, to keep the cost down. Also, This park has a policy that if you bring more than the anticipated guest count, they can and will cancel your wedding on the spot.

He wants to bring her to at least the rehearsal dinner, which again, I said no. (Isn’t the rehearsal dinner supposed to be even more exclusive than the wedding anyways?)

I listed the following reasons:

-My in-laws are paying for the wedding, I don’t want to spend more of their money.
-I can’t even invite some of my closest friends because of the size of the wedding, why should his girlfriend be prioritized over my closest friends who I call family.
-it’s disrespectful to my mom who has lived alone and has not fully recovered from their divorce about 2 years ago. So this would cause a lot of drama and upset my mom, who has done nothing but support me, even when she had nothing.

9754,Not the A-hole,"Background on my condition: 

I have narcolepsy, a condition characterized by excessive sleepiness where your brain is constantly on the edge of REM sleep because my brain doesn’t produce the chemicals it needs to make me feel awake. Even with a good night’s sleep, I’m basically functioning as if I haven’t slept in 2 days. I experience constant tiredness, have hallucinations when I go to sleep and wake up, and can have sleep attacks where I basically can’t keep my head up.

I manage it pretty well. I take Concerta (time-release Adderall that serves as a stimulant) and try to get as much sleep as possible. But it’s still a daily factor in my life. My ex-boyfriend was really great with me. If I got too tired, we’d go home. If I had an occasional bad day health-wise, he’d be patient and even get me food or groceries because I’d be too tired to leave the house. Since he woke up before me, he’d wake me up, remind me to take my meds, and let me go back to sleep so I could wake up with them already active. Even though my ex was great (broke up because of circumstances), I can function fine by myself. He was just a support system. 



Recently, I matched with someone on Tinder and we got talking. We were supposed to go out for drinks tomorrow night but he mentioned that he has narcolepsy. I thought that was kind of cool that there are other people near me with the condition because it’s pretty rare but realized that I could not, under any circumstances, get romantically involved with another narcoleptic.

It’s just one date, but on the chance that we ended up really liking each other, I didn’t want to risk it. My narcolepsy is a huge burden in my daily life and I know how it feels to be constantly tired, occasionally agoraphobic, and definitely helpless on some days. If I end up with someone, I’d like that support system again and to be able to support them in whatever they need as well. But I just don’t want to have narcolepsy take over even more of my life. I’m totally aware a first date is very low commitment but I figured it’d be nicer to cut it off ahead of a meeting to not waste his time.

I sent him the following message: “I appreciate your honesty but I’m also narcoleptic. You seem like an awesome guy but I don’t think it’s a good idea to go out with someone who also has narcolepsy. Two sleepy people can be trouble! I hope you understand and I’m really sorry about this.”

He replied with a whole string of messages saying that I was prejudiced against the disabled and I need to learn how to be more open-minded. 

I considered my line of thinking as logical and genuinely didn’t want to hurt his feelings. Also, I’m confused on how I’m being prejudiced because I have the same condition he has.

18289,Not the A-hole,"I moved in with my boyfriend 2 months ago. We live in a condominium where the majority are people over the age of 50. (However I have seen some couples our age - 30ish).

Today we received a letter on our door that states the following -

*in respect to know you have neighbors. Could you please 1. Avoid stomping (heavy walking) of all hours of the day/night. 2. Place a carpet under your workout equipment. 3. Heavily moving chairs in the kitchen. 4. Appreciate your neighbours . This has been going on for months and unless you don't comply I will need to take the necessary actions with condo company. Thank you. P. S - I Can even hear you having sex... She's a lucky girl.*

1. I can with confidence say we don't stomp. I'm 5'3 125 pounds. Boyfriend is 6'1 close to 200. We don't run around or dance or jump. We literally walk normally from the couch to the bathroom to the bedroom etc.

2. We don't even own any workout equipment! We don't workout whatsoever.

3. Heavily moving kitchen chairs? We use bar stools at the island to eat dinner and we use them literally once a day - to eat dinner. And we don't aggressively pull them.

4. With the sex. Fine. Maybe we can be a bit loud because of the bed moving? But we're not smacking each around and jumping. However this is something we agreed that we could be a little quieter doing? Which then interrupts our sex life but we'll do it to ""appreciate the neighbours"".

We both can honestly say we don't do anything worthy of the things accused in this note. If I were to try to ""tone down"" everything on here then I'd literally be tip toeing around, literally picking up the bar stool to pull in and out and being in bed by 7pm to avoid late noise. The *only* thing I can think of us recently we bought some stuff to improve the condo like floor lamps and had to put it together... But that was in the middle of the day and in the note it even says ""avoid heavy walking of hours of the day/night"" and today we're building standing cabinets for the kitchen but it's only 5 pm... Not like we're doing these things at 11pm or something.

So WIBTA if I just... Ignored this note and continued doing how we've been living? (again, we can try to tone down the sex?) but in my opinion I find this note a little ridiculous however not sure if I'm the asshole. Also there is no unit number to which it came from so we don't even know who sent it.

Edit - boyfriend also works like 9 hour days. Two weeks of the month his shift is 330pm-1230am and gets home at 1am but again he isn't barging in through the door making a rucus. He'll heat up some food, sit on the couch watch a bit of tv and go to bed. And the times he's at work it's literally just me chilling on my laptop at home.

Edit - we own a large carpet that covers the living room floor. We don't have the extra income for rugs (rugs are expensive!) and even still the condo is pretty small so we don't have anywhere to put them that wouldn't look ridiculous or out of place. We DON'T walk around with shoes on ever and even if we did itd be to just quickly use the bathroom before leaving for the day and we own NO workout equipment.

8518,Asshole,"A couple of months ago, I ran into some legal trouble, and I needed one of my incredible close friend's help to write me a letter of good character. I was still in a bit of shock from what happened, and I impulsively texted her out of the blue saying ""need you to draft a letter for me for good character. Need it by Friday thanks so much"" and she responded with ""you need to ask before you demand something of someone."" 

I immediately apologized with ""my bad I'm sorry. I still think you're the goat."" She agreed to write the letter, but kept on saying ""I'll write your letter today"" or ""I have an exam today/tomorrow but afterwards I'll write it."" She did this multiple times. She slowly stopped communicating, and the letter ended up never being written. She continued to post on all social media of her going out to bars/parties while not communicating with me whatsoever.

Eventually I reached out to one of our mutual friends to see what was going on. The mutual friend said that I never ""asked nor apologized correctly"" to the close friend. 

I ended up texting the close friend, saying ""I’m not mad but I’m pretty disappointed. I don’t mean to sound like a parent, but you really let me down with this letter. I understand that you’ve had exams, but you’ve also had two weeks notice. It takes maybe an hour out of your day to write this. If you were in my shoes and you asked me to write a letter, I would’ve dropped everything to do it. The fact that you post on your private Twitter, finsta, and private snap story and don’t provide some sort of communication to me doesn’t help.

19114,Not the A-hole,"EDIT: THE EVIL HAS BEEN DEFEATED!
I had a meeting today with the owner of the third-party company, and while he didn't buy it right away, his partner was appalled when I gave them my phone to read the texts. The supervisor has been removed, and they promised me he'll be fired as well so he can't tarnish the company further.
Today we won!

Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

So I work in engineering, and I manage multiple projects, each one with one or more contractor companies. It's pretty standard practice to give contractors and key employees my phone number, so I can contact them. The job requires a lot of on the fly decisions, and that way they can text me with whatever is wrong and I can get started on solving it.

I also don't have a company phone, so I'm left using my personal phone for work. It sucks a bit because that makes me available 24/7, but usually people are considerate and at least apologize if they are texting late at night about work.

Tuesday night I started getting a number of texts from a field supervisor from a third-party company. They were very inappropriate.

I replied that I was very uncomfortable with the conversation, and stopped replying. The guy briefly apologized, then resumed texting. Honestly, he sounded drunk from the nonsensical things typed between ""compliments"". He also started calling my phone non-stop.

 

Later I went to talk to my manager, that I wasn't comfortable working with the supervisor (I often am alone at the factory with contractors while we inspect machines and installations), and that I'd like to remove him from the team (in theory, something I'd have authority to do).

My boss thought I was getting too worked up over nothing, admonished me to not care so much and told me that it's a normal thing to happen and that I should learn to deal with it, as it wouldn't be the last time. While I talked to him he was also smiling the whole time and even cracked a joke (""your fault for being pretty! haha"").

 

Today I have invited the owner of the third-party company here so I can talk to him. I want to have the supervisor removed. Despite that, I expect that his response will be in line with my boss' (they are longtime friends) and the supervisor will remain working here (""we don't want to shortstaff them during the project. It might be months before they can replace him, and by then the project is over, anyway"").

WIBTA if I went to HR anyway and told them what happened? I'm unsure if they can do anything at all since the supervisor is a contractor, but I don't feel safe and I don't know what to do.

4842,No A-holes here,"My mother has never had a real relationship with my father and I have seen him twice. At least that I can remember of. I love my mother more than anything and there is no bias involved towards my sister. I wanted my mother to find a good man she loves and when she did I encouraged her to get a child with him.

I was 20 when my sister was born. Her father sadly died few years after that and I was super glad that my mother still had my sister because I couldnt be there for her as much as I wanted to.

Now I never had a ""real"" relationship with my sister. I live rather far away so I just visit a few times a year, send gifts on special occasions etc.
I think that's why I dont really feel anything towards her. I wish her all the best and wouldn't ever wrong her, but I dont love her. I probably dont even like her. My mother on the other hand really, really wants us to have this amazing bond of big sister-little sister that love each other and so on. I feel terrible because I simply dont feel anything. I am closer in age to my mother than I am to my sister. I simply cant see how with this age gap and distance we can have a dream relationship. But I never said anything to my mother and always act like I love my sister and would do anything for her.

But I really want to spend time with my mother alone. My sister is 6 now, she is very social and doesnt really have an issue with staying with relatives or a baby sitter besides not having my moms attention. Still the only time we spent just the two of us when I visited is when she was asleep.

Now I got invited to a ceremony for top 500 apprentices in our region where I'll get a certificate and it's generally to honor the best of this year. I can bring two guests, so I decided to invite my mother and my bf.

I really dont want my sister to be there. She is a kid and she doesnt know how to behave properly and needs all the attention there is. It's not her fault, but I want this to be about me for once and not about ""Look what your sister accomplished"".

Also I am moving to a new flat soon and my mother offered to help me, but now she also wants to have my sister there even though we will be working on the flat all the time and I really dont see how painting and taking care of a child so that she doesnt do anything bad with said paint, glue etc is a good idea.

I feel like an asshole that I dont want to have my sister at the ceremony and think about declining the invitation, look for an excuse for my mother and not going alltogether.

They said there was a reward of $500 for finding their lost cat. So I caught the cat, which was pretty easy since he was friendly, and checked a poster to see if it was him - it was.

I went home, put him in the back porch, and called the number on the poster to let them know I found their cat. They were happy that I found him and said they could come pick him up right away. I confirmed that there was a $500 reward, texted the guy a picture of the cat, and gave him my address.

This is where the problem started. When he got to my house, I asked for the reward money before returning the cat. He said that there actually isn't a reward and that he only advertised one to increase the chance that people would look for his cat. I told him that I wasn't going to give his cat back until he paid the promised reward and that he shouldn't have posted one if he didn't want to pay one.

3707,Not the A-hole,"I grew up in a very crowded house, as in 9 people living in a 3 bedroom, plus regular overnight guests. The house was always cluttered as a result, and we were poor as it is. I've always been deeply introverted, so this was hell on earth. I promised myself as a kid that when I had my own place, it would be my sanctuary and purely for me, myself and I and that I didn't want anyone in my space.

I'm now in my 30s and kept my promise to myself, and barring visits from close family I never have company over, it's bliss. However, about a month ago my brother (26) had a break-up and was kicked out of his apartment, so putting family over my own hang-ups I invited him to stay with me for a few weeks until he gets back on his feet. I was fine with this. Take note that he doesn't pay rent, buy his own groceries, etc. He's here for free, using my utilities and has free access to the food until he leaves. Guest, not tenant.

We're now having a conflict because he's been trying (and in two instances, actually going ahead and doing it) to invite his friends over to my place. The first time, I came home from work to see him and his friend sitting in the living room. I asked his friend to leave, and told my brother he knows how I feel about my space, and that he had no right to invite someone over without asking. He apologized, until the next day where he began a trend of nagging/complaining that he wants to be able to have his friends over, making a variety of excuses/justifications and compromises such as they'll stay in his guest room, they'll only be over for a little while, they'll be respectful and so on. These conversations might happen 3 times per day, everyday, for the past week. Each time I refuse.

Fast forward to this thursday. I once again come home to hear my brother talking to someone in my home gym and listen. He has two friends over working out. I again kick them both out immediately. This leads to a major argument where my brother calls me an asshole, tells me that he's going through a hard time and doesn't feel ready to go out anywhere and socialize yet due to distress from his break-up, so he wants to invite friends to come over for support and socialization since he ""needs it right now"", and that there's ""no reason for me to have a problem with it since he can have them over when I'm out so they don't bother me.""

My argument is that it's my home, and I don't want anyone I don't personally care for inside of it. I don't want them on my furniture, using my stuff, sitting on my toilet, drinking from my glasses. It makes me uncomfortable, and that should be enough. I told him it's my house, not a support group, and that he's staying rent-free as a guest and has no right to go over my head. I told him nothing stops him from going to their house or meeting elsewhere if he wanted to.

He refused to drop it, so I told him that he has another week to find an apartment for himself. I know I'm a (very content) recluse, but am I an asshole?

6492,No A-holes here,"My sister moved out 2 months ago but is visiting right now so it wont be an issue again. But I’m curious about whether I’m justified in feeling like she is TA here. I stream on twitch as a part time job, it makes me some money and I don’t make a lot of money at my regular job. I also consider it a huge passion and hobby off mine. Back when she lived here, she lived on a floor above me in our house and always claimed she could hear me stream late into the night. 

She’d bang on my door during streams, send me aggressive texts, and even stomp on the floor above. It was embarrassing to have my viewers witness it so I would always log off my streams early and eventually I gave up streaming. Take in mind my sister has supersonic hearing and she freaks out at the sound of a bathroom DOOR lightly clicking shut at nighttime and gets up and causes a scene about small noises all the time. For example weekend when everyone was up at 11 am having breakfast on the kitchen shed be screaming from her room that she’s trying to sleep. 

When she moved out I finally got a chance to get back into it. However because of her wedding festivities and other family visiting I didn’t get to this summer. This week I finally got to stream again. I work full time so weekends are my only days to stream. I streamed last night for the first time in FOREVER and it was an amazing stream. I requested beforehand to my sister that if she needed me to lower my voice she could text me and I’d go as low as I could, but that I am streaming and that’s that. She said fine. 

I had a good stream with tons of hosts, raids, new followers and subscribers. Really really good for my twitch to grow. I was having a blast for ONCE doing something I loved. It was a 10 pm to 2 am stream. People who go on twitch know that streams are on average 3-5 hour. 

But, she didn’t listen to my request and kept aggressively texting me many times throughout the night to lower my volume and to just stop streaming. She knocked on my door hella hard at one point so I had to mute my stream for a while. the  later she stomped super hard on the floor above a BUNCH of times.  

Finally I texted her “I’m getting off stream, happy? Don’t be a psycho. This is my house, not yours.” 

I feel mean for calling it my house not hers bc she moved out of state and I know she misses being here a lot too. But shes leaving in 2 days and has her own apartment to be quiet and comfortable in forever. She can’t accommodate for ONE night on a Saturday for my hobby? *I* live here. Its *my* weekend when she doesn’t even work! And my parents and other sister literally DO NOT hear my voice or get bothered by it even though their rooms are just as close. The game volume is in my headset. There is only the noise of my voice. 

AITA for streaming late? I did do my best to make my voice as low as possible and keep my mouth close to the mic. I guess I strongly feel like she’s TA for making something I love so miserable for me even though it’s my house too.",42,28,0.86,AITA for streaming till 2 am even though it disturbs my sisters sleep?,cp0ny1,2019-08-11 18:52:15,NAH,3011,AITA

Enter lady with four kids: A newborn, two toddlers, and a kindergarten aged kid (little girl in question here). She really really should have brought an iPad or a second adult or something because her kids were literally running around this tiny ass space, yelling and screeching. The mom was oblivious to all of her kids except the newborn, who was quietly breastfeeding while mom was glued to her phone screen. Accordingly, other people were put in the awkward position of having to discipline her kids. Several people had previously tried to put her kids back in line for whatever issue (harassing their kids, being loud, whatever).

Her kindergarten aged daughter, who clearly had some kind of special needs, was absolutely enamored with my newborn and his stroller. She was asking me if she could push it around (no) she was getting super close to my newborn (stop) and was generally just being annoying. Ffs at one point when I wasn't looking and was preoccupied with my own kid, she went digging in my diaper bag and throwing my stuff onto the chair and the floor. My newborn was really fussy because we were there for a sick visit and he wasn't feeling well, and I DID NOT feel like entertaining some strange kid. 

I tried being polite about it ""Sweetie where's your mommy?"" -points to mom- ""Ma'am!"" -points to kid- The lady would call her kid back, but the kid just kept coming back to me. Rinse and repeat. I told her she needed to stay with her mom. Little punk deadass says ""I don't wanna"" and keeps trying to touch my son, my stroller, our stuff. 


Finally, I'm trying to fix a bottle of formula while holding a screaming baby and listening to this little girl like a broken record ""why is your baby crying? Why is your baby crying! make him stop! I don't like that"" And her and her annoying self knocks my bottle of formula off the table and into my stroller. So now I'm out formula, kid still screaming, and I have a huge mess that I don't have a great way to clean up. 

I'm at my wits end. I raise my voice at this kid. ""LOOK WHAT YOU DID. I AM NOT YOUR MOM, I AM NOT YOUR BABYSITTER. YOU ARE BOTHERING ME. GET OUT OF MY FACE!!"" 

People looked at me like I was the biggest bitch on earth. A lady speaking Spanish actually did call me a bitch. The little girl starts crying. I'm not apologizing. The mom confronts me, I tell her she should have been watching her kid and that's the hill I'm prepared to die on.

7914,No A-holes here,"I live in London and near one of the exits at a tube stop I frequent is a little cart owned by a woman who makes cute fancy cakes. I had never purchased from her before but had a rough day at work so I decided to treat myself. 

I was just reading the menu when a girl maybe in her 20s approached me and said excuse me. Honestly I couldn’t tell for sure if she was homeless or not. I looked at her and she didn’t say anything so I just went back to the menu. She said excuse me again so I said she could go before me if she was already ready to order. Then she said, “Actually I’m homeless and was wondering if you would get me a little cake.” 
I became super uncomfortable in that moment. 

Living in London, I’m used to being near homeless people. When they go car to car in the tube asking for money, I usually give them some because they’re always polite and it’s a gamble to spend money to ride the tube in hopes of getting more. 

But I was so uncomfortable with being approached by the girl in the middle of ordering my food and being asked if I could get her some as well. I felt like I was specifically targeted and trapped. (I get targeted for various reasons in the city regularly because I go places alone, I look much younger than my actual age, and I’m quite short and thin.) 

I ended up telling the cake lady maybe I’d come back another time and walking away from the situation. Obviously I wouldn’t tell the homeless girl I couldn’t buy her a cake and then turn to proceed to buy myself one, but I was completely turned off by how rude she was in her approach.

3947,Everyone Sucks,"I had to take a long bus ride today (~5 hours). 

Not the most comfortable thing but I’m doing some work and waiting it out. 

About halfway into the bus ride, some woman starts playing music aloud on a speaker. 

I figured it was an accident at first and she’d turn it off, but she doesn’t. 

She gets lots of irritated eye rolls and death glares from passengers. Someone even went up to the bus driver, but what could he do, he had to drive the bus.  She also had two kids with her so I think that kept away people who otherwise would’ve confronted her. 

I was hoping to take a nap before arriving at my destination and couldn’t drown out this sound. 

I went over and asked politely if she could turn that off and she said pretty evenly “no I can’t.” There was about five minutes of back and forth that can be best summarized as 
Me: You are bothering everybody and this is wildly inconsiderate 

Her: you don’t speak for everybody and my kids like the music. I paid for this bus seat and I can do what I want. 

So then I did something I’m not proud of. I took the speaker, put it in my briefcase, and set the combination lock. 

As a show of good faith, I gave her my briefcase to hang onto for the remainder of the trip, to be clear I was not trying to steal her speaker. I just said, very ticked off at this point “I’ll open it when we get there since you clearly aren’t responsible enough to handle a speaker.” 

They tried to get the bus driver involved but he basically said “stop bothering me while I’m driving or I’ll have to remove you.”

First, I don't think I am the right person for that since I no longer identify myself with Christianity. I have stopped going to church for a while now though still celebrate Christmas and Easter for their festivities

Second, being a godfather/godmother is such a huge responsibility that requires you to also be responsible in shaping the kid's spiritual growth by providing them with guidance and teachings in accordance with Christian belief, well at least that's how it is in my family. And I am pretty sure I can not do that. 

My brother was kind of upset when I suggested that he pick someone else. I even recommended my cousin who is a very religious person. But according to my family's tradition, you are expected to choose a sibling to be your children's godfather/godmother as opposed to asking someone else outside the main family circle. 
I could tell that he is so disappointed in me but I told him that I am honored and touched that he chose me, but I don't think I am the right person. 

My mother rang me up this morning to tell me that I am such an asshole for letting my brother down. And that I should call him and just go for it anyway because it is how it is done in the family just for the sake of it. I wouldn't have to be involved in his daughter's spiritual growth because of course 'You are an atheist now' according to her. She wants me to accept it as a mere formality as opposed to not only being an uncle but also a spiritual mentor or someone she looks up to spiritually.

She hasn’t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That’s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band.

18157,Not the A-hole,"I'm Irish. A decade ago I met Ex. 2 years in I got pregnant. We married, and when our daughter was born he let me pick her name, so I gave her a very Irish name. Fake name I'm using is Saoirse, and the real name is different but similarly Irish and hard to say unless you've heard it already.

Ex's mother (MIL) would ring once a week and come to Ireland a few times a year. I always ended up cooking/cleaning for her (she'd stay with us), and when she was on the phone Ex would say ""do you want to speak to OP?"" and I'd have to talk to her. I didn't like this because she hated me, as she was very anti-Irish, and anti-me by extension.

Eventually I told Ex that I was done with MIL. He and Saoirse can keep talking to her, but if she calls then don't put me on, and if she comes to visit she can get a hotel and they can go meet her.

A few years ago Ex and I began to have problems. Eventually he asked me for a divorce. The custody agreement we ended up with gave me majority custody, but he gets summer holidays and every other Christmas. He was moving back to England and asked if he could still have contact with Saoirse, so we worked out a schedule for him video calling once a week for 30 mins. He's remarried, his wife is pregnant, and the number of calls from him has been going down, which doesn't surprise me as it's a tricky pregnancy.

As he's been calling less MIL has been using his skype account to call us in the time slots he isn't using. Because it's a video call on my laptop I can hear everything, including MIL calling Saoirse by the name ""Sue"". I didn't say anything on the call but after I asked Saoirse if that was the first time MIL did that and Saoirse said that MIL gave her an ""English name"" but she didn't like it. I asked some follow ups and found out MIL also corrects her speech when she uses Irish dialect and asks her to tone down her accent.

I was fuming but didn't do anything until the next video chat where I heard MIL call her Sue, and then I asked Saoirse to go wash up, took her seat, and said ""you know her name is Saoirse, right?"" MIL says it's hard to pronounce. I say it's not and break it down to sounds (Sur-sha) for MIL. MIL says the English name is easier, and I say that's no use if it's wrong and told MIL that if I heard MIL call her ""Sue"" or correct her speech again then I'd reconsider this setup.

Next video call was last night, MIL immediately greets her as ""Sue"" I then pop my head in again and say ""I warned you"" before hanging up and blocking Ex's skype account.

I ignored the incoming video calls (she used her skype and her and Ex's facebooks) for the rest of the night. Today I woke up to several messages from Ex saying I shouldn't have hung up on MIL like that and I need to unblock the account, then call MIL and apologise. I had a bit of a moan to my cousin who was on my side until I told her I hung up on MIL and says I should apologise for that only.

AITA?

Info: MIL has 2 other children in her life, unsure of her relationship to them, but their names are Iona and Lachlan, both of which she pronounces fine, so this really isn't a case of my daughter's name being ""too hard"".

15241,Not the A-hole,"Back in May of 2017 I had a friend who met someone and started dating them within a couple weeks. One month after that they got engaged. Their wedding was set for September. But the Bride to be, the “friend”, wanted it moved to the weekend of August 19. It took place in Boise, Idaho. She had invited me, but I had my own plans. Plans that was 10 years in the making and came to fruition two days later (August 21, 2017). The day of the solar eclipse. 

I live in Florida; the friendship was through social media. In 2007 I learned about the 2017 eclipse and made the promise I would go see it on the path of totality. I even became a truck driver just to have that opportunity. The plan was to fly to Springfield, Missouri and drive to St. Joseph. Weather wasn’t looking good for St. Joseph when I checked the day before, so I changed plans and drove overnight via rental car all the way to Kentucky. All of that succeeded. 10 year promise fulfilled. 

Until the friend door slammed on me. She said I was invited to her wedding, and I was the one guest she wanted to come no matter what. She claimed to have moved the date so friends and family could see the eclipse on the same weekend as the wedding. I told her why I couldn’t come to Boise that weekend even if I wanted to: two months before the eclipse, airline flights, hotels, and rental cars were booked and unavailable in Boise, Salt Lake City, and Denver, not to mention any regional airport in the area. There was no possibility I could get there that weekend. This resulted in a HUGE fight since she thinks I was being selfish for choosing the eclipse over her wedding, saying “there will be more eclipses. I’m only getting married once!” So for months she would say to mutual friends I refused to attend her wedding because she didn’t mean anything to me, because I chose a selfish ambition instead of being there for a friend. Like if I’m not the one getting married, why does my presence mean so much? I sent her my blessings and well wishes, but i said she chose to have the wedding on the same weekend as the biggest celestial event in modern American history. She knew I had planned on seeing the eclipse for 10 years, 8 more years than how many I knew her. But apparently it was selfish of me to choose to see the eclipse from another state.

10275,Not the A-hole,"I was never a “good” kid. I always got into trouble in school and this obviously put a strain on my parents. However, by the time I was about 13 I cleaned up my act. I started to actually excel in school and eventually got pretty involved with JROTC. When I was 15 I decided to take Calculus and Physics at the nearby community college the following fall, because my high school didn’t offer them. At around the same time, my mother, who had just returned from a trip to her home state of Oregon, began to talk about moving away from rural Arkansas where I grew up. 

This is where things started to get pretty complicated. Late spring of that year, my mother called me into her room and asked me if she “could leave.” At first I wasn’t sure what she was asking, but she explained her plan was to go back to Oregon to find work. Then, once she was stable, we could all join her. In the meantime, my stepfather would stay with me. However, my parents quickly found out they could not afford rent on two places at once and convinced my older sister to rent the house and take care of me. My stepfather went to go live with my step-grandparents(sgp) down the road to take care of my sick sgp.

Things went fine until winter when my sister decided to move out to her boyfriend’s. I thought that one of my parents would come back and stay in the house with me, but instead I went to my sgp and, along with my stepfather, they asked me straight up, at 16, “What are you going to do?” I had a job, but it could not cover nearly everything. I ended up staying with friends for long periods of time, eventually working up the nerve to ask “Could I live with you?” Unfortunately, a lot of people are taken aback by questions like that and I always felt awkward asking. However, eventually, I was allowed to stay on a sheep farm for $300 a month. I couldn’t afford it because my job refused to give me more hours, but it was the only option I had. I begged my parents to cover the difference and after a bit of back and forth, they agreed.

Thankfully, from there, my life began to change. In my Junior year of high school, I received a full scholarship to boarding school. At boarding school, I found a love for mathematics and have gone on to study math at one of the top private universities in America. Next year I will graduate, and I don’t want to invite my mother to graduation. I am partly still upset that even though all this shit has happened, we have never talked about it. And partly upset because nothing has changed. Recently she has been contacting me asking about graduation, but I am on the fence.

A few weeks ago I was finally coming to terms that I couldn’t forgive him and it was over and I was getting rid of his stuff.

Well nearly everyone thinks I went too far with tagging them. I guess she didn’t react well because the poems were so personal and I revealed things I guess she didn’t know and she either is planning on or has dumped him.

14856,Not the A-hole,"Hey Reddit! 

My boyfriend and I live in a 1 bedroom/1 bathroom apartment in a major city. For the past week, his brother has been staying with us on vacation - meaning he’s been sitting at home drinking all day/watching tv while we work during the week. I love his brother a ton, don’t get me wrong. He’s really a great kid. We just both work extremely stressful jobs and when I come home, I like having my privacy and being able to relax. Right now, I can barely move around due to a king size air mattress in the living room, clothes and things everywhere, and empty beer cans/food all over the place.

Yesterday, I told my bf that if his brother is just planning on staying a day or two, it is absolutely fine for him to stay with us. I also said that if he is planning on staying for awhile that it may be better for him to stay with us for a bit and then stay with a friend who lives in the same city or perhaps get a hotel room. We literally barely have the space for the two of us to live comfortably in this apartment. 

My bf flipped out, saying that it doesn’t matter how long his brother stays with us, because he’s family, and that I was being an asshole for even bringing this up. So reddit, AITA?

13982,Not the A-hole,"So I'm riding my boosted board (an electric longboard) back from my job this morning. For most of the way I ride in the bike lane, but about
 a quarter mile from my dorm building I have to ride on the sidewalk. This sidewalk is plenty wide enough for me to ride, plus there are no rules against riding on the side walk and it's not very busy around this time; however, there is a choke point where the sidewalk narrows and is only wide enough for like, 3 people side by side. This is where my problem happened.

As I'm approaching the choke point, I see a rather large guy walking in the middle of the sidewalk, not on the right side. Cruising at maybe 8mph, I say ""excuse me"" loud enough for him to hear so that he can get over. I know he heard me because he turned his head to look at me. He keeps walking in the middle. Fine, I'll just squeeze by him.

So I ride between the edge and the guy and just squeeze by him. Not my board, bag, or body touched him and I wasn't going very fast either, maybe the pace of a jog. Although I will say, it was a tight squeeze.

He screams ""HEY WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING!"" I stop ahead of him and turn around and look at him for a second before responding, ""I was watching where I was going, you're the one that didn't move when I asked. I didn't even touch you so just don't even worry about it."" To which he sort of grunted and sneered to. That was the entire conversation.

Right before I hop back on my board a girl that saw it all go down told me I was a jerk for talking like that to a mentally handicapped person. To which I replied, ""I don't care what he is, I don't like assholes."" (I didn't know he had any mental issues until she told me, but I probably wouldn't have handled it differently either way).

9085,Not the A-hole,"
My partner and I have been trying to have a baby for 5 years. We have various fertility issues, and as a result need a sperm donor, lots of medications, and more patience than anyone naturally possesses. Due to the specific nature of our fertility issues we are able to inseminate at home, which is our preference, and we’ve recently decided to move away from frozen sperm from an anonymous donor to using a known donor, a friend of ours who is the same race as my partner. Friend is a bit of a slacker and has been very flaky in the past, so we took time over the past year checking in with him, making sure he definitely wanted to donate (he offered, we didn’t approach him and ask) and was really comfortable with the idea of providing genetic material to create a child he wouldn’t parent. He assured us he was excited to help us. 

Four days ago I told him I will ovulate soon (thanks to copious medications) and would he be able to donate for us on X & X days. He doesn’t answer for hours and when he does, he claims he’s drunk and wants to “think about it when he’s sober”. I immediately felt alarmed but told him no problem. He didn’t get back to me the next day, but yesterday he finally told me that he wasn’t ready to start donating for us because he has too much going on with work, but he’ll let us know when he’s “ready to start this process”. 

I’m... really upset. Of course I would NEVER pressure anyone into this, but I have also spent countless afternoons sobbing to this same friend about my struggle with infertility, how horrifically this struggle (and 3 pregnancy losses in 5 years) has effected my mental health, and telling him how much anger and resentment I hold towards my body for not working correctly. Nothing unprompted, if it matters - he pushed me to trust him and open up. I rarely ovulate on my own, something that went undiagnosed for years, so any time I do manage to ovulate with the help of medication is a BIG deal. I’m not very open about my struggles with anyone BUT him (again after he pushed me to share more so he could be “closer with us and this process” so it’s not like this friend isn’t aware of how long we’ve been trying or how hard it’s been on us. 

At this point, I don’t know that I can be around this friend. Im obviously pretty emotional but I really just feel like this is not the kind of thing I’m going to get over. I don’t hold any ill will against him, but I also don’t want to see him. Even thinking about this is painful. WIBTA if I just quietly stopped hanging out him one on one or going to group events he’ll be present at?


**EDIT**: I thank you all for this discussion. Some really good points were raised to me, and while a lot of people seemed to completely miss the point I was trying to make, I understand this is an emotionally charged topic. I’ve decided to take a while to cool down and let my hormones regulate, and at that point I’m going to have a frank sit down discussion with our friend about why this was so hurtful and how I’d like to move forward - which will be going back to an anonymous donor. Using a known donor was a nice theory, but it leaves us open to too much risk, even though we love this friend dearly and would have enjoyed having this connection to him and his family. I will ask that y’all please stop PMing me that I’m a horrible person.

2425,Not the A-hole,"Weird title but bear with me. As part of my Christmas present last year, my best friend got me a gift certificate to a great spa, and I’ve finally gotten around to using it.

Everything was going pretty normally until the masseuse started massaging my shoulders. I have a weird bump in my collarbone from breaking it about 15 years ago. It’s a little bit visible but feels a lot worse than it looks.

The masseuse felt it and asked me if I have a problem with my lymph nodes. For the record, my grandmother died of lymphoma and it’s a sore subject with me. I also have hypothyroidism so all my glands get checked out pretty regularly. 

I politely said nope, sounds like you found where broke my collarbone! She would not let it go. She started really going after that spot and telling me it felt like a bad lymph node. I repeated myself and asked if she could focus on my back but she kept on going. I started to get a little upset - and honestly it hurt - so I asked her again to stop. She just replied “it feels bad, you should get it checked out,” so I told her we were done and got off the table.

I went to the front desk and told them what happened, and they were shocked...that I didn’t stay on the table. One or the girls even told me massage is good for lymphatic drainage.

1158,Asshole,"A friend of mine came into town and has been staying at my place for a few days before heading to his next location.

I am in the process of buying a washer and dryer so when he got here in last night, he asked for a towel to shower with and I let him know I had to go to the laundromat in the am and would he be alright to use the towel he had used last night.

He said okay.

Fast forward to him getting out of the shower and he comes out telling me that he made an executive decision to not use his towel and instead use the towels in the bathroom and how they felt much nicer than the other towel anyway.

I was legit confused because there were no other towels in the bathroom.

It took a few seconds for me to realize that he must have meant the decorative towels.

I have a really pretty expensive grey towel, folded neatly with a smaller white towel that has elaborate designs to match the bathroom hanging underneath a picture.

I have had these decorative towels for about a year now, undisturbed. Guests come and go, never had an issue messing with these towels, but anyway.

I was a bit annoyed so I let him know that those towels were decorative towels and they weren't meant to be used, that's why they had stayed so nice.

He proceeds to tell me that towels are towels where he's from and where he's from people use the towels in the house because that's what towels are for.

I told him that I get that, but when he asked me for a towel, if I wanted him to use that towel I would have gave it to him.

He then says 'Well that's the point of an executive decision.""

He then starts talking to my cat about how much better the towel felt and how decorative towels are an oxymoron.

I tell him that's not really the point but I can feel my irritation rising as I see the towels crumpled on the floor so I tell him that I am just going to stop and finish journaling. ( I am working on being more present and less reactive and journaling helps.)

As a result, he immediately gets angry and tells me that he will just leave then.

I say okay and that makes him angrier, he says, ""I can't believe you are just going to let me leave over towels, I said I was sorry.""

Except he didn’t say he was sorry and honestly, I wouldn't have even wanted an apology.

I was annoyed at his dismissive and incredulous tone about me having decorative towels and choosing not to use them.

By this time, I am honestly just shocked that HE is mad.

It wasn't a big deal until I said, ""Okay, you know what, I am telling you that I am just going to finish journaling instead of getting into a shouting match over towels.""

He screams out, ""Well, I am not as good a communicator as you.""

I don't know what to say so I say okay,

I told him that I wasn't going to beg him to stay, if he wanted to leave then, by all means, have at it and I go back to journaling.

He grabs his stuff and leaves in a huff. We haven't talked since.

7654,Not the A-hole,"A very popular hiking trail actually crosses my (privately owned) land that is nestled inside a national park. I’ve never objected to people crossing our land as I’m an avid hiker and don’t want to deny them enjoying the scenery, though it can get annoying at times when groups of 10+ people litter on my part of the trail.

Anyway, a few years ago my daughter decided to set up a small stop to sell cold drinks and snacks on the trail. It’s basically a caravan she lives in, but with an attached section to serve drinks and food. So she’ll spend her time in there and every now and then people will pass by and happily top up (it’s a multi day hike). 

It made a surprisingly large amount of money, and so we began taking turns spending time in the caravan on the off chance someone (or a hiking group) passes by.

Now, we live in a place that gets very humid in summer. It “feels like” 40-45 degrees Celsius during June-July. Today i was watching a movie in said caravan when a group of 5 girls rung the bell. They said they were out of water and asked if I could refill their water bottles. I told them I could for 50cents a bottle. The reason we charge money is that all of our water is rainwater and hence limited (especially in summer). We aren’t connected to an endless supply of water.

They were furious that I refused to top them up for free and said they are dehydrating and could faint from heat stroke. I told them where a clean creek was about 1hr down the trail that they could top up (I’ve drunk from there countless times, seriously no risk) but they refused and insisted I top them up. 

They had a young girl with them (around 13) while the rest were in their early 20s. So I refilled the young girl’s bottle and gave her a sprite for free, but insisted the adult women with her pay. They refused and very angrily went on their way.

She was an awesome supervisor and we had a great relationship. We became close friends and I even inspired her to apply for her masters in the same program. Last thing to note: at the end of my internship she met someone online and started a LDR. They were both late-in-life lesbians with kids so they had a lot in common and I was happy for Gale. 

Cut to Nov '19. We were partners for the term cause we thought we worked well together. That turned into a nightmare on its own. She often disrespected me in front of professors and classmates, never stopped talking about her gf to the point I don't think she listened to anything I said even when I needed her support, and became so dependent on me to everything for her. To be fair she did do her part of the assignments but the other behaviours were really starting to strain our friendship. 

During this time my mom was diagnosed with cancer. Living at home and being a very close family this hit me really hard. I turned to Gale for support and kept her updated cause she was a friend and I wanted to give her a heads up in case I was slacking on group things.

Our final project was a presentation and we were selected to present during the 2nd week of presentations. This worked out cause I had a few big projects due during the 1st week and my mom was having surgery the day of those presentations. A few days before the 1st week presentations, Gale comes up to me and asks if we can switch to the 1st week. Apparently her gf (of now 3 months) was visiting and Gale wanted to drive her to the airport on her last day (our presentation date). Initially I said no cause it was going to be too much for me to handle. She called me a dick and stormed out. I felt really bad after cause this was her first lesbian relationship and they seemed to really love each other so I caved in and switched. 

Cue day of presentation. I'm stressed as hell, checking my messages and the clock frequently cause my mom was going into surgery during class. Gale then makes fun of me for being nervous for the presentation. After we present, she says: ""See aren't you happy we presented early? Now we don't have to worry about it"". I lose my temper at her and spit that I would prefer to not present while my mom was in her cancer surgery. Gale then said ""Oh I didn't know your mom was having surgery?"" I was so pissed. I had told her like 5 times. It seemed like she hadn't been listening or cared about a thing I said. I left and made the decision that I needed a mental/emotional break from her so I ghosted her.

I had to stop because we moved.

Last week I told him I want to go to the shelter to pick out a dog to adopt. He told me he should get some say in it. It turns out he doesn't mean helping pick out *which* dog (which I would encourage!) -- it means whether or not I get a dog at all. He doesn't want us to have a dog because even if I do all the work, the dog will be hanging around in the common areas of our house, affecting him. He's afraid it will affect our social life because I might come home early to take care of it.  He's worried he might have to do some dog care if I get sick, or if he's alone in the house with it. Finally, he said ""You can have a dog when we have kids"".  He wants kids, but I don't. He says that's because our social life will change anyway when we have kids, but I feel it's manipulative.

Having a dog seems like a pretty reasonable life decision to me. I also make plenty of money and can afford doggy daycare, plus dog walkers anytime I want.

I feel this is ultimately my decision. He's not allergic, just, in my opinion, being selfish.  

AITA for getting a dog even if he doesn't want one?

ETA: ok, early verdict sounds really clear. I will look into volunteering with dogs or something. Other questions:

- Yes we talked about both kids and dogs before marriage: we both thought we didn't want them 10 yrs ago but would be okay with them ""later"". It turns out one of us is now okay with kids and one of us is now okay with dogs

- Yes we are in couples counseling. Thankfully we didn't discuss the dog thing in counseling yet. I appreciate the insight",68,73,0.79,AITA for getting a dog even if my husband says no?,d97lmi,2019-09-25 18:43:55,YTA,1894,AITA
467,Not the A-hole,"My ex-husband has a son, ""D,"" that's 29. Ex and I were married when D was 8. D was always extremely defiant and hard to deal with, and when he was around 11, I said he was no longer welcome in our home because he was increasingly aggressive and I was concerned for my older daughter's safety.  Over the years I've heard of D acquiring multiple diagnoses of mental illness. He definitely has ADHD, and was diagnosed schizophrenic, but that diagnosis was apparently abandoned in favor of Bipolar. He's had substance abuse issues in the past as well. 

Ex and I are now long-divorced. Our youngest daughter is 16 and alternates weeks between our two households. Ex and his wife are home with my daughter 24/7 currently. D is about to be released from a residential psych program that was court ordered after he was convicted of burglarizing and vandalizing two businesses in 2015, and will be moving into Ex's house later this month until some other program/placement is available for him. (Who knows how long that will be?)

I'm concerned for my daughter's safety and mental health now. I'd hope that D wouldn't do anything to jeopardize his place in his father's home or harm his sister, but he has never been stable and I have no reason to trust him. I'm also concerned about the fact that Ex lied to me and downplayed the facts surrounding D's arrest. I had to get the true details online, and they were much more serious than Ex's version of events. Point blank, D is a mentally ill felon who has never been stable, ever. I don't want my daughter around that. I feel for D and I wish him well in his recovery, but I am 100% not okay with her being in a house with him 24/7. I know that Ex and his wife will be with her, but she already hates it at their house and is stressed enough by having to deal with a stepmom she hates, and I don't want to put her at any further risk. She has stated previously that if she had to live exclusively at one house, she would choose mine.

My wife and I have no problem whatsoever with this and neither does my older son (16M). My brother on the other hand was not happy at this news. Me, him and my sister grew up in a relatively conservative community and he still reflects that. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, he is homophobic. He doesn't like the thought of same sex relationships one single bit. I never tried to confront him about this, even though I disagree with him on it, until I found out about my son. However, it's clear I am not going to change his mind about it.

While I'm sad that he thinks like that, he is family and I want to keep in contact with him. My son however said a few months ago that he wants me to cut him off and said that he basically feels that by keeping in contact with my brother I am not valuing him as a person. I understand why he doesn't want anything to do with my brother, and have allowed him to stop coming with us when we visit and stay in his room or go out the house while my brother visits us. But I don't want to tear the family apart over this and lose my relationship with my brother, and also my niece and nephew. My son got extremely upset when I told him this and accused me of not caring about him and said that I will never understand what it's like to face homophobia.

I(25f) am rooming with 2 people, Susan(24f) & Rae(21non-binary). RN we are in a 600sqft 1bd. Susan & I both go to uni. Rae works (or used to but covid). Susan also works. I get enough grant $ to cover my tuition + extra. My dad will cover the rest of my costs but I have to maximize my aid.

We found a 2bd place around the same price as a 1bd - it’s only a little more expensive for a lot more space. When we were deciding, Rae says that they need to stick close to what they are paying now. Susan & I agree that we can pay a little more to keep Rae’s costs down. So, we sign the lease (dad co-signed b/c our incomes weren’t enough). Susan volunteers herself to make a space in the living room as her bedroom. She said she won’t pay less rent that it was her choice & she was okay w/ it. I’m not going to argue w/ her but to me she should be paying less. Rae says to me ‘if it’s okay with you I’d like the bigger room’. It didn’t sit right w/ me.

Turns out Rae will be paying about $150 LESS than Susan & I. Since my dad is helping me out it’s not just my financial decision to make. I don’t want to take advantage or abuse the help I am receiving. 

I have trouble sticking up for myself & on more than one occasion Rae has told me that I am ‘passive to an annoying degree’.

I send to our group chat that, my dad & I are okay with paying a bit more in rent to lower Rae’s cost but if they are paying less, they should be in the smaller bdrm. If Rae wanted the bigger room, then things need to be split equally between all three of us. 

Both roommates took that as me backing out of our ‘agreement’. I reiterate that I’m fine paying more to help Rae out, but that if they wanted the larger bd they needed to split rent equally. Susan comes to Rae’s defense saying that Rae earns every cent they make & they don’t have any other support whereas at least we have our parents helping us out. Again, I just say it wouldn’t be fair to any of us if Rae got the biggest room for the least amount of rent.

Rae then brings up that I said, months earlier, that they could have the bigger room. To be fair, I did say that, but that was under the presumption we were all splitting rent equally. The rent reduction wasn’t brought up until a couple weeks ago. Rae think it’s fair for them to get the bigger room because this is the only place they have since I’m only there for school, & can ‘go home’. If we were splitting things equally, I 100%, no hesitation would give them the bigger room. But things aren’t equal. Again, I just want things to be fair.

Eventually, Rae conceded & I’m getting the bigger room (yay me... /s). As a final message Rae sent: “You cannot complain in anything that follows with the bigger room. Its not our job to keep you from self isolating.” Which I feel is just retaliation for things not going their way & a dig at me & my mental health issues.

I feel like I’m getting ganged up on & being made out to be the bad guy in this.

9812,Not the A-hole,"So last year, my mom had a stroke and became mentally disabled and paralyzed. I was taking my finals when it happened, and was put on academic probation shortly afterwards. My brother and I were faced with the dilemma of handling her finances. I worked at a disability law firm for a year, so the answer was obvious: sell EVERYTHING and file for government aid immediately. He responded with ""No no we can handle it"". Since then we agreed that he would pay for the mortgage and insurance. I would pay for the car and pay for all of her house fees and bills and such.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was young, 20 years old and not exactly in the best place to be making financial decisions that large. About half a year passed and I was on the verge of academic suspension, largely due to the stress of juggling working full-time, and going to school full time in two different campuses 53 miles apart. I came to my brother and told him that I couldn't handle all of the bills and he agreed to pay the car note. I got into an accident, and found out he wasn't keeping up with insurance. I was stuck at the house with no way to get to class or work. This along with the threat of foreclosure, I dropped out of school to try and figure out just how the hell I was going to pay for everything on top of my bills.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fast forward to 2 months ago. I'm gearing up to start school again, but of course I can't afford it. In order to register for another chance at academic probation, I have to prove that I've changed my living situation and have moved closer to campus because that was one of the major causes for my grades absolutely tanking. I tell my brother that I have to move from the house in order to get financial aid, because I can't pay for both school and everything regarding the house. He offers me a deal. I stay in the house and pay half of the rent, he comes down and gives me an old beater so I don't have to worry about saving for a car. He never came. We did this dance about 2 more times.

Yesterday, other family members sent me a text asking what they could do to help. He blocked them so I sent him a screenshot of the text and he responded "" Your rent is 10 months behind, your car payment is 10 months behind, and you will have to keep paying for all of the bills etc."". After all of this, and trying to move out multiple times because its too goddamn expensive for me to pay near $400 a month in bills for what is essentially a run down hoarder home with no a/c or hot water, paying for school, and everything, I'm looking at apartments and trying to sign a lease to get the hell out by July 2nd. But by doing this, its dropping all of the expenses on my older brother.

13311,Not the A-hole,"I (25m) have been best friends with James (25m) since 6th grade. He was once in an abusive relationship with a girl we'll call Ella. She accused him of cheating, stole his phone to unfriend girls, isolated him, even got physical, digging her nails into his arms/pushed him as hard as she could. When we got the chance to hang out, the conversation was always about Ella and we never got to have fun. Our friends got bored and drifted away, but I knew that abusers isolated victims, so I stuck with him.

This led to 5 years of frustration. Every conversation was about how much he wanted to break up. I listened, offered advice. It was always ignored. Years in, I got tired. I had my own shit going on, deaths in the family, a sports injury that cost me a scholarship, but James never asked how I was. If he did, he'd barely listen and turn it back to Ella as soon as he could. Our friendship became strained, but eventually he broke up with Ella for real. We've been fine ever since; I chalked his selfishness at that point up to the abuse.

Nine months ago, he started dating a girl he met at work. Beth is sweet, and very kind. She also happens to be incredibly boring. James is outdoorsy and likes adrenaline. He spends his weekends dirt biking or climbing. Beth likes to stay in and watch Netflix. She is also hard to engage in conversation. At first I thought she was just shy, but James has been complaining that she doesn't talk much or have a personality. She also has no sense of humour or at least not one compatible with ours.

I've kept my opinion quiet; she's nice and James has seemed happy, despite the occasional complaint. I've offered solutions; compromises, asking questions to start conversation, etc. But this weekend he asked me for my personal opinion. I told him I think she's boring and they aren't compatible longterm. James instantly agreed. This was a red flag; he used to agree with my opinion when it came to Ella, then later decided I was an asshole for criticising his girlfriend. But I thought we'd outgrown that.

James chose to break up with Beth. With the relationship over, I felt comfortable expressing my opinion. I pointed out the incompatibilities I'd noticed, and suggested she might be low intelligence hence the lack of conversation. I wasn't trying to be mean; I also said that she was a sweet girl and I wished her well.

Today, James told me the break up is off. He wants to propose. I'm irritated; I was short in my reply to his text. He asked what was up. I said I could see this becoming an Ella situation; not that Beth was abusive but I'll have to listen to him complain for the rest of my life. I told him I was tired of wasting my time offering input that goes ignored and I don't want to be made to look like an unsupportive friend for being critical of his partner. He told me I'm an asshole.

I am honestly in tears while writing this because my sister locked herself in the room for 12 hours and did not eat or drink anything and it’s all my fault. My parents will be breaking the door soon because of how worried they are since she’s been silent for 2 hours straight.

My sister lost her arm 3 months ago, ever since that time she hasn’t been the same person. My parents and I tried to be as supportive as possible. She became severely depressed because of this and lost almost 7 kg of weight and has not left the house since. Things were starting to get better this week and I tried to make her go outside for 30 minutes but she had a huge panic attack there and screamed at everyone to stop looking at her (nobody was looking at her, it was really all in her head) so we went back home.

I have a poor relationship with my own mother so I didn't want to invite her and my father died of cancer when I was 6. Now knowing my mother, I know she will raise hell if she is excluded but other relatives aren't. This problem has lead to us not planning our wedding for the past 5 years, however during covid 19 when we were so happy just with each other as company we decided to screw it and just do a friend only wedding. We planned it all in the last month. A 7 course degastation at a vineyard w matching wines, beautiful floral arrangements will be hanging from the ceiling and we will have a string quartet for the ceremony and canapes. Truly it's like a fancy dinner party. Everything was planned and perfect. 

However apparently when we said no family my fiance thought that meant no family except his mum and step dad. When I corrected him he was crushed. I explained my mum will throw a fit to high heavens if his mother is invited but not her. He was like, she lives 8 hours away what can she do? I have been with this man 7 years and it's like he has completely forgotten all the other things she's pulled from 7 hrs away. AITA for standing firm on the no family rule?

Update: should probably have added this at the beginning. His mother is not a nice person, her own mother has dementia and is in a home. As she has power of attorney she sold her mother's apartment and renovated her own home thinking her mother would not live long and she would inherent soon. She lied to us when she sold the apartment and said she just needed the money in more liquid form for nannas care. Turns out nanna is still living and the money ran out for the home so she down graded her to a cheaper room she shares with other dementia patients and her and my partner split the cost of her care but she doesn't always pay her share so we frequently chip in more to cover the difference. She promised to sell the mobile home she bought to upgrade nanna back to a better room but over a year on she hasn't even started advertising it. I think this woman's action is lower than dirt but I never criticise her to my partner, whatever she is it's still his mother. Also this will be my fiances 3rd wedding to my 1st.

In large, thick, shaky black letters. It's about an inch high and 2 wide, and it's on the back of his shoulder. The first time he saw it properly was when I took a picture on my phone to show him.

My boyfriend, having seen the tattoo in all it's glory, was just sort of holding his head in his hands and was clearly upset. I tried to reassure him but he just went to take a shower. Before he went in he admitted he wasn't sure what to do with the tattoo.

I have a cousin who is a tattoo artist, and she has given both myself and my boyfriend tattoos before now. Due to how it was done - with a tattoo gun by a drunk friend - I was concerned about infection. He also wasn't sure what he wanted to do with it - removal, cover up, or leave it as it is.

I'm sitting in the smack middle seat of the plane, 10 seats across. 3, 4, then 3 again. Our flight is delayed and we're sitting on the tarmac, 2 how's and counting. A man and his wife demanded that the person on the plane next to me (sharing the middle) be moved so they can sit together. Totally reasonable. They didn't have to be rude, but whatever, right? So it's a guy, me, the husband and the wife.

Everything fine for about 30 minutes, but then guy starts pulling my purse out from under the seat in front of me, saying he wants to put this feet there. My purse was at my feet under the seat in front of me. It wasn't on ""his"" side. I asked him to leave my purse alone and his wife starts grabbing it and yanking it out. I reached down to grab my purse and this lady starts pinching and slapping my hand. The man starts getting upset, saying I'm being rude, that he's ""politely"" telling me to move my stuff so he can put his feet there. A flight attendant came over and asked us both to calm down. I told her I just want to watch a movie and zone out to my overnight flight. The guy next to me stops.

Then he starts putting his feet on my purse and kicking it. Then he's kicking it harder and trying to dig it out from under the seat with his feet. I ask him to stop and he tells me that I'm very rude and he won't let me do what I want because then I'd win. But he stopped kicking my back, so I ignored him, put my headphones back on, and went back to my movie.

A few minutes later, the wife goes and asks another flight attendant to come make me move my purse. So fine, the person next to me let's me put my purse under his seat and he put his laptop bag in the overhead storage. Problem solved. I put my feet or straight in front of me and am putting my headphones on when he pushed my feet out of the way and starts getting upset again that my feet are STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. He wants HIS feet there with his legs spread. 

The flight attendant comes back and asks ME to keep my feet to the side of the guy with the laptop bag. Sitting at an angle. For a 10 hour flight. He defended this guy's using my space and asks me to stop being a problem. I asked the nice guy with the laptop bag if we could switch seats and the flight attendant said no, we can't do that once we've taxied away from the gate. 

So I have my legs straight out in front of me, he's angry, and the flight attendant thinks I'm being an asshole. AITA for fighting back or should I have just crossed my legs off to one side and sucked it up for 10+ hours? Now this guy keeps muttering at me in another language. He and his wife are shooting eye daggers at me and I'm just sitting in the tarmac in the middle seat.

she really likes proportioned foods. things that are already packaged in small portions to prevent her from over-snacking. that’s normal, but she gets these small apple sauce pouches and these fruit purée pouches, small low calorie snacks that are literally made by Gerber and they’re intended for literal babies. 

she likes them bc to her, they taste good, they’re low calorie, and again, they’re already portioned into small servings. but it’s literally childish. it’s for BABIES. there’s plenty of “adult” foods that are small portioned and low calorie. every time we have family or friends over they always comment on that food being in the fridge and some even question if we have a kid or not. it’s just annoying and unnecessary. 

so i asked her to stop buying these snacks and get something more “grown up” and she simply said “no”. she even tried to show me on her phone that what she’s doing is common and that so many other adults eat these snacks but i wasn’t buying it so it broke into a whole fight, where i was calling her immature and saying she had to grow up (i know, that was rude) and she was saying that im being a dickhead for getting mad at her for something that she says is harmless.

She got in touch with my best friend here, asked him to write a letter and get flowers sent to my place. The letter said really creepy things like “I see you everyday and I’m interested in you. Bring a condom the next time you see me. I know where you are everyday.”

I obviously freaked out, thinking I was somebody stalking me. I went to another friend and she suggested I approach the cops, and I thought I’d give it a day.

I entertained it because I wanted to build a conversation for if we ever met in person or if I went to the police. 

This went on for a week, and yesterday my partner said it was her the whole time. I obviously lost it, saying it wasn’t funny. The flowers and the letter would’ve been funny, but making a fake account and engaging for a week was psychotic. I said I wasn’t amused, and that it better not happen again.

16486,Not the A-hole,"Ugh, throw away because I honestly feel ridiculous just for having to ask this, and pretty much everyone I know knows my real username.

Backstory:

Bf's bestie's (I'll call him Bjorn) birthday was last weekend, and we were supposed to go visit (we live about 3.5 hours away). I asked Bf if Bjorn wanted to do an activity I had access to discounted tickets to, and Bjorn was stoked. I bought 4 tickets, one for each of Bjorn, his gf, my bf, and me. 

Last minute-ish, Bjorn and gf let us know that they were sick and asked us to come another weekend. No big deal, people get sick all the time, so we told them so, tentatively planning for the following (this) weekend.

About halfway through the week, bf told me that Bjorn's gf is working and that if I go I may ""feel like the third wheel while the dudes are bro-ing out"". I mean, I get it, its Bjorn's birthday, you don't get to see him much. So I told him (honestly) that I had no problem staying home so he could go hang out with Bjorn and not have to worry about me. We briefly discussed the tickets, and discussed saving them for another trip so the four of us could go together.
 
Edited for clarity: we discussed him going on the 3.5 hour trip without me, which I was absolutely fine with. Afterward we discussed saving the tickets for another visit and they would ""bro-out"" instead.

Today, bf asked me where the tickets were, so he could bring them to use this weekend. I was kind of taken aback and reiterated what I thought our previous agreement was (all using them another time) and he kind of flippantly said we hadn't AGREED to that, and if he can't take the discounted (well... for him, free because I paid for them) tickets, he will pay full price. I told him it wasn't a huge deal and where to find them. 

Later I noticed he took all four tickets and mentioned it. He replied that ""well yeah, in case Bjorn's gf is coming"".

He very distinctly told me there was no way Bjorns gf was going to be around, which was why I had decided not to go. At that point, i excused myself to think because I was frustrated, and wanted to collect my thoughts on whether or not it was justified.

So, AITA for being frustrated that my bf is using these tickets without me? On one hand, they were meant as a gift for Bjorns birthday, but on the other, they were explicitly meant for the four of us to spend together. I'm just feeling kind of... used.

Edit 2: talked to bf. He said when he told me about ""third-wheeling"" he wasn't disinviting me, just ""managing expectations"". Regardless I can't go because we cancelled the dog-sitter, who now has other plans.
I told him he can take two tickets. One for Bjorn, and one for himself. If Bjorns gf ends up going (still not guaranteed, and it sounds like a possibility bf just made up himself?) they can purchase a full-price ticket for her.

There was a new girl hired in our department who went through the training and  joined the sales floor, and then started calling in sick and missing shifts regularly. 
 Our manager kept us informed of her reasons, which all seemed to be valid. She was pregnant, but having complications,  then in the hospital, then home recovering, then sick with something else. I went out one Friday night for a friend's birthday and ran into her at a bar. We chatted a bit ""Oh, how are you doing? We miss you at the store...etc."" She tells me she's feeling better and will be back tomorrow. 
 Next day Saturday rolls around and we are doing our weekly all store meeting. Manager says ""Oh, sorry guys you're down 1 again today, she called in sick again.""

I am honestly in tears while writing this because my sister locked herself in the room for 12 hours and did not eat or drink anything and it’s all my fault. My parents will be breaking the door soon because of how worried they are since she’s been silent for 2 hours straight.

My sister lost her arm 3 months ago, ever since that time she hasn’t been the same person. My parents and I tried to be as supportive as possible. She became severely depressed because of this and lost almost 7 kg of weight and has not left the house since. Things were starting to get better this week and I tried to make her go outside for 30 minutes but she had a huge panic attack there and screamed at everyone to stop looking at her (nobody was looking at her, it was really all in her head) so we went back home. It was really hard for her and her boyfriend to hang out since she’s been staying inside, he actually saw her only 2 times this whole 3 months and were just texting the rest of the times. Today, he did the most horrible thing imaginable. He broke up with her through text. As much as I hate what he did, I understand why he wouldn't be comfortable breaking up with her in the house.

He really is not a bad person as I know him too and we are good friends.

Basically, part of the core curriculum at my university involved taking one science class, so a lot of people who weren't particularly fond of science related material all were in the same class together.

The first exam of the semester was particularly difficult, for me despite the fact that I studied a week leading up to the test, during the exam I knew I wasn't going to do well, and that was the general feeling throughout the room. 

Halfway through the test I noticed a girl was on her phone and looking at the slides the professor gave us to study and copying down charts, and graphs. 

I told the professor what I saw when I turned my test in, and she was livid to say the least. 

I never saw that girl in class again, I wasn't sure if she was asked not to come back or dropped the class after the professor talked to her. I had to do a statement for the school's honor council, and it was my word against hers so she wasn't kicked out of school for it. 

But I heard through her friends that were still in the class that whoever turned her in was a b\*\*\*, that they should have honored the 'unspoken code between students' not to narc... etc. 

My own friends also thought I shouldn't have said anything because she had to drop the class and I may have messed up her schedule to graduate on time, basically saying that I messed with her life because she had to go through the honor council and could have gotten kicked out of our university. 

But I think she did it to herself by cheating, if she had just failed with the rest of the class she would have been fine! The professor told us after we got the results that she was going to drop the lowest scoring test from our final grade, and made the first test particularly hard to scare us (only two people got As, a handful got Bs, and the rest got Cs and Ds).

I can honestly say he was the love of my life and it devastated me losing him. He was the kindest, loving, most compassionate man I've ever met.

My inlaws though are a different story. My late husband came from money whereas I didn't, they were harshly judgmental from day one because I come from a very poor background and was working a minimum wage job while supporting my siblings and parents. In their minds, I was some gold-digging whore. They had even gone as far as to suggest that our children aren't his. I did everything to assuage their fears to no avail even insisting we signed a prenup before we got married. To put it frankly these people if they even acknowledge my existence are cold and extremely passive-aggressive. 

When my husband passed they tried to blame me for the accident (I wasn't even there), they tried to contest his will that named myself and his children as beneficiaries, they even tried to usurp his funeral and steamroll me into accepting what they wanted.

She was asking me if she could push it around (no) she was getting super close to my newborn (stop) and was generally just being annoying.

I'm not in a frat and my girlfriend isn't in a sorority but she has friends in sororities and occasionally gets invited to frat parties with them,

I have always held that she's free to go to such parties with her friends, but I'm clearly very uncomfortable with it so she has respected my wishes (despite me telling her to go) and not gone to any since we've been together.

Recently though this is putting some strain on out relationship because she very much wants to go to these parties but I can't look her in the eye and say I'm okay with her going. This in turn has made me feel very much like an asshole because I'm in effect keeping her from having fun with her friends.

The thing I can't get over though is what she's gonna enjoy at these parties because although she'll go with her friends, I very much know that once you get there it's literally just dancing - grinding on random dudes - and occasionally hooking up with frat guys. Now I'm secure enough in our relationship that I don't think there's the slightest chance she'd hook up with a frat guy (at least not by choice), but it's basically inevitable that she'll be dancing on some guys as that's literally all there is to do there and it very much makes me uncomfortable. 

Also, she doesn't drink either so it's not just the fun of going out getting drunk with friends, maybe I'm missing something but I really don't see what she could possibly enjoy out of it other than dancing on other guys which doesn't make sense to me since she seems to be very much in love with me and we're very much exclusive.

TLDR: My girlfriend wants to go to frat parties with her friends. This makes me uncomfortable as I don't see what the parties have to offer other than grinding on dudes. I tell her she can go but that it would make me a little uncomfortable. She doesn't go and makes me feel like an asshole for ""not letting her go"".

Me and my grandma have a lot in common but the one thing we both have in common is the preservation of our history

My grandma use to be an archeologist and a famouse author and throughout the years has amounted a museum load of artifacts. She also has personal arrifacts of our own family dating back to christopher colombus. 

Issues started to arrise when my grandfather died. And in his will he left the family bible to me. Now this bible is over 500 years old. Our ancestor sailed with Christopher Columbus on his first voyage and only brought that bible with him. 

I myself have a personal museum with artifacts of my own and its safely begind a glass pain. My grandmother has then stated to me that when she dies she wants me to take all of her artifacts and all of our families history and keep it safe. To pass on. 

The rest of the family are pissed as hell claiming their children have a right to those things. That those are ecuadorian history hence it should not leave ecuadorian land.  And that it belongs to them. 

The problem is im the only one who has taken the time to look up our history. To preserve our heretage and have spent thousands to keep them safe.

3434,Not the A-hole,"So some context is needed before I start. 

Sandra only has one daughter Bess who lives with our Nan in another city. Bess has been dating Nathan for around two years now and in that time my sister and my brother can both count on one hand the times that they've met him.

Last year my sister got married in a small wedding. Both her and my BIL have larger families so the guests were only family with a few close friends /family friends also invited. Because of this both my sister and BIL decided that no one would have plus ones.

Six months before the wedding the invites were sent out and Sandra was not happy. My sister had sent an invite to Sandra, her husband John, and Bess but didn't invite Nathan as my sister had barely met him and there is a no plus one rule. Sandra flipped and began ringing around other relatives to see if anyone had been given a plus one. She wasn't happy that our uncles girlfriend, who we have met many times and has put in a great effort to get to know us since being with our uncle. 

Sandra decided not to speak to my sister and instead went over her head to our dad and called him while he was at work. She accused my sister of bullying Bess by not inviting Nathan and was trying to force my dad to get an invite for him from my sister. When Sandra was told nobody had plus ones she again kicked off about other 'plus ones' to which my sister told her that they had known them a lot longer and had met up with them on numerous occasions. Sandra didn't talk to my sister after that, failed to rsvp and booked a holiday for the same day, before threatening to not allow my Nan to attend the wedding. Our other Aunt was able to convince her to let her bring up our Nan and she really enjoyed the day. 

Fast forward to January this year when my brother send out his own invites. As a result of his new baby the wedding budget is very modest and so the day will be extremely intimate so no plus ones.

My brother invited Sandra, John and Bess but no Nathan. Sandra again kicked off. She once again rang my dad at work and accused him of allowing his children to tear the family apart. Sandra threatened my dad that if Nathan wasn't invited he would never hear or see either Sandra or his mother again. She keeps accusing my siblings of bullying Bess and lying about how many times they've met Nathan.

The rsvp date passed and no reply so they don't have a space at the wedding now and Sandra kicked off again and is again threatening to stop our Nan from being able to attend the wedding.  

The wedding is now two weeks away and Sandra is starting to kick up a fuss again and my brother is too stressed to deal with it.

My friend is VERY very good-looking. He met his wife before he met me around 7? years ago through school or something, and she's .. a mess. I mean she's not the ugliest, but she's really tiny and kinda pudgy she has an acne problem which I don't understand since she's 27. She also has a double-chin when she speaks which isn't the WORST i guess, but compared to my friend who is SO good-looking she's.. basically like a 2. The only thing I can give her is that she's kinda funny and she is book smart/ok job i guess. But that's IT. I have tried my hardest to hint to my friend that he's young, he's only 25, he can find someone else, even I'm open to dating him (he's GORGEOUS) but hes never caught any hints. It's like he's under a spell.

His wife is pregnant atm which is frustrating cos I havent seen him in a while (virus) and we used to call at least semi-regularly but now he can't because she makes him wait on her hand and foot and he's lovesick for some reason. FINALLY got to video-call him the other day after weeks and he looked tired but happy and gorgeous as ever. She came to say hi and she's REALLY let herself go. I couldn't even look at her straight without grimacing, she was a mess. When she left the room all he talked about was her and baby this and baby that, and she this and she that and ""she's glowing"" and shit. It's like we see two different people!

Finally I couldn't take it anymore and asked what exactly he sees in her. He was like what do you mean, so I gave him some examples (that i put above). Instead of talking to me like an adult, he went really silent and when I was like what is it and he said ""do you mean that?"" and I said ""yes..?"" and he said ""I'm way too tired for this"" ??? and then he suddenly hung up on me and before I even had space to breathe, BLOCKED ME EVERYWHERE. ?????

I really DO NOT understand what I said wrong. I really do want to know what he sees in her, they don't even have the same interests!

3817,Not the A-hole,"Just to be clear, I wasn't a major drug addict. When I was 15-16, I started using drugs, like x and sometimes pills and weed and such. By 17 I was doing cocaine and amphetamines and a plethora of other drugs consistently. I also slept with an absurd amount of guys. There was a point when I was 17-18 when I slept with... a lot of guys. Like sometimes multiple guys a week, often much older men. I was living on my own mostly and was just completely messed up from family issues. I went to rehab soon after my 19th birthday, mostly for cocaine, but I wasn't a full on hardcore drug addict in that sense, I was just a mess overall and the drugs contributed to that. I quit all drugs and mostly alcohol after, and I went to therapy, a lot of it. I would still consider myself a drug addict back then though, in the sense that I did a large amount and craved them a lot. Just not like, super drug addict. I hope that makes sense lol. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, fast forward to today, and I've been dating this guy Marcus for the past 4 months. I've been writing short stories about various points in my life, and one of them is me when I was in rehab, and he read it and right away was freaked out that I never told him I was in rehab, or that I was ever a drug addict. I had told him before that I had a very fucked up childhood, and he was fine with that, I just didn't think he would be so hyperfocused on the rehab/drug addict thing. He was pretty upset about it, he felt it was something I should have told him sooner, but I just... never felt it was THAT big of a deal. Frankly I likely could have quit the drugs without the rehab, I was on the road to getting better either way, I just felt it was a good idea to get some help for the drugs and other problems there. I never thought it was that big of a deal. 

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole for not telling him this? He doesn't think of me as an 'asshole' but he is definitely upset that I never told him I used to be a drug addict. I mean, I've told him before that I had a messed up childhood and that I used a lot of drugs and all kinds of stuff, but suddenly me going to rehab means I'm damaged goods? Not anything else that I mentioned? Not like I am damaged goods or anything, but he seems to think its like a 'step above' everything else to have a history of addiction. Which isn't entirely false, but again, I wasn't exactly a hardcore addict in that sense.

When I tried to smile at her or nod, I could never get any eye contact. I didn’t think much of it, until my co worker told me she was transgender. I thought it was a bit weird that she randomly just said that to me, but I thought it explained maybe why she was shy or quite. So next time I saw her, I wanted to try and talk to her, so I told her that I liked her pink hair (which a do). She was SO happy and her face lite up so much and she just started talking to me non stop about her hair. I was happy that I was able to “break the ice”. 
Last week my husband came and got me at work, and in the parking lot I was talking to her with my husband. When she left, my husband looked at me and asked: what the heck was that? 
I was confused and asked him what I did....? And he told me that he NEVER saw me talk like that to another girl. The “omg I looovvveeeeeeee your outfit ! Where in the world did you get it ?! You look so cute and adorable!!!” 
I felt really bad when he told me that, cause in that moment I realized that never do I talk to other people like that.

10436,No A-holes here,"My domestic partner requested that I make this post to gauge the opinion of uninvolved third parties. In the past few years, as my grandparents get on in age, they’ve been telling me, and now us, about how I stand to inherit their home once they decide to move into a retirement community or in the event of one of their deaths. Since we were all over for Father’s Day the subject came up once again. 

She and I are in agreement over one part, my mother expects that even once the home is in my name that it will continue to be the sole location for any and all family events; my partner and I have already agreed that we will set hard limits on which events we host and that it will not be the same type of open door policy to extended family. However, we came to a disagreement when discussing how we’d decorate one of the rooms. 

What my grandparents currently use as the living room is divided by a brick wall, and above the couch are nicely framed portraits and collages of our family, aunts, uncles, adopted siblings, myself and biological siblings, my grandparents family from where they emigrated, etc. As we’re discussing turning that living room into a recreation room she says, “We’re getting rid of all the pictures on the wall, right?” To which I replied, “Excuse me, you want me to put away all the pictures of my family?” Fortunately we have a very good rapport, that’s why I wanna marry her, but we were not seeing eye to eye on this issue. 

She is of the opinion that since she hasn’t met most of the people pictured that there’s no reason to have them up. I explained that my intention would be to rearrange the wall of portraits, adding photos of her family, our adventures as a couple and eventual family together. She persisted that she thought we should remove all the photos my grandparents have in the house and then populate it solely with photos of our own. I said that I would never dream of doing the same to the home her parents intend on willing to her so how could she expect me to do the same?

He was awake and about for an hour or two, where he could have messaged saying oh let's reschedule for x time, but instead he just leaves it and me getting upset cause he just won't say. I think this is really rude! Eventually he says in another hour from now.

We did our makeup and put on some bunny ears for the occasion. Our mom had already started cooking Easter dinner (which she does almost every year) and saw my sister and I dressed up, so she decided to dress up nicely as well. My dad saw this and copied her. All the while, my 37 year old sister who lives with us never left her room. We could all hear her arguing on the phone loudly with her boyfriend for several hours. 

My sister and I got comfortable on the couch to play our Switches and my dad decided to take some photos of us. Keep in mind, while I was dressed up I was also wrapped up in a blanket and holding a game in my hand. 

My mom came downstairs dressed nicely and my dad said “Can you sit down for a second so I can take a picture?” At that point I sat up straight, removed the blanket, etc. Then my mom got out of the picture and took one of me, my twin, and my dad. Then my twin said “Okay, now how do we get all four of us together?” 

I set up the timer on my phone camera and started propping up the phone against a piece of furniture. That’s when my older sister came downstairs, wearing sweats and the same shirt she’s had on for at least 3 days.

Older Sister: So you guys are taking a picture and no one could tell me?

My mom: We didn’t know you were awake, go put something on and get in! 

Older Sister: You want me to get in NOW? You’re taking a FAMILY PHOTO without the whole family. Do you not see how that makes me feel?

Me: It wasn’t a big deal, we were just taking photos and everyone kept getting in.

Older Sister: Don’t tell me what’s not a big deal! What’s a big deal to me might not be a big deal to you!

I told her not to scream at me and she continued screaming at all of us. It became a pretty big argument and at some point I just gave up and got back on my game. This isn’t the first time she’a gotten upset like this over something that wasn’t a big deal at all.

7901,Not the A-hole,"My future brother-in-law and his wife just had their first child. My BIL is the first of his generation in his family to have a baby, so everyone is so excited about the baby’s arrival. I love the baby so much and I love kids in general. 

However, my wedding is going to be an adults-only event. My mom feels very strongly that weddings are not a place for kids, and, to be honest, I kind of agree. At least, young children who might cry or just make noise in general have been distracting at weddings I’ve been to in the past. I’m sorry to anybody who disagrees; it’s not personal. 

Anyway, my BIL and his wife are adamantly insisting that they are going to bring the baby to the wedding, even after my fiancé mentioned a few times that we were not going to have kids at the wedding. Not only is my BIL insisting on bringing him, but he says it very aggressively, like “f*** that, I’m bringing my m******f***ing kid wherever I want.”  I am trying to be understanding of the fact that they are new parents and probably both excited to introduce family the baby and worried about leaving the baby with anyone else. But they are both in the bridal party, with him being the best man and her a bridesmaid, so they won’t really be able to hold the baby that much. Also I am worried that the responsibility of watching the baby will fall on my fiancé’s mom, dad, sister, or other close relatives and prevent them from being engaged in the day. I really think that would be hurtful to my fiancé in some way. My fiancé and his brother do not have the best relationship as it is and I do not want there to be any added tension between them at the wedding. 

Not to mention, my mom, who can be a very intimidating person, is absolutely 100% not willing to make an exception and allow the baby at the wedding. She said that if my BIL tried to bring the baby she would send him home... and I believe her. 

I don’t think I’m a selfish person and I hate the idea of coming across as one. But in the end, I really don’t like how my BIL is refusing to agree to our request and I don’t know if I can give in.

2583,Not the A-hole," I (23F) don’t like children. About 80% of the reason is that I just don’t have maternal feelings and 20% of it is that I biologically can’t ever have kids myself so I don’t particularly want to surround myself with something I can’t have. During my engagement to my husband, I found out that his brother and sister-in-law were expecting their first baby. 

On the day of their babyshower I ended up having a total panic attack and was completely skeeved out, so I was unable to attend. In the interest of full disclosure, I sent them a babyshower card in which I expressed my happiness and support for their growing family and told them the fact that I can’t have kids and am not really a kid person. The idea was that I could tell them about this so that they know that I mean them no ill-will with my absence.

My husband and I are now married and the brother and sister-in-law have their toddler. Every few weeks for the past year, my brother-in-law will text my husband to ask whether I will come by and babysit for them. So far I have turned them down each time and my husband has done it instead. What I’m particularly frustrated about is that if my brother and sister-in-law need a babysitter, they text my husband to ask specifically whether I’d do it. However, if they are hosting a “fun event” at their house, such as a game or movie night with their other twentysomething friends, only my husband gets invited. I think my husband’s brother and sister-in-law are really nice people who I’d love to get to know better. I brought up the fact that I seem to only be invited to babysitting and not fun events with my husband, who then addressed it with his brother. Since then, the only thing that has changed is that now *both* my husband and I get invited to babysit, yet he is still the only one who is invited to fun nights. The only non-babysitting thing that I have been invited to was my niece’s upcoming birthday party. 

I find it absolutely bewildering that they have repeatedly asked me to babysit because they barely know me, know that I have no experience with kids, and are aware that I don’t particularly like being around kids. Am I the asshole for being peeved when being asked to babysit my niece?

TL;DR I don’t like kids, but my husband’s brother keeps asking him whether I can babysit their kid.

EDIT: 
- These aren't ""boys nights"" or ""brothers only nights"". I totally respect that and totally wouldn't want to intrude.
- I didn't make this clear in the original post, but I've had in-person heart-to-heart talks with my brother-in-law and sister-in-law about my awkwardness with kids before (totally independent of the baby shower). The sister-in-law said she could relate to feeling like I did when she was my she too. I have told them that I'm not really into babysitting, but would do it if my husband isn't available.
- Also for context: My husband totally doesn't mind babysitting (he enjoys it in fact). Also, I definitely wouldn't mind babysitting in an emergency or something.",66,89,0.88,AITA for being peeved at being asked to babysit my niece?,dfrgmo,2019-10-10 02:21:59,NTA,3014,AITA

16207,Asshole,"I feel bad for having to post this up here, but PLEASE PLEASE read my edits. Thank you. 

This is something I've been really debating in my head for the past few days. I really would like to know if I'd be in the wrong if I do this. (Tell me if this would fit better in r/Advice and I'll move it) 

There has been this rumor I've been told by two trusted friends and confirmed by another that a girl at my school was kicked out of our school musical because she was caught drinking alchohol on school property. (She is underage aswell). But I have no hard proof that this is true. 

This girl is also in my community theater show, and I was debating on sending my director an anonymous note to check in with my school's drama director to see if this is true. Because if it is, I dont feel comfortable with her being in this show. Will I be the asshole? 

Edit: The way my community theater works is you must sign many contacts proving your commitment to a show. One of the contracts is specifically that you would not commit any crimes while apart of the show. (Stuff including: drinking or smoking any kind of product). So, she also broke this contract. 

Edit 2: After you all said to, I asked her if these rumors where true or not. She said she got kicked out because she came to practice hungover. So yes, they were (pretty much). 

Edit 3: Alot of people are apparently commenting from other counties asking how old is underage? We live in America, the drinking age is 21, she is 16.

Edit 4: (FINAL EDIT UNLESS THIS SITUATION IS WORSENED OR SOLVED) Thank you all for such quick responses. I truly do appreciate any and all advice/opinions (even if some were... harsh). I have decided to ""mind my own business"" as many (many) of you... uh... advised me too. I do realize I made my original post a bit self centered, and I'm sorry for that. I truly did not mean to make this about me, my comment about me being ""uncomfortable with her being in this show"" was extremely inappropriate. I realize that now. I (surprisingly) do care about this person and have had previous contact with her. (Again, sorry for being bratty.)

5201,Not the A-hole,"Edit: So a couple of details I wanted to add. First, N's maternal grandparents are not in the running in this custody dispute. Currently, they are not even capable of providing for N as their home was foreclosed on 3 months ago & they've had to severely downsize since then. This is literally the only reason B has her own place/a job now with N living with her full time instead of the grandparents. I am also not capable of providing guardianship for N due to both health issues & insufficient income. 

As far as the custody dispute goes: A wants shared custody, with visitation from Thurs-Tues every other week. B wants to minimize A's visitation rights as much as possible & limit it to supervised visits only. She also wants mandated child support w/ backpay.

Let me be clear, I think they're both trying to be good parents - but they're definitely not trying their hardest & neither of them is very good. They've both disparaged each other in front of N, and/or made her uncomfortable expressing her affections to either parent while in the presence of both. They both have seriously short comings that have caused emotional trauma/hardship for N. Both parents have been investigated by CPS (presumably because they called on each other), both have been asked to submit to drug tests ( though I'm not sure if either ever did), & both have been given warnings by CPS social workers, though nothing much seems to have come from any of it so far as I know. I've always tried to keep clear of their conflicts with each other & remain  a neutral party for N.

I'm grateful for the advice on contacting a GAL or CASA, but I don't know if N was ever appointed one or how I would contact them discretely if they exist. I definitely don't want either parent perceiving me as picking a side & being the enemy, as both have tried to persuade me in past matters using N as a token of persuasion & threatening to cut me out of her life.",102,714,0.93,AITA if I refuse to testify at my niece's custody hearing?,cx3t4d,2019-08-29 17:12:03,NTA,1931,AITA
10297,Not the A-hole,"So long story short, my boss had to promote one person on our team to be assistent supervisor for days that the boss is absent. The choice was between me and one of my newer coworkers. The job eventually went to the other person. Of course, I really wanted this promotion, but I totally understand why they went for the other person and they are doing a good job.

Shortly after the announcement of the new assistent supervisor, I was left alone with two entirely new coworkers for a whole day and I was expected to show them everything and teach them how to do their jobs. No supervisors, just me being the only experienced employee for the whole day with two new guys. After our shift ended, the two supervisors (meaning my boss and the assistent supervisor) both showed up for an extra shift to film a promotion video. This annoyed me. A lot.

So I went and told my boss that now that there is an assistant supervisor, I did not feel comfortable being at work for the whole day with two new guys. Especially since both supervisors were available that evening. In my opion, one of them should have taken the day shift to supervise and help the new guys get set up, and not me. I feel like it's their job as supervisors to do so. I also told him that for this one time it was fine, but I don't want something like that to happen again.

Now, my boss said to the assistent supervisor that he thinks I'm being difficult about this, and he thinks it's due to me not getting that promotion. So am I being an asshole about this?

1243,Not the A-hole,"Ok. So here's the sitch:  


My folks are old, they are on the way out. Could be a couple of years, could be ten... could be sooner.  


So naturally they want to get their affairs in order and leave a will to divide up their estate to their children. Me and my 3 (older) brothers.   
Their estate consists of, 3 titles of land all side by side. One 12 acre lot (no infrastructure), one 120 acre lot (no infrastructure), and another 110 acre lot (house, pool, carport, underground spring water bore, fruit orchard, multiple unaproved sheds and storage facilities plus more). They also have some shares and savings.

Originally their idea was to leave the 3rd block which has infrastructure to two of my brothers to share, my other brother would get the large undeveloped block and I would get the smallest undeveloped block.

The shares would be divided out somewhat equally based on the value of each bequeathment.  
I wasnt thrilled by this as I would be getting less land than the others, although it does have some redeeming qualities - it has good road access and is easy to connect to the electrical grid. however it is TINY! at least compared to the other blocks and it's much less private and lacks the degree of natural features (rainforest) that I would value in a property.

I have also expressed that I would rather share the main block with one of my brothers than get the smallest block or would rather get the other larger block and less shares.

But tonight my dad showed me a new ammended will in which My oldest brother would get the large and only developed block, one brother would get the largest undeveloped block and I would get the smallest block with my other brother just getting the money.

My oldest brother is already well set up - he has a house that is already paid out in full. He has a business worth potentially millions. He is fuckin loaded relative to the rest of us. He also married a woman of no small means who is also set to inherit a reasonable estate from her elderly and ailing mother.  
But my parents are christians - and in the bible the oldest son gets the largest inheritence.

I don't have a house. I don't really have any savings at all. I am paying off $20,000 of debt with my partner to help keep her in the country so we can be together. She has no prospects of inheriting anything at all as her parents own practically nothing. And I think this new will is Bullshit. 

I told my dad as much. In gentler words (slightly).

But he thinks I'm being ungrateful. That many people don't get anything and that I'm getting something and should be happy with what I get and shouldn't see any issue with the new will.

The child was in a high chair at the edge of the table sort of in the walk way but not really obstructing it.

Grandmother handed the baby a fork to play with and kept saying no, no, sh, etc. She eventually moved to the corner of the booth and left baby to cry and now slam the fork on the table. Mother returned and took out her phone again. Every so often she'd pat the baby's head or hand but it was clear that the baby wasn't going to stop crying soon. 

It was loud enough that I couldn't concentrate on my conversation and I started to worry that the baby needed something, so I leaned over and said ""Excuse me, sorry to bother you but I think your baby might need something."" 

Grandmother ignored me. Mother told me that she preferred to let him cry it out. 

I said I understood but he'd been upset for about 15 minutes at that point. Mother told me to mind my own business. So, I did.

Well, my wife disagrees. She thinks it's a sign of teenage rebellion - I told her I doubt that since my daugther asked us if that would be and acceptable present - and is worried people will think she's ""rowdy"" and that our family will look like we have problems. 

I tried to talk it over with her, but she thinks it'll result in her grades getting worse and her slacking of in general. (I really don't see the connection.)

I love my daughter and know how badly she wants to dye her hair, so would I be the asshole if I just took her to get her hair dyed for her birthday?

//edit: woah, getting lots of different opinions on here.
to clarify since someone asked: 
yes, my wife isn't the biological mother, i am, in fact.
my daugther is the child of my ex-boyfriend, but i've been together married to my wife since my daughter was four.

After reading your replies I agree, I shouldn't go behind my wife's back, but, being honest, I don't agree with her reasoning.

My solution would be to tell her and explain to her why I want to take my daughter to get her her dyed and why I disagree with her on this.

If I'd go with that, would I still be the asshole if I take my daugther to get her dyed *after* telling my wife why I am doing this?

//final edit:

First of all, thanks for your opinions.
many of you suggested to use dying hair as a reward/letting her get blue hair and dye it back if her grades slip - while I understand what you think, I won't think it's a good idea. I don't want to treat hair dye as a privilege for behaving well, I think she's old enought o decide on her own.

More importantly though - I talked to my wife and rven showed her this post. While she still opposes blue hair, she sees that she was too controlling.
All three of us sat down and I'm happy to say we found an agreement and my daugther is getting her hair dyed a darker reddish-purple, which she is happy about, too. My wife also said she'll think about other colours once she sees how this one looks.

15980,Not the A-hole,"Sorry for formatting, in mobile. Throw away. I keep on having these guilty feelings I need to ask some people about.


So I had been dating this girl for almost 2 years, we were both 20, young and in love, living in a small one bedroom apartment. We both went on to be diagnosed with depression after the incident and some other earth shattering events. But to the story at hand.


We were in one of those big relationship defining fights. Those fights that last for awhile and emotions come out so raw that our immature minds couldn’t properly comprehend all of it. The crux of it was simple. She was contemplating opening up our relationship so she could “sow her wild oats” in college. I’m as new age as they come but I had a problem with it and wanted to stay a monogamous couple. 


The fight progressed and in the end she wanted to take it all back. I couldn’t accept that, I needed to cool off, it felt like my entire world was spinning so I went into the other room to breathe. (It’s a one room apartment so I couldn’t go anywhere). While in the living room I heard the door to the bathroom slam. I heard her yelling about how she doesn’t want to live. I ran to the bathroom door scared.


I heard her frantically searching and slamming through the drawers. I heard a loud crack and a cry. Then it repeated, and repeated.


Throughout this time I was saying her name asking her to open the door and to stop. The bang and whimpers continued until I backed up and ran into the bathroom door. The door frame was weak and buckled allowing me in (we had a really cheap apartment, think projects level). When the door swing open I saw her hit her head on the wall again.


I immediately grabbed her, wrapped her in a weird bear hug type deal and brought her to the bed in the other room. There she laid next to me and cried for awhile. My head was still spinning but I knew I had to do something. I remembered that 9/11 in our area allowed texting. While she was laying down sobbing I quickly texted 9/11 our location, the situation and to please hurry.


My rational at the time was that she just seriously attempted to hurt herself. As selfish as it sounds I was nowhere near capable of handling the situation alone.


The police came, they talked to us apart. Took us in squad cars to a local hospital where she was admitted to a psych ward after a review. 


After talking to my friends on the matter I was told that I may have handled this wrong. I was informed of the terrible realities of inpatient care. As well as the stress it puts on a person going through a bad times. I feel like shit for hurting her.




TL:DR:
Girlfriend and I had a big fight over the state of our relationship. She locked herself in the bathroom and hurt herself. I broke in the bathroom and stopped her. Contacted the police and she ended up in inpatient care.

Don't get me wrong, he's nice. Doesn't insult me, occasionally pays for dinner (he's a student), says he loves me, etc. But he doesn't always take no for an answer. For example, on Friday he was over at my place. We were spooning in my bed watching tv and he tried to put his hand up my shirt to rest on my stomach. I said no and pushed his hand. He fought me back and clearly didn't care that I didn't want his hand there. Once it was settled on my stomach where I didn't want it he asked why, and I said ""I don't like when your hand is under my shirt like that."" Instead of pulling back and saying ""oh sorry"" he left it there and was like ""I think it feels nice"". He also puts my hand under his shirt the same way. I don't like that either.

Anyway, lately I've been dreaming of paying off all my debt, saving a bunch of money, and moving to Toronto (big city in Canada; basically our version of NYC). I also want to get hot AF, dye my hair, get a tattoo, and get my belly button pierced.

But, I want to do it alone.

I want to do it alone because I'm polyamorous so I would like to hold out for a relationship that better suits my needs once I move.

20541,Asshole,"I am truly hoping that this will be a N-A-H situation, but I fear there is a very really real possibility that I am the AH, therefore I am asking the public to weigh in. 
I (34F) found out about 7 months ago that I have breast cancer. 
No family history. No preexisting conditions. No concerns about breast cancer until I happened upon a lump during a routine self exam.
I immediately told/showed my husband (39M) the lump and I made an appointment with my primary care physician (PCP) who then referred me to an oncologist, and long story short, I have stage 3 breast cancer and roughly 5+ years to live.
After taking some time to seek out a counselor and join a support group (and accept my prognosis), my husband and I notified our families who were understandably DEVASTATED.
Our families (both of our parents are still together and each of us have a brother) immediately began asking us about treatment plans regarding chemo and radiation and my husband I explained that I plan on pursing any and all treatment options regardless of physical/mental/financial costs.
Our families were quickly put at ease and later on during the evening my mother and mother-in-law (who is actually a breast cancer survivor) pulled me aside and asked about my and my husband’s plans for potential children... My husband and I actually had plans to begin trying to conceive children at the beginning of this year and obviously things have been put on hold. Both my mother and mother-in-law suggested possibly trying for a baby BEFORE my treatments begin (I never began my treatments due to the current world events - my doctors did not want to lower my immune system in the midst of a p*ndemic), and I actually agree with their wisdom... If I have 5+ years to live then I will have plenty of time to birth and bond with a baby and if, gosh forbid, I leave this planet in ~5 years then I will leave my child in the all to capable hands of my husband and with the support of our families.
My husband is... less than on board with this idea. He hates the idea of conceiving a child while my life has an expiration date (however, don’t all lives have expiration dates?), and he does not want to be a single dad (although I have discussed with him at length that if I do die before him I want him to grieve and then date and find another partner).
Although I understand his position, I just can’t fathom the idea of dying before I give birth and meet my future child... I simply cannot face death knowing that huge part of my life will go unanswered. 
So, Reddit, AITA?

14238,Not the A-hole,"No throwaway because I don't think 85 year olds use Reddit too much.

Anyway, here's the scoop...

So my grandma moved in with us last year; she got too old to take care of herself so this was the next best option. I love her, and have always been very close to her, but this has turned into a different ballgame. Over the course of probably the last six months or so she's continued to get worse in terms of how she treats people, but I don't know how I'm supposed to respond to it. She's called my girlfriend a brat - to her face. She constantly guilts me if I'm not home that night to eat supper (even though I'm there like 4 times a week), and has just started being passive aggressive overall. Her and I share a bathroom, and she started locking my entrance to the bathroom to try and keep me out - plenty of small things like this that have just continued to add up.

My conundrum is this. She's 85, I'm not entirely sure if she understands what her actions are doing, and sometimes she speaks before saying what she wants. Each thing she does isn't enough to warrant getting pissed about, but all this added up seems like enough. I just don't know if this is a battle worth picking.

Also, other family members in the house have mentioned minor annoyances with her before, but she just turns it into a guilt trip saying she's a burden on the family and starts crying. WIBTA?

Edit: Not literally ""fuck off."" Definitely a fairly harsh conversation though because of previous experience with her guilting behavior since normal conversations haven't worked.

My boyfriend asked if I ever fantasized about anyone, and I answered him honestly. He got upset with me and said that he meant “celebrities or other unattainable people” and that he didn’t like me fantasizing about men I’m in such close quarters with. He also said it hurt that I wasn’t thinking of him when I was gone and that he thinks of me.

I told him that it’s not that I *don’t* think of him, but that it gets harder to visualize him the longer I’m gone. And I assured him that it’s all just harmless fantasy and that I’d never actually *do* anything because I would never cheat on him, and that even if I wasn’t with him the last person I would shack up with is someone I’m going to be *stuck on a submarine* with because that’s a recipe for disaster, and he said that I just didn’t understand because I was a girl and I took offense to him just brushing it off as me not understanding, and told him it was totally unreasonable for him to dictate what I *fantasize* about when I’m only faithful to him.

My grandmother has never fully accepted that Joe is gay, and has been very dramatic about the boyfriend. Recently, at a family get together, Joe ran his hands through Greg's hair and kissed him, in full view of the family. It was not performative, it was not drawn out, just a quick kiss, almost nobody even noticed(they where off to the side, not actively participating  in the convo or anything). Well, Grandma noticed and is extremely upset. She has told everyone that she will only come to the party if Greg is not there. The whole family agrees, and is saying that it was disrespectful for them to kiss in front of everyone, and that he shouldn't bring Greg, out of respect for our grandmother. 100% if Joe was in a straight relationship and they kissed in the same manner, it would be a non issue, as the whole fam is very affectionate and all about pda. This is ONLY because Greg is a man, and it is a gay relationship. 
She has yet to broach the subject to me directly, but when she does Im going to tell her to not come. I refuse to rescind Greg's invitation, just because my grandmother (and a handful of other relatives honestly) are bigots.

5160,Not the A-hole,"I met this friend nearly a decade ago. We hit it off immediately and stayed close since. One of the staples of our relationship has been honesty and openness. 

So, when they asked me to be in their wedding party, I gladly accepted. I got added to multiple group chats to organize the wedding party plans, and I made sure to keep up whenever somebody posted an update.

Fast forward a few months, two weeks before the wedding to be specific. My friend messages me telling me that they felt I hadn’t been “engaged enough” and they questioned whether I actually wanted to be in their wedding. I apologized and attempted to assure them that if my actions implied that I wasn’t interested that it was not my intention; I was genuinely excited about being a part of their special day. 

This friend gave no prior indication that they were upset or that they felt I hadn’t been engaged. It was only two weeks before the wedding that they chose to address it. At which point they decided they didn’t want me in their wedding anymore. I was seriously dumbfounded. I had no indication that anything was wrong, and the extent of involvement I could’ve had prior to the wedding was replying to the group chat, which I didn’t view as necessary because I didn’t see the majority of people actively participating. 

They didn’t particularly care for my apology or attempts to rectify the situation. They entirely ignored me and chose to remove me from all of the wedding party group chats. 

Following this, they sent me a message saying that they “hoped I would still attend as a guest.”  I replied saying that it would be humiliating and exhausting to show up and have so many people know that I was removed from the wedding party. So I updated my RSVP to indicate that I wouldn’t be attending.

17139,Asshole,"I've recently started dating someone (though we've been friends for a long time) and we decided to take a weekend mini-break, but were having trouble picking where to go. I was having drinks with a friend of mine, and she mentioned that she and her boyfriend were spending their 10 year anniversary in a small town/village, around an hour outside of London. It sounded like the perfect destination, as neither my partner nor I had been before and it was very convenient to get to. 

By coincidence, the weekend we'd chosen to go away was the same as my friend's anniversary trip. My partner asked if I thought they might have a problem with us going to the same town on the same weekend as them. I said it wouldn't have bothered me in the reverse situation, and I doubted they'd care either. Yes, it's a small town, but we weren't booking the same hotel or anything. I doubted we'd bump into each other. 

   We booked the trip and I mentioned it the next time I saw my friend. She froze, went very quiet, and became awkward for the rest of the evening. That night, I received a long, angry, text from her (usually, very placid) boyfriend. He said he couldn't understand why I'd chosen to book the same holiday as them, and that I had in effect ruined their anniversary. He also claimed that they when I'd mentioned I was looking for a place to go, they specifically asked me to chose somewhere else, though I honestly have no recollection of this. I think they were mainly upset that I'd decided to take someone I've been dating for two months on the same trip they'd planned for a significant anniversary. 

 I called to apologise, and he did accept, though he also insisted on providing me with an itinerary of the restaurants they'd booked over the weekend so we could make sure we'd avoid being in the same place at the same time as them.

12560,No A-holes here,"Hi all,

Our daughter just graduated from University with a degree in art. We (the parents) work as doctors and always tried to steer our daughter towards a high paying profession but her passion for art throughout school was very strong. When it came time for her to apply to University we told her that we won't pay for tuition if she studies something that doesn't have a good rate of return. She borrowed around $150k (NZD) of student loans to do her art degree and now she has a job that pays significantly less than the average wage doing some casual painting for small studios and her overall prospects don't look good - almost 100% of her paycheque goes on a rented apartment that she shares with two other people.

We haven't told her, but we're going to pay off her student loan debt this year so she can be debt free.

We (parents) want to sell our house and leave the country, we're looking at moving from New Zealand to Europe so we can enjoy skiing in the winter and french vineyards in the summer. We're in our 50's now so we feel like we've earned the right to start enjoying our lives rather than continuing to live in the city.

Our daughter recently asked if she could move back in with us in order to reduce her living expenses, we told her that we are planning on moving to Europe. She suggested that we let her stay in our house after we leave; we really need to sell the house as we need the money. She is incredibly angry at us for ""abandoning"" her. We feel that as a 22 year old adult, she should be able to take care of herself, we gave her access to the best private schools in the area, the best after school tutors and her grades were A's across all subjects. She chose to live the life of a suffering and poor artist despite us trying to get her interested in medicine, law, business etc. We tried not to push her too hard towards things that she had no interest in but we really did try to show her that art isn't going to let her live the kind of life that she became accustomed to when she lived with us (ski trips, nice houses, restaurants etc).

Are we the assholes?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I just want to point out that we HAVE NOT had an ""I told you so"" moment with her where we make her feel bad for studying art. We love our daughter greatly but we really want to retire and get out of this city living.

&#x200B;

Second edit: looks like I need to add some more context in order to stop the accusations of abusive father. I have supported her passion for art her entire life with every fibre of my being. When she chose her degree and her University, I just sat down with her to look at average salaries over the lifetime of various careers, she still chose art, we supported that choice despite being worried for her. She completely supported us retiring to France, she was excited for us and for all the skiing she would get to do with us. She only got upset when we told her we are selling our house (not her childhood home). She studied at Oxford in the UK, she tried to live in the UK post-grad but couldn't get a good visa due to not securing work with a company that could sponsor her, turns out there's not much demand for what she does.",402,327,0.89,AITA For leaving our daughter without money or anywhere to live?,bp5awk,2019-05-15 23:33:31,NAH,3178,AITA
18653,Not the A-hole,"My mom has a BIG family. She the oldest sibling out of 4, and had her kids (i'm the oldest) when she was in her late 30's. The other siblings all had kids in their early 20's, so my cousins are more like aunts & uncles to me, as we have an almost two decade age gap. 

Anyways, when these cousings got married there were a few younger kids in the family at the time. All of these cousins decided they wanted a ""no kids wedding"". Well, their idea of a no-kids wedding was *nobody under 18.* I won't lie, I was pretty peeved that at the age of 17, I was being excluded because they didn't want a bunch of kids running around their wedding (the oldest was 5 at this time). 

It was *not* a drinking thing, my 19 year old cousin was allowed to go because ""he's an adult"". We're in the US, so 21 is the legal age. He was also a partier, typical frat boy. I was a pretty quiet teenager who just wanted to celebrate with the family I grew up around.


So, i'm in my early 20's and have been dating the same person since early high school. Unless something tragic happens, I don't see any future without them. We were at a family gathering recently, and a family friend was talking about their engagement. The topic switched to weddings, and I said I wanted a small-scale one, with no kids. One of my cousins piped up that ""you don't have to worry about kids ____, the youngest will be a teenagerby the time you'll get married!"" I told him ""no, I won't have any guests under 18. You all made it clear weddings are no place for anyone but adults"". 


I feel like i'm definitely being petty, but am I really the asshole here? I feel like they purposefully excluded me (again, the ""kids"" were a group of children under 5 and me(17). Not exactly the same thing). I don't think its unreasonable to enforce the same rule, even if there won't be anybody under the age of 13 or so.

AITA?

EDIT: most people are saying that I would be an asshole. I accept that it would definitely be an assholish rule to implement. I was being petty.

19973,Asshole,"To celebrate my daughters 13th birthday and becoming a teenager, we thought it would be nice to have a day out and get makeovers.  My daughter was the one that suggested the idea and was very excited.

I told my husband we were going out to get makeovers done and he didn't say anything at the time.

My daughter and I had a wonderful day out. Given she was a now teenager, we decided to make it extra special by doing some 'teenager things'. She wanted some piercings done so we first went to the piercing shop where she got her nose pierced and 2 cartilage piercings on  one side (she already had 3 in each lobe).

We then went to the salon where I allowed my daughter to get acrylic nails, hair coloured pink and makeup done. I also got my hair done but only got a purple streak myself given I couldn't have anything too extreme for work.

My daughter was so proud of her makeover and was excited to go home and show her father. Unfortunately when we got home he did not not look too pleased and said it was a bit much and said she should was off the makeup and remove the piercings as she was too young.

When our daughter went to bed, I got told off about the whole saga. My husband told me that our daughter was too young and I shouldn't have encouraged such things. He said he should have also been consulted about the piercings and hair. I told him that I did tell him we were going for makeovers but he had a different idea of what this mean and thought just a hair cut. I also told him that he did not seem to mind when when I took our daughter to get her ears pierced the first 3 times and he then went on about that he didn't even know that she had her ears pierced more than once before today...I find that very surprising.

10790,Asshole,"So last year my mom turned 60 and my sister asked my brother and I if we should not gift her a little family vacation with us three kids, our partners and our children (my niece from my sister and my son), since earlier that year our father died and my mom could do with a little family time. So we both agreed and planned the vacation more than half a year in advance (time and location-wise). The trip was planned to last four days. 

So one week before the trip I call my sister to make last arrangements and she tells me that she, her husband and my niece will leave one day early (saturday around 2 pm) instead of sunday around noon so that my niece could go to sleepover party. After the phone call I talked to my boyfriend about it, telling him that I felt disappointed that they want to leave early, especially since it was my sisters idea to do the trip in the first place and we planned it long in advance. 

I might add, at this point, that I was never a big ""family person"", my family is quite big and I never really enjoyed spending time with them. I don't hate them, but I don't really love them either. Although I get along ok with my siblings, we still get on each others nerves much more easily then with friends. This is why I was never super excited to do this vacation in the first place but agreed because it is a nice thing for my mom.

So to come back to the point, my boyfriend agreed that it was kind of disappointing that they wanted to leave early, especially for such a (seemingly) minor reason as a sleepover. So we formulated a text (trying to be as polite as possible), saying we found it regrettable that they leave early, that we did not understand why a sleepover is so important that you have to cut long made plans short and asked if it maybe would be a possibility to drive her to a trainstation where she could take a train for 40 minutes (she is 9 y/o) and be met at the trainstation by a friend to be picked up so that my sister and husband could stay for the whole trip. She replied that she could understand that we felt this way and it was within our rights to say so but they would still leave early. 

Fast forward to our trip, some other issues arose and we (my sister and I) had a fight the first day of the trip, where she disclosed that she was very mad at me for my ""passive agressive"" text and started crying that the party was very special to my niece because a recent session with the school counselor revealed that my niece had almost no friends and the sleepover was with her one very good from kindergarden that she did not see very often because they since moved to another part of town. All of this was total news to me. She then revealed that she told my mother, brother and his girlfriend the whole story and they therefore never had a problem with them leaving early.

19934,Asshole,"For a little backstory, my parents were both 19 when I was born. They'd split up while my mom was pregnant and my mom didn't even let me see my dad until I was 13. She also didn't contact him herself or ask him for child support during that time. He spent some of that time in prison for possession of marijuana. When I met him, he'd moved on and had a new girlfriend.

My parents had a huge falling out when I was 15, around the time my dad's girlfriend had my baby brother. And she took him to court for child support and won.

It's been almost 10 years. My dad now has a steady job for the first time in his life. He and his girlfirend broke up, after they had another kid, my baby sister. And my mom's getting a bunch of back child support because the state is garnishing his wages.

She started complaining how they didn't garnish his tax return this year as well, like they did last year. I told her that she shouldn't be so greedy because he's fighting for custody of my brother and sister, both under 10, and he's been struggling to pay his rent. She said ""good for him. Look at all the years I suffered with you"". I lost my temper and yelled at her about how she shouldn't want anyone to have a hard time the way we did and I think it's horrible that she'd ever think that it's good for anyone to struggle with money and she should tell the court to stop making my dad pay back child support because I'm in my 20s and it's not like she needs it anymore. I told her that it was her fault that my dad was struggling with money to begin with, which was stretching the truth a bit, and that she shouldn't be making my brother and sister pay for whatever mistakes my dad made with her and that they could be living a better life if she'd just back off.

I know my yelling probably crossed the line. But AITA for telling my mom she shouldn't be so happy to get child support when it's one of the reasons my dad is struggling financially?

Edit to add: A lot of you are saying from a financial situation, my mother deserves the money. And I understand that. Even with help from my grandparents, we weren't in the best position when I was my brother and sister's age. But she's doing much better now and has an income. She doesn't need the money right now. And I know the money from taxes hasn't come in yet. My dad's tax preparer let him know that he would be getting his whole return this year and it wouldn't be garnished. He let her know when he found out so that she wouldn't expect anything. She's been complaining about it for a few weeks, I guess.

2312,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: My ex and I adopted 3 cats from a rescue. When you adopt you sign a contract that says if you can’t keep the animal it needs to be returned to the rescue. We both signed. Ultimately we divorced and I kept the cats.

I’ve since remarried and been with my husband for 3 years. He has expressed his frustrations with the cats almost daily. He refers to them as “my cats”, he has said multiple times that he hates them, that they are annoying/stupid, he always has a complaint, even going as far as to put energy into situations that haven’t occurred yet. As an example of that, we want to buy new couches and he says they will just claw them up, they destroy everything, etc. I feel like they are really good cats as far as cats go; however, I have become increasingly allergic to them which is a concern for me.

Issue: This morning he was upset with the cats for meowing. I texted my ex to put my feelers out if he would be interested in having them back. I texted him because he has cared for the cats before, they know him, and he wanted them just as much as I did all those years ago. Also, he’s the only other person that signed the adoption contract, so he’s the only one that can take them back.

My husband was very upset when I told him. He said I should have talked to him first because it’s a family issue and not asked my ex which took me aback as he has always made it clear they are “my cats”. He also said that if I wanted to get rid of them, it would have to be because I wanted to and not because of him, which is what I think the real issue is. I think he’s offended that I took action on his persistent dislike of the cats.

The cats could be around for years and if he hasn’t found peace with that yet he’ll be complaining forever, which has honestly worn me out at this point. It stresses me out. I don’t know what to say. The cat is a cat. Sometimes they’re inconvenient. Sometimes they throw up. What’s more, he thinks I should apologize for the cats when they do something irritating. I’m not going to apologize daily for a decade and I feel like that further creates a divide of “my cats” versus “our cats”. I feel like he should’ve accepted the cats back when we got together. It’s not like I hid the number of cats I had. It’s also because of this that I don’t feel like he should be getting upset that I simply asked my ex if he’d be interested. You can’t hate “my cats” and then get upset when I look into re-homing them.

I told him we would have discussed it if my ex actually showed interest in them and if he was a viable option. Obviously I don’t want to inconvenience my husband for years and have him be unhappy in his own home and I want my cats to be wanted and cared for.

Partly I felt this way because my therapist and I have been talking a lot lately about truth and the dangers of holding my truth inside. She didn't tell my I had to tell my kids, but she did say I would probably struggle to move on and gain closure as long as I had to keep pretending like my marriage was a happy one. It would be years of having to keep up the facade which would only keep that wound raw. She was right about it. Even though my daughter is upset I do feel better now that I can finally stop pretending like my marriage was anything more than a sham and loveless for the most part.

The other factor which led me to tell my daughter was some of her comments about my marriage but moreso one comment she made about our parenting. She didn't say she loved her mother more than me or that I was a bad father to her, but she said in her own way that she thinks her mom made more sacrifices for our family and the kids than I did which is why she admires her so much. It's the first time she has ever said anything like this to me, and I would be lying if I said it wasn't devastating to hear that. 

It's true that I was not able to be as present as my wife at all times since for parts of my marriage I was the sole provider and had to work late, but I attended nearly every event, game, recital, and special event my kids had. It was even more hurtful because at one point our wife was planning to leave me and our kids to start a new life with her affair partner while I would never have even given a thought to doing something like that. It wasn't even a brief thought of hers. She had already made plans to do it but changed her mind at the last minute. 

When I told my version of events to my daughter, she became very angry, which I understand. She told me I should never have told her this and I was selfish for not keeping this to myself. She hates me for ruining the image she has of her mother and her memories of her, and she told me not to even think of telling her siblings. If I do she says she is done with me.

It is hard for me not to be frustrated with my daughter because her immediate response was to defend her mother and blame me for not going to my grave with this secret, even if it meant many more years of pain. I am not sure if I will tell my other kids or not.

9334,Not the A-hole,"Hi! So this is something my mom talked to me a while ago, but I was just kinda thinking back to it. 

So I’m super in to baking. I find it fun, plus I get a little snack at the end of it. My sister is gluten sensitive, so must of the stuff I make, she can’t eat. 

My mom told me a while back that I should start making stuff for her. There are a few reasons why I don’t want to do that. 

1. Most of the stuff I make is my first time making it. My logic is that if I change the recipe and it comes out bad, I won’t know if it was something I was doing, the gluten free ingredients, or the recipe. 

2. I don’t like gluten free stuff. I’ve made some things for her before, and 90% of it I haven’t liked. Everyone says it tastes good, but I really don’t like it, and if I’m doing something for fun, I want to be able to like it. 

3. I’ve made gluten free stuff for her before, and she didn’t eat it! For Valentine’s Day, I made macarons, which are gluten free. I made about 20 and she had maybe 1. For her birthday, I made gluten free brownies, and she didn’t eat any, and a cake, which she had one (tiny) piece of and then no more. 

Obviously if it’s for her birthday, I’ll make them gluten free. But I’d just rather not make something I’m not gonna like and she’s not gonna eat.",60,52,0.88,AITA for not making gluten free baked stuff for my sister,c9iulq,2019-07-05 17:43:01,NTA,1281,AITA

478,Not the A-hole,"I (24f) am an expectant mother of triplets and recently widowed. My late husband passed away at 28 suddenly 2 months after we found out I was pregnant. I can honestly say he was the love of my life and it devastated me losing him. He was the kindest, loving, most compassionate man I've ever met.

My inlaws though are a different story. My late husband came from money whereas I didn't, they were harshly judgmental from day one because I come from a very poor background and was working a minimum wage job while supporting my siblings and parents. In their minds, I was some gold-digging whore. They had even gone as far as to suggest that our children aren't his. I did everything to assuage their fears to no avail even insisting we signed a prenup before we got married. To put it frankly these people if they even acknowledge my existence are cold and extremely passive-aggressive. 

When my husband passed they tried to blame me for the accident (I wasn't even there), they tried to contest his will that named myself and his children as beneficiaries, they even tried to usurp his funeral and steamroll me into accepting what they wanted. But oddly enough in spite of the actions they say they want to be involved in their grandchildren's lives and that family is the most important thing.

The only saving grace through all of this has been my late husband's sister who has tried to keep the peace. She insists her parents are just grieving and they will come around especially after our children are born. I've told her I do not think that I want them involved especially if they are going to continually bad mouth me. She thinks I WBTA if I went through with this, that I am allowing my hormones and grief to cloud my judgment on what's right for my children. That family is important and them having their grandparents in their lives will be a good thing. 

That babies bring out the best in people and things will settle down between us all once they're here.

423,Not the A-hole,"I grew up a Hindu, she grew up Muslim. My family never pressured me into following any faith (only thing they did was not allow beef inside the house) while hers were a lot more devout. I’ve maintained a laissez-faire attitude to it but my wife, ever since I met her has been vehemently against religion. 

As neither of us are religious, we agreed we wouldn’t raise our children (6m and 4f) in any faith.  That was working fine until a couple of months ago when my grandfather died. I realised most of my great memories of him came from my childhood where he would tell me the myths and legends from Hindu texts such as the Mahabharata and Ramayana, so I decided to use them as bedtime stories I’d tell them to my kids. In my view, they aren’t overtly religious and if you replace the word ‘god’ with ’king’ you’re pretty much set. The stories have morals, like telling the truth and being generous and kind, which are values I think the kids should learn. However, when my wife found out she firmly asked me to stop with the Hindu legends because she felt it went against our agreement, and I said I would. 

Now yesterday, she walked in on me reading to our kids from a child’s version of Greek Myths and Legends. She got far more upset saying that I was doing the same thing I’d agreed to stop doing. 

At this I said she was being ridiculous. First, I thought she objected to the Hindu stories because Hinduism is still a very popular religion and that might influence them, while with the Greek myths it’s a dead religion and no one is encouraging them to worship Zeus. Her next point was that she didn’t want mentions of God at all in the house, which I said was ridiculous. The kids were probably exposed to the concept of deity by now, either through speech, or films or tv. Besides, in my view not raising them to be religious is not the same as completely ignoring the idea of god. Finally, I said that her reaction was perhaps too severe because at 4 and 6, they probably thought it was a cool story about a bloke fighting a lion and not about a power to which they should be obedient.",143,793,0.96,AITA for telling my wife she needs to relax her attitude about religion?,fzzpo1,2020-04-12 16:25:39,NTA,2097,AITA
4510,Everyone Sucks,"So I just started at a new company, and when I was bored I searched through the company's network and saw a few people I went to college with, including one girl who I dated in college.

The relationship ended amicably, and she sent me a heartfelt letter when she broke up with me because it was due to us both being too busy to make the relationship work.

Over the next year, we were both on a sports team and could never get along. We argued constantly, and the rest of the team knew we didn't get along, but didn't know we dated. 

When I found the friends in the company's network, I set up a day for all of us to get lunch. One person invited my ex without asking me.

When we met ready to leave, the person who invited her must have noticed my facial expression when he told me she was meeting us there, and asked why I was upset if she and I only ever argued on the team, and it probably would be fine now.

I explained that we had dated, so it probably wouldn't ever be great, particularly with the amount we'd have to be careful to keep every conversation in the workplace professional.

He lost his mind at the idea of her and I dating. He told the rest of the group, and everyone was in disbelief. It became the topic of the day, and they continued asking for details as we went to lunch.

When we got there, my ex denied ever dating me. She said I was lying, she would never date me, I wasn't her type, wasn't attractive enough, etc etc. As this was going on and my friends began to think I made it up, I pulled out my phone and read her letter she sent when she broke up with me that went on and on about how she loved me, saw us marrying someday, etc and then showed the group the picture of it with her signature at the bottom.

She began to cry, left the restaurant, and is now saying (a few hours later) that it was uncalled for and a breach of trust, but I don't see how her lying wasn't a breach of trust either. My friends seem torn about whose side to take. AITA?

Edit/INFO: No I don't have any pictures of us when we were dating. I have a new girlfriend now so I deleted all previous pictures with any exes.

17417,not the a-hole,"**Update: I had a talk with my mum last night after posting this. I realised that her going through my stuff made me really upset and I said this to her.

After negotiating with her, I have changed the passcode on my phone so she can't access it. Part of this problem was that I was too scared to speak up about this all along, but now I know it's reasonable to do so.

Also, since a few comments asked, I am 15 years old. My post was slightly satirical of my compliance to my mom, so that's why it seems like it's written by a parent.**

**TL;DR-Mom is very invested in my social life to the point of going through my phone constantly and telling me what to say to my friends. As a result, I lie to her a lot and I fear it's getting out of hand.**

My mother goes through my phone, my text messages, emails, everything. I know she does it because she loves me and wants to protect me, but I can't help but feel a bit annoyed.

I've talked to her about how I'm uncomfortable with this, but she always replies with 'Your friends' parents do this too', which is probably true. She says the only reason I'd want privacy is because I have things to hide, which is also true.

I wouldn't mind too much if she just read my texts. What annoys me is the constant over-analyzing of what my friends say. If one of my friends sends an emoticon, for example, my mum will read really deep into it-'That face looks mocking. They're making fun of you.' She constantly misinterprets jokes and sarcasm. I've tried to communicate this to her numerous times, but she just says I'm too naive(she's not wrong though, I always tend to think the best of people). 

She often tells me what to send back to my friends. I have to send what she wants me to, or I'll get yelled at for being socially incompetent. She always feels guilty and says sorry for it afterwards though, so I forgive her.

I, on the other hand, treat her awfully when she goes through my phone. I get mad and sometimes yell at her. I try my best to never be angry at people (since I dislike it when people lose their temper), so this is really childish and hypocritical of me.

She just wants me to become a better person socially and I admit I do send a lot of dumb stuff if she doesn't tell me what to write. But overall, I feel like this social dependency is only going to become harmful for both me and her. 

It's humiliating when she takes my phone to search through it-like I have no personal agency. But I also seem to have no limits when it comes to lying to her now-I'll lie about my daily life for *my* benefit, to get out of trouble or to avoid her freaking out about small things.

Even though she’s under 18 for holidays I always get my daughter a couple of scratchers that I will cash for her. My dad used to do the same for me and it was fun even if I didn’t win. The only rules I made about them are anything over a hundred dollars goes into a savings account for when she’s older.

I decided to give my stepdaughter some lottery tickets too. I had asked my wife about it beforehand and she was going to have the same rules with the money except she would be the one to hold onto anything over a hundred for her daughter since we keep our finances mostly separate.

My stepdaughter scratched hers and won $10. My daughter scratched hers and won $300. So I cashed them in and gave my daughter $100 and my stepdaughter the $10. 

My stepdaughter was disappointed and my wife thinks I should have split up the money evenly so each of the girls got at least $55 to spend and $100 to save since the ticket and money were technically mine legally.

I don’t think splitting up my daughters money would have been fair to her. I certainly wouldn’t have made my stepdaughter to give mine any of her winnings if she won more.

Edit. Messed up on math. After taking out the $200 and splitting it up they  would get $55 spend.

Edit 2. A lot of people seem to have missed the part where I explained the rule I had about them, so I’ll repeat it. I am not keeping any of the money for myself. The $200 I didn’t give my daughter went into her savings account that she can use when she’s older.

Edit 3. They’re $1 scratchers. The grand prize is under $1000. So no need to worry about one of them winning thousands or millions.

She ended up asking me some stuff about dealing with divorce as a child and how my mom handled it. And she did ask why the divorce happened. In hindsight, it was an inappropriate question but I've worked with her on several occasions so we were pretty casual acquaintances.

I straight up told her it was difficult because my dad cheated on my mom with his now wife. It wasn't out of spite. I just don't think I needed to lie for their mistakes.

She was shocked, was sympathetic and we finished up our work.

My dad's wife was the primary earner and my dad called me saying that I've made providing for their kids difficult. And that I shouldn't have taken out my anger at him on their finances.

I'm of the opinion that I was asked a question and I replied honestly. Just because my dad and his wife are ok with lying doesn't mean I have to be. I told him that and hung up.

I am an artist who often buys supplies and other things on Etsy. Generally, I like the platform, and given recent events, I think it's a good way to support local businesses.  It was my birthday recently and so a few weeks ago I decided to treat myself to something shiny. I found a matching ring and pendant set from a local seller on Etsy, and even though it was a bit pricey, I've been fortunate enough to continue working at home and figured why not. 

The package arrived quickly but when I opened it I quickly became disappointed.  Inside the envelope, the packaging for a nearly $500 set was two smaller dented and roughed up cardboard boxes with no lids taped to the same piece of paper. The large stones in the pendant and rings themselves were covered in chips and scratches the seller had not disclosed or made visible in any photos, so I left an honest review of 3/5 stars. In the review, I cited the above factors but also included that I thought the pieces were beautiful and that overall I was happy with them. I thought that was fair, and I tried to use polite language without value words to try to be unbiased. 

Within an hour I received an extremely rude message from the seller in response to my review, calling me ""nasty"" and ""mean"" for my review. In return for my two sentence review, I got a whole page full name-calling and a statement saying they had free shipping so I had no right to complain.

I didn't reply to the message, I simply took a screenshot of it and my review, and filed a complaint with Etsy. Whether or not Etsy will do anything about it, I don't know, but I thought they should know that sellers are using their platform to harass customers.

14049,Everyone Sucks,"So I knew this girl for a long time who I kinda grew up with, let's just call her Emily. So throughout secondary school me and Emily were kinda on and off every now and then, not fully going out but having light fun here and there. Then when we were about 16 it got a little more serious. We were each other's first time for everything up to sex, which we didn't have at that stage, and it was fun, but called it quits after a while. Then I got a girlfriend for a year, and I lost my virginity to her. That relationship ended really badly, and fast forward to when me and Emily are both 18 and in our final year of school. We were all out at the club one night and got drunk, then I ended up going back to Emily's house and we had sex. After that, we were kinda friends with benefits, having sex and other stuff often enough, but at the beginning before we did anything I said to her I didn't want a relationship because of the bad experience I had in the past, and was done with that stuff, to which she said no problem. So we weren't exclusive, yet she would get jealous any time I would mention another girl even though we are not together. Then one night she got with another guy, which I was fine with because like I said, we weren't going out. Then on New Years Eve, I got with another girl, and Emily saw us, and spent the night crying in the bathroom with her friends, and she wouldn't speak to me for a while. Then we made up and said it was fine for us to get with other people (our original agreement) and continued our FWB thing. I got with another girl then, and she absolutely cut me off, blocked me on everything and then got with other lads which I didn't mind, because that was our thing. I decided to end our FWB for good because she kept getting upset if I got with someone else, even though it was okay for her to do it. Now, any time we all go out to the club or anywhere, and I just do my thing and get with girls, Emily always ends up crying when she sees it even though we ended like 4 months ago, and even her friends are just like ""she needs to cop on"".

Fast forward to a few months ago when my stepdad sells the marital home. He had two weeks to move all of his stuff, including their hot tub. My mother helped with nothing because "" I haven't lived there in two years, why would I help?"". My stepdad didn't have time to sell the hottub, so he asked if myself and my spouse wanted it. If not, he was going to throw it out, because he just doesn't care anymore. 

My spouse and I agree to have it moved to our house and ask how much. My stepdad replies ""ask your mother, as far as I'm concerned your family and you can have it for free."" A week goes by, the sale finalizes, my mom knows we have the tub, we have made small talk about it. I ask her how much she wants for it, which unleashes a shit storm of crazy. 

She tells me that she is going for the cost of the hottub through her lawyer, as her and my stepdad had agreed to put the tub in storage apparently and sell it from there. I tell her that we can sell it from my house and she doesnt have to do that or I can put it in storage so she can sell it, or she can just give me a price. She replies "" your stepfather is manipulating you into fighting with me, he's just trying to fuck me over. Just you wait until we go to court, I'm bringing Gerry and Steph and they are going to testify that he's been threatening me. You're going to get a free hottub and you should bring popcorn because the show will be so good, the judge is going to ruin him.""

I became upset, told her she was being unreasonable, and that I would talk to her later. We haven't spoken since, and that was a few months ago. Yesterday, she sent me a rather formal text message, asking when I would be home so she could get her winter tires. We picked a time, and this morning a courier showed up to get her tires.

18218,Everyone Sucks,"Hello everyone,

Let's set the scene. I (32M) am married to my wife (31F). My parents are 56M and 56F. I have one sibling (29M), let's call him Drew. Drew was born with a severe genetic disorder. He has never spoken a word in his life, and can barely make grunts. He can only walk short distances, and even then, he has to be wearing his ankle braces. He will never have anything resembling a normal life. Doctors say that he has the cognitive abilities of a four- or five-year-old.

I feel terrible for him. His life has been wasted away because of something that nobody had any control over. My parents have been taking care of him for his entire life. It has caused me to become very distant from my parents. I wasn't neglected per se, but they devoted almost all of their energy and free time to Drew. I try to reconnect with my parents now, but it's minimal at best. However, we have started doing occasional Zoom calls over the past few months.

Unfortunately, there has always been a subtle expectation that my wife and I are supposed to take care of Drew when my parents are gone. Even when I was a kid, they asked me to stay alone with Drew for a while to ""practice"" taking care of him.

I am completely opposed to this. Caring for Drew would be a huge burden on my wife and I, and any future children we might have. It can cost thousands to take care of him, not to mention the hours of work we would have to put in just to keep him alive. My parents have kept trying to push it on me, but I try to change the topic.

My parents are getting older now, so this topic is becoming paramount. We just had a Zoom call two nights ago, and we started talking about Drew. My parents talked about their plans for the future. My wife and I are considering moving to a new city (we have a specific one in mind) before we start a family. My parents said that we should not move their because it will be difficult for us to take care of Drew.
I was fed up with their antics at this point, so I flat-out rejected it. I told them that my wife and I will make the decision that's best for us, not Drew. They tried to guilt me; ""What will happen to Drew once we can't take care of him anymore?""

I told them, ""The day after you die, I'm sending Drew to a nursing home and I'll never visit him again.""

My parents were FURIOUS. They said that my comments were ""extremely insensitive"" and ""cruel"". ""How could you do this to your brother?"" They asked. I told them that it would not be fair to force him on me for his entire life. I don't want to constantly take care of a disabled person and have him live in my own house. I just want to live freely.

I couldn't finish the explanation because they hung up on me in the middle. My wife wasn't home when the call happened, but I told her afterwards. She said that the language was harsh, but she agrees with the message.

8362,Asshole,"Tdlr at the bottom

Every couple of weeks me (f24) and my friends get together for a “classic movie night” at my house. We drink, joke around, and watch old movies deemed to be “important to film”. Good times.

The problem: one friend (23f) has been through an awful trauma recently which has affected her profoundly. Our group has really huddled around her to make sure she is okay and lend our support any way we can... but... in the last few times we got together she got triggered by the graphic scenes in the films we were watching and politely asks that we stop. (The first time was Rosemary’s Baby and the second was Taxi Driver, if that matters.)

Of course we all wanted to be sensitive so both times we immedietly turned it off and the group quickly dispersed after (kind of a bummer). Independantly, friends from the group have asked that I not invite her the next time, because we want to watch Clockwork Orange which will definetly be triggering to her. Since I’m hosting, it is up to me, but since I usually invite everyone via a group chat that she is in, it would require some maneuvering to exclude her.

God I feel like such a dick but my friends and I really want to be free to watch what we want without worrying about making her uncomfortable. WIBTA if I went out of my way to NOT invite her?

Tldr: My friends and I want to watch movies that our traumatized friend may find triggering - WIBTA to just not invite her anymore?

13295,No A-holes here,"I'm in a bit of a unique situation. My father is an immigrant from Canada, and my mother is American. Because of Canada's citizenship laws at the time of my birth, I am afforded dual citizenship by Canada (from my understanding, the US doesn't officially recognize dual citizenship, but kind of turns a blind eye in most cases for countries they're friendly with). 
I was in the process of requesting a citizenship certificate from Canada so that I could get a Canadian passport to travel more easily, and potentially live abroad. Right before I finalized the paperwork, I got a call from my brother. The company he works for contracts work from the American government occasionally, so he's required to have a certain level of security clearance to keep his job. The fact that our father is Canadian frequently throws red flags on his clearance checks, and he has to go through a bunch of extra steps every couple of months at work. After the most recent incident at work, he was informed that he also had to report any time he spoke with any citizens of foreign countries, including dual-citizens (which would be me, if I officially get the citizenship certificate). When he informed his work that I was in the process of becoming (or rather, certifying that I was) a dual-citizen, he was told that this might compromise his ability to keep his clearance, and as a result, may lose his job, if I were to do so. 

So Reddit, WIBTA if I ignored the risk, albeit slim, that my getting a citizenship certificate would cause my brother to lose his job?

To add some extra detail, I (28M) and my wife (28F) both have grad degrees and live reasonably comfortably, while my brother is the sole provider for his family of 4.

Also, his losing his security clearance was pitched as the absolute worst case scenario, he was told that most likely I would be asked to sit down for an extensive interview to confirm that I wasn't trying to conspire with some foreign power, but we there's no way of knowing what the process will be unless I actually pull the proverbial trigger and submit the application for citizenship.",31,57,0.94,"WIBTA If I applied for foreign citizenship, possibly causing my brother to lose his job.",bkcsfv,2019-05-03 20:01:25,NAH,2109,WIBTA

Said they should just break up since they obviously have trust issues and can’t handle being in a committed relationship. 

I was appalled. We’re been friends for years and at most we’d laugh at how crazy tumblr bios. But she never showed this kind of behavior to real people/in person. Our friends are all types of LGBTQ people. She was the first person I came out to. 

I asked if she knew what a polysexual relationship was. She just said “yea it’s what Projared, Heidi, and Holly did.” I explained to her what it was and that it’s not open relationship or glorified cheating. She just said it was weird and the guy was obviously a player. I called her an ignorant asshole. 

I got so mad, I left her at the restaurant (I paid for my drink) and drove home. I felt that if I stayed and continued to listen I’d cause a scene. 

She recently texted me saying after I left, the tables next us started talking about her. An older woman called her a bigot on the way out. She had to take the train home. She said it was just her opinion and that I’m overreacting. That I’m a terrible friend for ditching her.

The first day of me being in labor my in laws came by. We didn’t want them in the room while I delivered, he broke the news to them and he said it went well. It was his mother, father and his 2 brothers (11 & 16). My mother was still driving up during this time. It was okay for a while but my FIL and BIL’s started asking really inappropriate questions. Things about my parenting skills, my weight and my vagina. Eventually the nurse told them they had to leave because they were being loud and were disturbing other people. They left, upset, but would be back after the baby was born.

About 10 hours later my mother arrived and I was about ready to push. My husband told me he didn’t think it was fair his parents weren’t going to be there and wouldn’t let up on it. Finally I told him fine because it was their grandchild too and I did feel bad about  my MIL not being there because I actually did like her, she just has no control over her sons or her husband. MIL and FIL showed up around the time I started pushing. 5 minutes in I heard FIL giggling and I snapped and told MIL and FIL to get the fuck out and don’t fucking come back until visiting hours. I heard a lot of commotion but my mother was just keeping me focused on pushing. Eventually everything was done and I had a beautiful boy and my husband and I just enjoyed our brand new baby and finally got some sleep. 

The next day, my family and our close friends came but none of his family did. He was upset for sure.

We are having a good time. I ask the waitress for a refill on my soda and water as I had drank both of my glasses while others had drank their beers and what not - my kids had small kid drinks. The waitress continues to refill the beers and kid drinks but never my water or soda. The drinkers had 3-4 beers each, the kids had 2 refills each. I got nothing. I asked at the same times as everyone else. I’m not a monster. It got to a point where I was drinking the 3 beer drinker’s waters because I had nothing. We got our food. Still no refills for me. We were there for and hour + and the waitress never refilled my glass. I was pissed and thirsty. I paid for dinner and left a measly 5% tip. In the bill was a comment card which I was rude on. The next day I called corporate and complained as well -  as I should have at least gotten as many refills as the kids.

I spend the week with my mom and step-dad then my dad would take me for the weekend and he always had something plan. We'd go to Disney or we'd go fishing or wakeboarding. The only problem was that as I got older, my mom would make me stop talking about my time with my dad in front of my brother. She'd also either make me share gifts that my dad bought me or if I didn't want to she'd take them and give them to my brother until my dad picked me up. 

When it came to clothes my dad would have my stepmom take me shopping(she's a fashion writer). My mom would take my brother and me to the thrift store but she would once in a while take my brother to actual clothing stores but never for me. Earlier this school year, I hit a huge growth spurt and none of my clothes fit me properly. I asked my mom if she could take me shopping and yet again she was going to take me to the thrift store because only one her sons deserves new clothes. I told her to forget it and my stepmom and dad took me shopping to replace all my old clothes. My dad then suggested that I sell my old clothes to have some spending money.

I told her I told my dad they didn't fit me anymore so he bought me a bunch of new clothes and let me sell the old clothes. She got upset and told me I should've asked before I sold them. I told her my dad was someone and asked why she cares since my dad was the one that bought them.

7221,Everyone Sucks,"TL;DR: Bestie treated me like shit when I got engaged before she did. We work together but I don't talk to her and don't feel the need to explain why. 

""Ruby"" and I were friends from 5th to 7th grade. Ruby didn't talk to me for 9 years, then sent me a message out of the blue. She introduced me to her boyfriend ""Jake"" and his best friend ""Nick."" Nick and I started dating soon after. 

Ruby comes from a *very* rich family. Ruby is a very obnoxious person, and has always been self-centered, but she can be generous and a lot of fun. 

Nick and I got engaged. When we got back from our trip where we got engaged, Ruby wanted to go out to lunch. At lunch, Ruby complained that Jake hadn't proposed to her yet even though they'd been together longer. 

Ruby made Jake propose to her. Their wedding was September, Nick's and mine in December. Ruby asked me to be her Maid of Honor. I felt pressured to ask her to be my MoH, so I did what most people with the moral backbone of a chocolate eclair would do, and asked her to be my MoH. 

Ruby and I went shopping for her bridal shower, which her parents had offered to pay for, but at the end of her shopping spree she told me I was paying. I had about $150 to my name at that time and spent most of it on her.

The day of her wedding she was awful. I just kept my distance and did my job as MoH. 

A few days after her wedding, I told Ruby I applied for a CNA job at the hospital where she works. I am in nursing school. She is a new RN. There aren't many hospital CNA jobs in our area. She told me she hoped I got the job.

I got the job. Ruby was polite but distant. After a while, I asked why, and Ruby said ""I just don't want to be seen as playing favorites with the CNAs."" That hurt a lot. A lot of CNAs and RNs hang out outside of work on our unit, so it's not like it'd be weird. After that, I mostly stopped talking to her. 

I didn't ask her to do anything for my bridal shower. 

The day before my wedding she kept texting and calling. I was stressed and busy so I ignored her.

Later that day Ruby confronted me. She wanted to talk about her MoH speech. I finally put my foot down and told her she wouldn't be having a speech. Ruby is always sneaking in a cutdown and I didn't want to hear that at my wedding.

The day of my wedding, I had an allergic reaction in one eye. Ruby told my makeup artist to do me last and keep my brushes separate because I had something contagious.

22462,Not the A-hole,"this is an ongoing situation, and am currently writing this as my niece is having a full-on meltdown. so I apologize for any mistakes.

today was my day off and i decided to whip up a batch of pot cookies (cookies that have weed extract in them) so i can snack on them for the weekend. after they finish baking i left them out on a cooling tray so they can set. just as i finished cleaning up the kitchen i hear the door bell and went to answer, and surprise surprise it's my sister with 8yo niece and husband. it's been awhile since I've last seen them to it was a happy surprise. i let them in, and the smell of cookies still in the air, and niece goes bolting towards the kitchen. 

i instantly go chasing her and as i round the corner into the kitchen, niece had just grabbed a cookie and was about to eat it, quick on my feet i swooped in and grabbed the cookie out of her hand saying that these were adult cookies. which caused niece to start freaking out. my sister followed in and i explained to her that these cookies had pot in them and assured her i was able to take the cookie away from niece before she had ate any.

she instantly blows up at me saying i shouldn't have pot cookies out when there are kids in the house, i explained how i had just finished baking them and they were setting, and the fact that i didn't expect ANY children to be around (i am a single man, no kids), she asked if i had any thing that wasn't ""laced"" and unfortunately i didn't, by this point niece has locked herself in the bathroom and is crying.

and my sister gave me a big ol' lecture about having drugs in reach of kids, while i stand on the premise of, there wouldn't be an issue *if i had even known they were planning on dropping by today.* she called me a huge irresponsible asshole, and i responded ""well maybe if you taught your daughter to not just grab shit, we wouldn't be in this mess!""

she left to try to get niece out of the bathroom and i'm sat here typing this, am i really the asshole here? like i can understand not having drugs out in the open with kids around, and i never would - *if i had known there were going to be kids around.*

2127,Not the A-hole,"Sis has a young daughter. She and her husband have her in a nursery but work long hours, usually 8-6, and the nursery is open 8-5.

Mum offered to do drop offs/pick ups each day, so mum goes to their house around 7am. She collects my niece and drops her off at nursery, and then later picks up my niece from nursery, and then goes to my Sis' house to wait for them to get home.

This system has worked until recently. Mum changed jobs and now is unable to do the drop off/pick up.

I am 17 and still in school. School is 9-4. I have a job as a cleaner and work from 7-midnight. I have 3 hours between school finishing and work starting to do homework and grab some food before my shift. I'm in bed by 1 in the morning and sleep until 8.

Today I heard my mum on the phone to my sister. I didn't hear Sis' end but mum said ""well, we could always ask OP to help out"". After they hung up I got a text from Sis:

>Hi, OP. Mum said you're helping out with nursery. Husband and I really appreciate it as we could do with the help. Mum will sort you out a key to get in to the house. You need to be here at 7 to get her, and be there @ 5 to pick her up. Husband or I will be back around 7 to take her off your hands. Thanks again :)

I never offered to do any of that, nor had I indicated that I had the time/energy to do that. I texted back:

>I can't do that. I sleep until 8 because I work until gone midnight, I start school at 9, I'm there until 4 and I start work at 7. I don't have the time or energy to help you out.

Sis then replies:

>Mum said you would. You just need to be at my place by 7, you can drop Niece any time between 7 and when you start school. Look, we can sort something out so Husband or I leave 10 minutes earlier to give you time to get to work, but we can't arrive late/leave early by a full hour. I need you to step up.

This is when I got mad.

>WTF do you mean step up? I love Niece but she's your kid not mine. I'm not changing my schedule because you can't fix yours.

Sis didn't reply. Mum tried to give me the key and I asked why she signed me up for this when I don't have time. Part of me feels like a bitch for not wanting to help out my sister, as she is trying to work with me here. Mum pointed out that all I had to do was wake up a bit earlier to drop Niece off, the pick up doesn't clash with school or work, and my sister was willing to sort out something so she could leave work early and I could get to my job on time.

However, I am also really irritated that I wasn't even asked to do anything, I was told what to do and this is going to take a chunk out of my schedule. Without the full 3 hour gap I could probably still get a bite to eat but can't do my homework if I'm watching my niece, and in order to be at my Sis' house for 7, I have to get up at half 6 at latest, which means that my 7ish hours of sleep per day will go down to 5.

2222,Not the A-hole,"Hi everyone,

I (28M) am making this post because I really don't know what to do. My girlfriend (22F) is my first girlfriend in life. And I don't know if some things are just normal for a relationship to work or if some are just out of line. 

So I received a seasonal gift from my three young staffers at work. This is just a tradition in my country at this time of the year where young people pay their respects to elders (or in my case some kind of mentors). These three girls gifted me two bottles of instant crystallized coffee and a wallet. So I mentioned that to my girlfriend and she wanted me to give her the wallet. To some extent, I can understand her feelings. She also said it out loud to me: she doesn't like the fact that I keep a gift coming from a group of girls. So then I told her that I would get rid of the wallet on my own. Maybe I will donate it to someone. Or regift it to someone. But she couldn't accept it. She would like to have it and get rid of it by herself because she didn't trust me. Then I started to get a little bit mad. It is one thing that I do whatever I want with the said wallet or any other gift that I get. But it seems insulting to the people who give the present that my girlfriend can take over their gift to me and do as she pleases. So for now, I told my girlfriend that we would talk about it later. Maybe she is getting mad at me right now. But I don't want to talk about this whole thing at the moment. 

So please judge my case. Don't hold any punches. Let me know if I am the one who is unreasonable. As I said above, this is my first relationship, and I don't know which things are something I need to work on or which are the ones I have to put my foot down.",98,298,0.94,AITA for refusing to handover my girlfriend a present that I get from my female staffers?,di9aqs,2019-10-15 15:13:51,NTA,1714,AITA

The neighbor below me in apartment 2 is an elderly Hispanic woman. She’s nice, although a bit stand-offish. She’s given us some leftover food on a couple of occasions, and we’re friendly when we pass each other in the hallway.

There’s an elderly gentleman that we see occasionally that I believe is her boyfriend. He’s very nice and polite. 

Last night as I was walking into my apartment, this gentleman came out of their apartment and spoke with me. My Spanish is rusty, but essentially he told me that he’s having issues with his pension and couldn’t make payments on the internet bill. They are now sans internet. He then asked me if I would give him the password to our WiFi so they could watch television, use the internet, etc. He didn’t offer to pay anything, so I’m assuming he means use for free for an indefinite amount of time.

Put on the spot, I told him I needed to talk to my roommate first, which was in fact true. My roommate is also on the fence, which is why I’m here.

2. I get an internet stipend for work, so my roommate and I each pay $10/month for internet. I realize that’s extremely cheap so I don’t feel as though them using it for free is a legitimate reason to say no. 
3. They constantly have their adult children over. Every evening there are at least 5 people in the apartment. I’m worried that they’re all going to use it, slowing down the internet even more. 
4. I don’t think I can change the password to our WiFi, so if I give it to them, there’s no way to stop them from using for however long they want.

14515,Not the A-hole,"I live with my 25 year old sister and her two little girls 4 and 2. She recently started a job that is 2-6 pm and I’ve been watching them on my days off work. Here’s some background info to better understand the situation. 
 
I work 4-6 days a week usually all day. But I always work Saturdays and Sundays all day. She does not, she has those days off. She does not pay me for watching the children and I do not receive anything in return for doing the favor of watching her children. 

She got her job in January and since then when I watch them I usually clean up after them. They always make a mess with their toys and always spill their food. But I don’t mind the cleaning cause I might as well since I live here too. But I would always tell them when they made a mess to clean up after themselves. I’m trying to teach them good habits here. So on saturdays and sundays when I come home from work the house is always a mess. ALWAYS. Dishes are in the sink, there are toys everywhere, spilled juice is still on the floor, cracker dust is all on the couch. A mess and I’m tired so I try my best and clean up what I can. I’ve told my sister plenty of times that she needs to start telling them clean up after themselves. They start learning habits at this age and it gets kind of annoying when I have to tell them 10 times to pick up a toy. But she ignores me when I tell her that and doesn’t discipline them at all. 

So two weeks ago my sister went on vacation for a week. Before she left I cleaned the house spotless. Not a crumb in sight. And that entire week I made sure to have everything so clean you could eat food of the floor. The night they came back my nieces made a mess. Toys EVERYWHERE. Shredded cheese throughout the hall. And all of their luggage and clothing spread throughout the dining room. Again that night I told them to clean up after themselves. The next few days my sister had no work cause she came back on Friday and had Saturday and Sunday to chil. Well I worked all day Saturday Sunday and then Monday. In those 3 days my sister did not clean a thing. I get maybe she was tried from traveling but after having 2 days of chillin like can’t you at least broom? I know she hasn’t cleaned at all because we have this card game and she gave it to them to play with, which I have told her before to NOT give to them because they always throw the cards everywhere and we can never find all of them. That card game was still all over the floor in those three days she did not attempt to even pick them up. 

I feel like she is expecting me to clean because I’ve always cleaned up after them. But none of that is my mess and she had been home she could have cleaned. So for right now it’s now been almost a week and the living room, dining room, and kitchen are all a mess and I’m not planning on cleaning it anytime soon. I feel like she needs to clean up after them mainly cause she was watching them and they are her kids.

22004,Not the A-hole,"I (18f) am the manager at a pool, I have been the manager for 3 years (all the managers in this pool company are high school/college kids), everybody in the community knows and likes me. 

There is a lady named M and her son K; I’ve known them for two years. K is nonverbal and he has autism. This means oftentimes when we tell him not to run and to exit the pool for safety break that he does not listen. That is okay with us! There are a lot of disabled children who come to our pool and we do our best to accommodate them, and his mother had been very cooperative with us until this year. 

This year, she started allowing allowing K to swim in the deep end unsupervised. She sits on the opposite side of the pool, not in the water at all, and her son is not in arms reach. At first I thought that maybe she could not swim but it turns out she doesn’t want to get her hair wet 😐. K is 4 years old  and a very small boy, and the deep end is 4 ft deep, which is just deep enough for a small child to struggle. 

When my pool opened this year, in the first week alone I had to jump in the water to save him twice because his mother was not watching him and he began to struggle. His mother insists that he is able to swim bc he is able to stay afloat on his own. While this is true, he does not have the endurance to stay afloat for long periods of time. When he gets tired he often grabs random strangers or things to stay afloat and rest- this indicates to me and my lifeguards that he should not be swimming alone, because both times that he drowned were times in which he got tired and did not have anything or anybody to grab onto. After both times that i rescued her son I spoke to M to discuss that she needed to supervise K to prevent this from happening again and she insisted that he can swim by himself. Obviously he can’t, as I have had to save him twice. 
I told my supervisor about this and the next time he visited my pool while M and K were swimming he told her she had to have her son within arms reach or that she had to leave. She neither left nor supervised her son so he called the cops on her. 

The cops escorted M out and all the residents and M made a huge stink about it on Facebook, they are saying that we are ableist and racist (M and K are black). First of all I don’t think I am ableist bc I have never had this kind of problem with any other parents at the pool, whether their child is or isn’t disabled they will watch their kids if they can’t swim because that is common sense. Second of all, I don’t know what is so “racist” or “ableist” about wanting M to watch her son so that he stops drowning. It is so horrifying to watch a child swim knowing that if u take your eyes off of him that he might start to drown. 

AITA? I wanted to prevent her son from drowning again but not the neighborhood Facebook moms are mad about this and complaining to HOA.

Edit bc I’m getting a lot of questions about this: when you ask a patron to leave the pool and they say no then they are formally considered trespassing. We told M this and that if she stayed the cops would be called. She still did not leave so we called the cops to escort her off the premises. There was not really much else we could do bc we can’t physically force her off the premises, and letting her just stay instead of making her leave enables her negligent behavior.",440,3852,0.96,AITA?

I’m a 25 year old transgender man (FTM), from the UK, and have been living as my true self for about 5 years now, and never in my life have I had to deal with anything like this. My previous employers handled my transition amazingly even though they are a garbage company to work for.

I started working at my new job for the postal company about 10 months ago, I had to disclose my identity at my interview because I haven’t had time to change my passport over to my current name yet, but everything else I own is in the correct name.

Now, I have disclosed my identity to 4 people who I trust, because I’m very open about who I am but only to people I deem trustworthy to keep it to themselves because I don’t want be seen as essentially the gossip of the shop floor, and if I want to tell people it will be on my own terms.

Anyway, yesterday I was working with someone who trained me when I first started and she was talking about something and I disclosed that I’m trans to her because she’s a nice woman and she’s 100% not a gossiper. She then told me that she already knew I was trans, and I was shocked because how does she know if I’ve not told her? So I asked, and she said on my first day before I’d even walked in the building one of the managers said ‘you’ll be working with this new starter, and this is what their name used to be.’ I was absolutely livid at not only telling a, at the time, total stranger that I’m trans, but also telling her what my birth name was! Gobsmacked is an understatement.

I then found out that at the beginning of the week a different manager outed me to 3/4 people in a new section I would be working with, telling them to ‘be careful’ with me, and when they asked why, he told them because I’m trans.

I’ll be seeing my union rep first thing tomorrow morning because it’s unacceptable and seeing what my options are. I don’t think any of it was done out a malice but it was a very poor and misguided decision on their part.

So WIBTA if I take it all the way? Because people could lose their jobs over this, and I think I’d feel guilty about it.

Tl;dr: 2 managers outed my trans status to other employees at work and I’m thinking of reporting them.

Update: thank you everyone for your responses, don’t know if anyone will even see this update, I spoke to one of the managers and we’ve sorted things out, I went to the union and top manager at my office about the other manager and made it clear it’s not acceptable, and I don’t want to work under her anymore and make you aware of the situation, that was fine and he told me if anything else happens come back. So today I find out other members of staff are now gossiping about me, being rather derogatory, calling me an ‘it’, and speculating what I have or haven’t had done etc.

482,Asshole,"Hey all.

Some weeks ago I had to take my cat to a follow-up vet appointment to check on some pretty big scary surgery. 

Unfortunately my car wasn't working so I had to get a ride from an app similar to Uber. I'd done this before for an earlier vet appointment, so I thought it was no biggy. 

Firstly the driver was 15mins late, which was annoying but I acknowledge traffic is a factor beyond  control. When he finally shows up, he then refused to  let me in the car - because he's scared of animals. At this point the cat is in a solid plastic carrier with a towel over it, he can't see or be seen by the outside world.

At this point I'm going to be late for the appointment and get charged a cancellation fee (it's a specialist hospital, which was in the address so maybe should have been an indicator to the driver before accepting the ride). I tell the guy I'm really not impressed after trying to persuade him and he leaves. 

I manage to get a taxi last minute for a lot more money, but we get there with 2 mins to spare. I then call customer service to let them know about his refusal, and they say they'll feed it back.

18901,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway obviously, this is a pretty unique situation so I think my main account will get identified pretty fast otherwise. I'm 32/F/Florida.

So basically, I thought this was a pretty cut and dry situation, but apparently not, as I'm getting a lot of judgement (some bordering on abuse) from different people and my phone is blowing up. So I want to know if I was out of line.

So I'm 6 months pregnant, and I've been very open about what kind of way I want to give birth. I've discussed this with my group of girlfriends extensively, along with my family. I ideally want to have a natural, unassisted birth at home, which is near a hospital if things start to shape up as problematic. Now, for this process, I want support, and of course my husband is going to be there, but also I want my two sisters to be with me. 

This is where things get controversial. In my many conversations with friends and family, I mentioned I want my sisters there with me. I do not want my brother there, that would just be weird! But, in these conversations, my trans-sister-in-law was present, and she got the idea she would be included in this childbirth situation. Just for reference she transitioned around 3 years ago. I was unaware of this until last week, when she told me if there is anything in particular she should bring for the birth. I calmly mentioned that I am very selective over who I want in this very intimate situation, and told her than I hope she isn't offended if she isn't there for the birthing. 

This is when things blew up. She lost her temper and I got a torrent of emotional outbursts.  She said that she would never be able to give birth herself and excluding her is taking away from her womanhood and depriving her of her only chance of experiencing this expression of femininity. When she found out my two sisters were going to be there she told me that I was transphobic and she has as much of a right to be there as they do. 

After this, I received many emails, facebook messages, and text messages from several different people, calling me  transphobe and many other hurtful things. My trans-sister-in-law is very active in the transactivism community (which I fully support), and apparently she told them what had transpired. This has obviously rallied them to harass me, and now I'm starting to wonder if I messed up. 

I kind of wish I never mentioned anything about the birthing process to her, maybe I should have just kept all these plans to myself so she wouldn't feel excluded. I'm aware transpeople have a pretty shitty deal in life, and perhaps this added to their feelings of exclusion. But the other part of me says, it's my birthing, I'm going to very vulnerable and exposed, and I (perhaps selfishly) owe it to myself to make it as comfortable and safe for me as possible.

As I'm sitting, a girl sits next to me and I don't really pay to much attention her and and a friend texts me that they were at the bar already.

So I scan the bar and as I'm looking she happened to look at me and I notice her eyes were so beautiful. Like I'm talking about the color of her eyes, I've never seen a eyes like hers before.

I don't really know how to describe the color, but I thought they were pretty, so I said to her ""Wow! your eyes are beautiful!"" 

She immediately made a face and said ""Fuck off! Creep!"" and left, I was so confused at what happened, I didn't say it in a creepy way or anything and I was a little hurt.

He is 27 years old and was living with his aunt before us and he was really depressed living with her (or at least that is what my husband told me.) We wanted him to get back on his feet so when he asked to live with us it seemed like it wouldn't be a problem because the 3 of us had already lived together in the past before my husband and I got married.

But I thought he was only going to live with us a few month so after a year I asked him to start looking for a new place in like march of this year, and gave him three months to move out. 

In that three month he went behind my back and asked my husband if he could stay longer and my husband said yes and didnt tell me. So 3 months goes by and I'm like WTF? So I give him an extension by another month, and HE DOES THE SAME THING AGAIN. Talks to my husband behind my back and is like ""hey it would be so great if we could wait until the end of the year because I'm trying to buy a house"" (mind you he hasn't even talked to a lender at this point and I think he is moving out in 2 weeks.
So I find out that my husband told him that was ok AGAIN and I'm pissed so I'm like no. And give him one more extension because 2 weeks isnt enough to move after my husband made him think he could stay.
So I have given this man like 3/4 extensions and started asking him to move out 6 months ago and this man is still in my house on the 2nd of the next month. So I flipped out and threatened to charge him a hundred bucks for every day that he is still in my house so he moved out imediately. But now he is acting like I'm a an asshole cause I made him get all of his shit out on the 2nd?

2 months pass and the same couple comes back, sits in my section. Before I went to greet them, another server warned me that they never tip, so don’t even bother giving them good service. I called their bluff and still gave them the best service I could, I’m talking giving them refills, to-go cups, asking them if they wanted dessert, all of that. They didn’t tip. This happens 4-5 more times. They started coming in twice a week and everyone refused to take them, so I get stuck with them. It got to the point where all I did was give them silverware and drinks. I stopped checking in on them all together, and even when I see their cups are empty and they need refills I just ignore it.

4600,Asshole,"My boyfriend has had trouble with his skin for a long time. In particular, shaving leaves his skin severely irritated. When I met him, he had a very rough beard, which he said he kept to avoid shaving. About a year ago he started a white-collar job which meant he had to shave it off. Since then shaving has been a pretty bad experience for him. Every morning he goes to work with a very bad red neck and face. He started to shave in the shower at my direction and that helps a little, but it’s still pretty bad. 

A few months ago, his birthday was coming up. I am really bad at buying presents, and was pumped when I thought I had figured out the perfect present. I had done some research and bought him exfoliate, a razor for sensitive skin and some other shaving-relating products to round it all out. I was excited to finally be proud of a present I got for him.

His birthday was last week, and it turns out exfoliating and this new razor doesn’t entirely fix his issues, but helps immensely. He was absolutely ecstatic and said it was the best present he had ever received, and he felt he could finally move past the discomfort and embarrassment of having inflamed skin every day.

While he was thanking me, I told him that I had been holding onto that present for three months and had been dying to give it to him the whole time, and that at times I had almost broken and given it to him early. Upon hearing I had it for months, he suddenly turned.

He has been furious with me the last week and we just can’t agree on who is at fault here – our friends/family are equally split so I’m interested to hear Reddit’s take. 

His perspective is that I have been allowing him to suffer for my own benefit. He seems particularly mad about that fact that every morning he complains about his skin and for three months I’ve had the “option to fix it” and decided not to so I could maximise my own gratification. He thinks it’s the equivalent of if I had, for example, terrible back pains and he stumbled on a pill that would fix it, bought it and then decided to wait three months to give it to me while watching me suffer every day.

I think that’s a pretty big exaggeration. I do see where he is coming from, but I feel like he is being very ungrateful for a well thought out present. I just wanted to bring him happiness on his birthday and didn’t feel like it was so serious that waiting was immoral. He is so difficult to buy presents for, and I had finally figured something out and if I gave it to him early I’d be left at square one and faced with the likelihood of disappointing him.

16638,Everyone Sucks,"Hello, I (31F) have been married to my husband (28M) for roughly two years, we dated for 1 year before that. In my past life before working at the church, I was a bartender at a popular bar. I made enough money to pay off my car and some credit card debt that never seemed to go away. Unfortunately, I had some issues with addiction and was not living a healthy lifestyle at the time. I had a couple of serious boyfriends and a dozen ONS before meeting my now husband.

I disclosed that I had a rough time through my early to mid-twenties before we got married and was willing to be honest with him whenever he asked about anything. My husband is an old-fashioned type and follows the adage of “a gentleman never asks, and a lady never tells”. This was fine for me because I wanted to leave the past in the past and he wasn’t a jealous type while we were dating.

However, I have a few tattoos from the days when I was in one of my serious relationships before my current husband. He never asked about these ones, so I didn’t feel like it was something that needed to be discussed. Whenever my now husband *generally* asked about my tattoos (I have a lot of them) I told him simply I liked the art, which is true. I knew when saying this in the back of my head that some of them had baggage and did not want to dig that up. At the time, I know he would have understood.

The conversation of tattoos did not come up again until a year into marriage. Because of talking about the loose associations some of them had, jealousy issues started finding their way into our relationship. Let’s say one of them had to do with my ex’s metaphysical snake. I love him dearly, I do. I want to spend the rest of my life with him, but these jealousy issues are starting to get cumbersome. It seems like every time he talks about this, he is possessed and wants to know all the dirty little details of this particular person in relation to himself.

I feel like he is views me like I am trash, even though he is using a calm, respectful tone. I feel like when he goes deep into the rabbit hole about this, the only way to help him is to talk about the details that he is asking about. Every time it is like putting the nail in one coffin but opening up ten new cans of worms. After growing tired, I told him that I do not want to talk about it anymore. Seemingly out of anger, he told me that he wants the tattoo removed or covered up.

I feel like he had his opportunity to find out about the details of all my tattoos and get them removed before the wedding. I could have been more open and forthcoming about the intimate nature of some of these tattoos, but we were seemingly operating under the don’t ask don’t tell philosophy. But now, there are early memories and wedding pictures tainted. I am hurt by him requesting me to remove the tattoos because it makes me feel objectified. It *seems* that this is leading to an ultimatum and I have decided not to remove it. Am I an asshole for not removing the tattoo?

I thanked her and said something about how I couldn't wait to co parent with the two of them. Turns out that she didn't know that I was pregnant (5 months at the time) with his child the whole time.

But one big quirk is that she goes to her mom's house religiously on Sunday's like a born again Christian going to church, except she is there all day. Like she wakes up, heads out, and stays all day until it's time to sleep.

I go with her most times just to spend time together but it's honestly exhausting for me. I don't care for her mom. She's alright to me, she is just not a good person to other people. Very self serving and I can't respect her for it. Let alone do I want to spend a whole day out of every one of my weeks with her.

I've vocalized that I would rather us stay home or just do something together. But she's very defensive over spending the day with her mom. Fine...but I work nights and she works days, and we have different days off... So I like to spend Sunday days with her so that we can help make the marriage work. So I just go 90% of the time.

Now, the 10% of the time that I don't go, I always get something in return from the mom. Like a ""oh he must not love me or something!"" Kind of act.

That comment made her tip over, so she chucked the bag on top of where I put it at first. Keep in mind the bag had a switch, laptop, DS, and phone inside of it. At that point I snapped as well and yelled “MOM you can’t just throw my computer around like you own it” she whispered “Get in the f**king car, you may not have a chance to play that computer.” Her reasoning was because I yelled outside in our neighborhood.

Tonight I was a Suspicious Sally and checked my husband's text messages from his smart watch. I see a series of messages to an unsaved number and while they're not explicit they essentially allude to wanting to meet up again. The weird thing is that it only displayed one side of the conversation, the responses from my husband's phone. 

I confronted him and he insisted that he didn't know what I was talking about. I get his watch and show him. He shows me his phone and says they aren't in there so he's not sure why they're on his watch. 

I pulled up our text history from our phone carrier and it very clearly shows sent and received messages from that number today. I searched the past 90 days (as far back as it goes) and there weren't any other matches (just today). 

Then I Googled the number and it shows that it belongs to an escort. He says that proves that he's innocent because how could he get away with paying for it? And as for an affair,  when would he have time. I manage the money and watch it like a hawk so I definitely would notice it. But he could certainly have credit that I'm not aware of. 

He hasn't been defensive,  just confused and agrees that it's fucked up and he'd be pissed if reversed. 

So Reddit, AITA for not believing him/being suspicious?

Edit 1: people are asking why I snooped...
He's had emotional affairs on a couple of occasions during our 12 year relationship. This hasn't happened in over 4 years as far as I know. In the past, he hasn't denied when I've discovered it and just said he wasn't getting attention from me so he got it elsewhere and it wasn't serious. It's always been just sharing too much/ confiding in girl friends, not sexual from what I could tell. 

What makes me pause is that the messages were one sided (why only delete half of a conversation?) and one mentions meeting again but I can't find any other record in the past 90 days.

Edit 2: I texted the number. No response yet.

Edit 3: He finally copped to it. Thank you to everyone for your advice and for making me feel less crazy.

11776,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account. 

A coworker recently asked me to switch contracts at our job. Her contract is 11 months and mine is 11.5m. There is quite a pay difference between our contracts (at base level, difference is $3k but increases depending on years of experience). Obviously she has quite a few years of experience under her belt (I believe 10-15ish years) whereas I only have 1 since I just started out of college last year. 

She emailed me asking if we can switch contracts, without an explanation of course. 

I responded back (I’m summarizing, obviously responded in a polite way) that I’m not interested in switching because I enjoy being busy with my contract (11.5 months means I’m busy throughout the year basically - minus 2 weeks). 

She then proceeded to call me basically begging to take my contract since she’s retiring soon (4ish years) and that the 11.5m salary (plus her years of experience) will make a huge change in her retirement fund. 

I honestly didn’t want to budge because at that point I felt like she was trying to guilt trip me by saying she needs more money for retirement. So I stuck to my guns and said no because the 11.5m salary allows for me to live comfortably - pay my bills and still have leftover for savings/misc. expenses. 

So AITA for saying no to someone who just wants more money for retirement? The more I think about it...

The choice was between me and one of my newer coworkers. The job eventually went to the other person. Of course, I really wanted this promotion, but I totally understand why they went for the other person and they are doing a good job.

Shortly after the announcement of the new assistent supervisor, I was left alone with two entirely new coworkers for a whole day and I was expected to show them everything and teach them how to do their jobs. No supervisors, just me being the only experienced employee for the whole day with two new guys. After our shift ended, the two supervisors (meaning my boss and the assistent supervisor) both showed up for an extra shift to film a promotion video. This annoyed me. A lot.

So I went and told my boss that now that there is an assistant supervisor, I did not feel comfortable being at work for the whole day with two new guys. Especially since both supervisors were available that evening. In my opion, one of them should have taken the day shift to supervise and help the new guys get set up, and not me. I feel like it's their job as supervisors to do so. I also told him that for this one time it was fine, but I don't want something like that to happen again.

Now, my boss said to the assistent supervisor that he thinks I'm being difficult about this, and he thinks it's due to me not getting that promotion. So am I being an asshole about this?

He comes inside and even when he brushes his teeth I can still smell it coming from his lungs and I can't help myself, I start coughing.

I understand it's a habitual addiction mixed with a physical addiction. He tried going on stop smoking aids but it doesn't stop the pot smoking.

But after the break up we continued an off and on again friends with benefits relationship until I turned 23. Which was also the same time I found out I was pregnant...

He was going to school to be a doctor and he was in his second year of getting his doctorates when I found out. He also was studying in another state that was on the other side of the country. I got pregnant during one of his visits back home. 

When I found out I was pregnant I told him immediately. He was very very angry and asked what I was going to do about it. I told him I’d be keeping it and he told me he wanted no part in the child’s life because it was going to ruin everything for him. I told him that wasn’t an option. 

I myself grew up with my birth father jumping in and out of the picture and it’s a big stem of my mental illnesses now. All things he knew.

After begging him to be in the baby’s life throughout almost my entire pregnancy one day he and his parents called me and offered me a deal. They offered to pay me a very hefty child support until the day the child turned 18 if I never forced him to be a real father. His parents (who are very wealthy) promised to take care of everything.

At first I said no. I refused and called them all assholes and told them my baby was gonna have a dad... but after talking to many of my friends and family they thought it best I take the offer. They told me there was no use in forcing him to be a shitty dad to my baby. I finally agreed about 8 months into my pregnancy.

I took sole custody of course. It’s been 7 years and I had a beautiful baby girl that I love more than anything on earth. Every single month I get a check and not once has it ever been late. I haven’t seen or talked to my ex since the day he handed me the first check. Until about a week ago. 

I get a call and it’s my ex. He tells me he wants to take joint custody of our daughter. The daughter he has never met in his or her life ever! I was infuriated and told him no. He told me that I can’t just say no because he’s gonna take me to court where a judge will decide. 

I was crying and screaming and asking why he was doing this. He told me he was sorry but he’s ready to be a father and he wants to be there for our daughter. When I told him I was going to fight him with every fiber of my being to make sure he got nothing he told me I was being ridiculous and I need to grow up. 

I’ve told my family and friends and almost all of them have told me I need to give him a chance and that I’m just being a bitch. The only person that agrees with me is my mother who watched me get torn apart by my fathers constant jumping in and out of my life when I was a child.

I don't feel like I'm being selfish I feel like this girl is in a bad situation and really doesn't have many options.  She isn't able to stay with her parents because they recently took custody of her younger cousins so there isn't any room.  She has a grandma who lives about 50 miles away so not ideal but an option.  If I let this happen it will cause tension between my husband and I but I cant imagine being in this girls situation.

AITA if I let her stay?

&#x200B;

EDIT: A little more info.  Girlfriend does have a stable job.  She was paying very little in rent and I have looked at some rooms to rent in the area but even a room is $400+.  My husband doesn't want her to stay because he feels like if they are old enough to play house they are old enough to be in their own place.  He is a very good man and I don't want to cause problems in our relationship over this.

EDIT 2: Now I do feel like an asshole. I was telling my husband that I have talked to a couple of people I know about her renting a room from them. They haven’t meet her so they weren’t comfortable with it. I was disappointed but understood. He said I love you and you should do what you think you need to do.  I told him I knew he didn’t really like the idea but he said if this is what you think is best I’ll be ok. He had some super basic no tolerance rules like both of them working full time and cleaning up after themselves. We’re also moving them to the empty room in the basement so everyone has space.

15951,Not the A-hole,"I am relatively new to the subreddit and decided I should participate more than just by casting judgement on others. I guess it is my turn to be judged.

This happened some time ago.

My grandfather and I were super close. Essentially he played the role of my father. We were best friends.

He worked as an operator at a steel refinery. He was one of the guys that controlled the huge machines that put the billets on the rollers etc. It was a physically toxic environment which resulted in emphysema as well as lung cancer.

Near the end of his life, he suffered a heart attack which landed him in hospital. The family rallied around him, and we would take turns visiting him, taking care of him, taking his favorite snacks / magazines etc. We all spent a lot of time in the hospital with him just to make sure he wasn't lonely.

At this time, I was in training for a new job and was in the final evaluation phase. During the last week, we were called to the hospital by the doctors on three different occasions to ""say goodbye"" - the doctors were convinced he wouldn't make it through the night each time. Granted, his organs were shutting down one by one and was basically only alive because he was hooked up to a dialysis machine. 

Keep in mind, each time we got the call from the doctors, we all took our turns saying good bye. He was no longer conscious at this point. We were all shattered, basically having our final words with him each time. Each time we got the call, we dropped everything so that we could go through to see him.

On the day that he died, we got another call from the hospital saying that we should come say good bye to him. This time, I refused to go. I had already said my good-byes and was way too emotionally raw to have to go through it again. Part of me felt that we would just get the same call the next day, and the next after that. I think I was in denial that he was actually dying, telling myself that he will pull through it. Needless to say, he passed away that same day, and since then I have carried a lot of guilt with me for not going the last time. 

AITA for not going one final time?

18916,Not the A-hole,"My two year old son is at an age where everyone wants to touch him and pinch him. 

My wife and I agreed we wouldn’t force our kids to hug or kiss anyone because we want to teach appropriate physical boundaries and ownership of your body from an early age. 

Recently my grandmother visited and when she was leaving my sister directed my son to “give Grammy a kiss goodbye” and he said “don’t want to” and we said “that’s fine, wave goodbye then.” And he waved and said goodbye. 

She started to say “oh, no kiss for Grammy?” But I shut that down with “(son) has a lot of ways to express his feelings” and we left it at that. She seemed to understand. 

My sister took her to the airport but when she was over later she said I was an asshole for not having my son kiss his great grandmother goodbye knowing it meant something to her just because he “didn’t want to”. 

I tried to explain not wanting physical touching isn’t the same as not wanting to leave the park or whatever, but she said it’s not as big a deal to him to give her a quick kiss as it was for her to feel her great grandson didn’t treasure her visit. 

We’re about to host thanksgiving and there will be plenty of family expecting hugs and kisses and physical affection from our son, and in a couple years, from our daughter as well.

12056,Asshole," I am fairly new to Reddit, so sorry in advance if this doesnt fit the theme. 

I just had a big argument with my bf and really can't see if I'm over-reacting or I am in the right. My bf and I have been together for about a year. We're both students, and both live at our parents. My family is very well-off, and I receive a monthly allowance that I use to pay my uni fees, transport, food when I don't eat at home, taxes, etc. I used to do a little bit of shopping / save up for vacations with what was left of it. He, on the other hand, is not as wealthy. His mom pays for his school, has no money from the dad, and also has siblings. They aren't poor, but aren't rich either. 

Since we got together, we made a habit of eating out together a few times a month (nothing crazy expensive). I've been paying almost everytime, because of his situation, and because or that stopped shopping or treating myself with my leftover allowance. Since has been looking for a job for ages, I asked my dad to give him a hand, and he got employed at one of my dad's friends businesses. The other day, he showed me, all proud, the beginning of his Marvel DVD collection (about 80 bucks worth), and I got very angry. The last months, he discovered Magic The Gathering and spent about 200 bucks on packs, and the DVDs really were the last straw for me. 

I told him he wasnt respectful of me for spending so recklessly the money I made it possible for him to earn in the first place, that he should be saving that up. That I was pissed he didnt say anything treating me for dinner for once, instead of buying all this crap. He got mad and said he never said anything about me going shopping, or my huge manga collection, and that the money wan't mine to begin with, and also told me that me buying him dinner wasn't an obligation of mine. I told him he was delusionnal about his finances: I could afford that, he couldn't. 

I do understand that those things are important to him, but I think he really needs ro rethink his priorities about the way he spents his money, especially with his school fees....

4547,Asshole,"Longtime lurker-- I finally have a moral dilemma to post about! Let's see what you all have to say.

&#x200B;

My boyfriend and I were home today and got a notification from our Ring camera that there was motion at the front door. We were both in the middle of working/studying so we didn't immediately check the video. A minute or so after the alert, my boyfriend checks his phone and says ""Oh my god!"" and starts laughing hysterically. Apparently a kid (10ish years old) was going around the neighborhood with what looked like his dad and younger sister, giving out newsletter-style newspapers for a church in the area that also runs a private school. The newspaper has little articles about their parish but is mostly a big advertisement for their upcoming autumn festival. The kid puts the newspaper in our box and starts making faces at the camera-- silly things like wrinkling his nose and sticking out his tongue. Then he looks cautiously back at his dad, who had continued on to the next house and is now off-camera, and puts his closed fist up near the camera and slowly flips it off. After that the kid continued on his way.

I sent the video to my family just for laughs and my brother and dad both said that we should tweet the video to the school's Twitter account and teach the kid a lesson. I'm conflicted about this; it would be satisfying to know that the kid would probably get in trouble for it, but I don't know if it really warrants a public call-out. It was pretty funny but definitely rude, and I can't help but think that he should know not to do something like that when acting as a sort of representative of this church/school. At the same time, it wasn't a big deal.

15702,Asshole,"Earlier this week I found out I am pregnant.  After the second test showed positive I called my mom and told her.  After that I called my sister and told her as well.  I wasn’t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  

I’ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it’s my choice and I don’t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  

Edit. Just to clarify a couple things cause I keep getting basically the same response in my inbox.  My mother and sister had no more choice in the matter than he did.   I went to them for support and advice as they have both been there, but it was my choice.  

I didn’t tell him first because due to our age and length of the relationship I honestly thought he’d want me to terminate the pregnancy and I wanted few day to wrap my head around the situation before taking that on.  Turns out that wasn’t the case though.

21737,Not the A-hole,"So here is the situation.

Me: nurse. Working 50ish hours a week in paediatric ICU. Cry at least once a week because that shit is hard. My salary pays our bills. All of them. 

Husband: 25M. Has a degree but isn't looking for a job. Works 2 days a week at the grocery store. Spends most of his time playing LoL. 

Btw all events here are in accordance with Covid Legislation. 

Today was supposed to be A Good Day. I had been begging my husband to swap his Saturday shift to literally anything else so that we could have days off together. We haven't had a weekend together since our wedding, 18mo ago. 

Today was supposed to be our first Saturday off together. We were going to go to an animal sanctuary.


He starts the day by going to breakfast. With his best mate. Leaving before I even wake up. I wake up around 9 and realise he is not home. Call. He says he's helping his mate set up some lights and that the weather is too rainy for the animal sanctuary anyway. 

He gets home at 1ish. Lies around. Plays some video games, promising we would cook dinner together tonight.

Leaves again at 5 to help the same mate with something else. 

I go grocery shopping. I don't drive because of medical issues, but I walk there and back in the rain. I get home, realise I've left my keys inside. Call husband, knowing he's 5min away. He says he will leave in a minute. I sit in the rain and the cold (southern hemisphere). 45 min later, I call again. He hasn't left yet. He finally agrees to come and let me in the house, so he drives up, presses the clicker to let me in the garage and leaves again. 

At 10, I I called to see where he is. His friend answers. Says he is driving out to do something an hour away. 

It's 10.30. I am going to bed. I have sent him a txt that I am upset and don't want to speak to him tonight and would rather he left me alone. 

As far as I am concerned, if he can't value me more than his best mate on the first day off he and I have shared in a year and a half, he can go sleep in his bed instead. (Btw, his friend doesn't work, so they hang out all the time when I am at work). 

He is going to be upset. And he is gonna tell his mate and his mate is going to tell him I'm being a bitch.

Adding some info: I am 26. We weren't always like this. I don't know what changed. I'm fairly confident he's not having an affair. And I fully intend on talking this through, but at a time that isn't 4am.

We arrived with our laundry but she was using the washing machine was in use. We waited, but then I realized I can't wait around because I had work. I told my BF to just chuck the clothes in (mostly my underwear and 1 dress) when the washer was done. So I leave and come back to ask my BF where my clothes are. He said that he only did one load before he needed to leave so he just left the clothes there for next time. Ok cool. We went there 2 days later and ask his mom where my stuff is. She doesn't know. I look everywhere and think hmmm that is weird I really need to wash my underwear. 2 more days pass and I ask her again where are my clothes? She said that she ""thinks"" she threw them away while cleaning her house. She said she didn't know who they belonged to so she just threw them away and she is very sorry.

WELL I was really upset about this. First of all this felt really personal. None of my BF's clothes were missing plus she lives with her two teenage daughters who have very similar Victoria Secret underwear to mine and none of there stuff was missing either. Of course they are just clothes, I can always get new stuff but for me it is about the principle. I told my BF that I need her to pay me back for what she threw away. At least $100 since she also threw away a dress of mine. He thinks I'm being an asshole for no reason. He said ""YoU HaVe PleNTy Of mOnEY JuST BuY NeW OnEs"" and also ""IT WaS aN AcCiDenT"" Again It is about the principle. If I ""accidentally"" threw away her stuff I would be expected to pay for its replacement and I would do it because I'm not a shitty human. I've asked his mom for the money and she said she will pay me ""soon"" whatever that means. I'm sure she will, but now the whole family, including my BF act like they have some problem with me.

5170,Everyone Sucks,"So my name is Evelyn (female), pronounced Ev-uh-lyn. I have a coworker, John, who is from England. He's been pronouncing my name in the way I assume is the English way, ""Eve. Lin."" The first couple times I forgave him for it because I assumed it was just cross-ocean confusion. Sort of like how Americans and Brits spell certain words differently, color/colour, etc.

But now it's been a year and a half of me telling him the proper pronunciation and he persists in calling me by the wrong pronunciation. I've gone to management, to HR, we've had meetings, I've spoken to him, he refuses to call me by my correct name. I know it's not a huge issue but it's not my name. That would be like calling someone named Jerry ""Garry"" simply because J and G can make the same sound.

His name is John. Plain old John. A lovely name. My son's name. However, I know Jack is an acceptable nickname for John. So I've started calling him Jack. Apparently he hates the name Jack. He let it slide twice before he came to me and spoke to me and requested I call him John and only John. I gave him the same response he gives me ""of course, my apologizes, will make right in future."" I thought maybe he'd take a hint but he keeps calling me the wrong pronunciation.

So I continued calling him Jack. He took me to HR with the issue where HR promptly ignored my previous complaint, despite my paper trail of emails to the contrary. Eventually they capitulated that I had raised the issue first but I still got a write-up for creating a toxic and unfriendly work atmosphere.

Now I'm just not speaking to John unless necessary and I refuse to use a name when talking to him at all. And when we email or text I've been signing my emails with ""regards"" which I've read is considered a stern and rude way to end correspondence to the English.

Despite the fact that it made my coworkers laugh they all agreed that while John is a bigger asshole, I'm also an asshole for adding to the issue.

I'm curious, was I right or was an ass?

This summer they basically cut all that off once I got back home.

The line extends around a large round stove  where there is a large round counter top that surrounds the cooks and stove where you are supposed to put your bowl of raw ingredients.

There were like 3 people at the end of this circle countertop and then a massive gap of space where two old ladies at the beginning of the line, standing there, waiting for their food to be taken. As a result, my gf and I who were standing directly behind them, along with 6 others behind us, had to hold their bowls overflowing with raw chicken and sauce in their hands. I didn’t want to bother them or cause a scene by giving them orders, so I just decided to go up to the counter and put my bowl down. One of the cooks immediately took my bowl and started cooking it. The old ladies yelled out, “aren’t we next!?” The cook went and took their bowls and once they moved down the line, everyone moved all the way down and put their bowls down on the counter (which the old ladies were stopping all of them from doing).

In my opinion everyone who was on line should have followed behind me, because why were those two ladies just standing at the beginning of the line? Like, move up...

OR the chef could have just ignored me and taken the old ladies bowls first. I wouldn’t have been mad. I just wanted to put my bowl down. 

As I write this, other people on the line have moved all the way down to the end of the line with everyone able to rest their bowl on the counter. This is how it should be.

Edit: Low key...I’m thinking, a lot of the time the chefs will ask patrons to move down. When I went to the end of the line she grabbed my bowl really quickly (and gf). Almost as a thank you for doing the right thing.

Also want to make clear my personal intention was just to put the bowl down, especially with my gf nagging my ear about them not moving. The cooks could have taken the old ladies food before mine if they wanted to, except they didn’t, I wonder why.

8725,Asshole,"Okay so this is a bit of a long one, but I'm willing to accept my fate. 


Some backstory: boyfriend (28m) and I (28f) and our 2 year old daughter live with my boyfriend's parents. They do A TON for us, and I'm immensely grateful for it, but on the flip side they don't respect my boyfriend as an adult or father and it's a big source of contention for our relationship when he doesn't stand up for himself. 


Yesterday we were meant to go to a birthday party that started at 1, about an hour and a half from our house. Already knew we were going to be late because I didn't get off work until 12, but I was hoping not to be immensely late. Boyfriend and baby were both home ALL DAY (this is important later). When I got home boyfriend and his dad were outside messing around with his pull behind trailer. I went inside, got all of our stuff together, and we were walking out of the house when my boyfriend's father asks for his help again, changing a tire on the pull behind trailer. Boyfriend tells him we really need to leave now as we're already late, but he says he *doesn't care* and to help, it'll only take five minutes.


Now if the situation were reversed, I would've told my dad ""I'm sorry Dad, I would be happy to help you but unfortunately we need to leave. If you had discussed this earlier with me I could've made it work but unfortunately I can't""


Is that what my boyfriend did? No. He went out to change the tire. I told him that I was going to finish getting everything together (baby still needed her shoes on) but that if he wasn't done I was leaving without him because at this point the party had started an hour ago and we still had to travel another hour and a half to make it there. Went out about 5 minutes later and they hadn't even gotten the bad tire off yet. I waited another ten minutes, and then said okay we really need to leave. Boyfriend just continued to change the tire, so I left.


I know this seems petty and stupid, but I felt (and still feel) incredibly disrespected by his dad, and by my boyfriend who I feel should've stuck up for me/us/our plans. Especially because then his father LEFT THE TRAILER PARKED, AND IT'S STILL SITTING THERE RIGHT THIS SECOND. My boyfriend could've changed the tire at literally any other point when we got back, or even this morning (all this happened yesterday). And this is unfortunately not the first time in our 5 year relationship that he's been forced to choose between our plans or stuff his parents spring on him last second. He always chooses his parents even if it leaves me in the lurch or alone.


As a note, I did end up coming back to get my boyfriend (half an hour later when he was done), and he came to the party, but it caused a huge rift between us and he thinks I shouldn't have left without him, because how is he supposed to say no to his parents? (His words)


AITA?

19854,Not the A-hole,"TLDR at the end

I (29m) in a 4.5 years relationship with girlfriend (29f). 

When we started to date, I used to smoke weed a couple of times a month. To be honest, it wasn't my favorite drug but I felt like smoking sometimes. 

After 9 days we started the relationship, was my birthday and I smoked with a couple of friends and  she was there but haven't seen it because she was engaged in a conversation. 

We arrived at home and I asked her if she was ok with that. She started crying a lot, yelled, told about her lazy stoner ex boyfriend and how it gives money to drug dealers and had a disproportional response IMO. 
Since we were in the very first days and I usually avoid conflicts and weed wasn't that important, I said I wouldn't smoke anymore.

4 years later, I'm living alone, we are struggling a lot with dead bedroom in the last year and we both thought about breaking up a few times. 
In one of those brutally honest talks, I said I wanted to try weed again. She said ""ok"". 

Few weeks after this conversation, I bought from a guy that offers premium stuff, like from small growers to avoid giving money to drug cartels. 

Smoked around 5 times in 2-3, it was nice, my sleep improved and I'm less procrastinating in most of stuff.

In this whole time I felt bad because I was hiding it from her and was waiting for the right timing to tell her. But I lost that trying to find the perfect timing. 


Yesterday I spontaneously told her that I was doing for the last couple weeks and now she's pissed because I took that much of time to tell her and said ""I'm surprised how could you look in my eyes these weeks when hiding it from me! I didn't knew you could lie to me like that"". 

And the mess is done. 

Honestly, I don't feel like a liar because it was never my intention to hide it from her. I was just trying to find an appropriate moment for that and even my therapist advised me to wait until we solved the other miscommunication issues. 

Was I the asshole to tell her that late?

Let’s take it back six years to 2013. It’s the day of my college graduation. Since the ceremony begins fairly early, my eight fraternity brothers (I know) and I decide to get up even earlier to get properly tanked. After a couple hours of drinking, we get together to pose for group photos in our grad caps. 

During the last photo, I decided to it would be hilarious to surreptitiously hang my flaccid wang over the waistband of my shorts--the idea being that no one would notice my exposed Johnson until after the picture came out and we’d all have a laugh. It worked, and we did (though one of my friends was annoyed that I ruined the photo.) 

I didn’t think much of it until later that morning when I realize one of my friends has posted the photo on Instagram! Naturally, I freaked out and made him delete it immediately—but at this point had already been up for an hour or two and garnered it’s fair of likes and “haha omg” comments. Needless to say, I was pretty fucking pissed at the time and to be honest, it still irks me a bit to this day. But when I confronted him about it, he basically said if you didn’t want this on social media you shouldn’t have done it.  

So look, I know how incredibly immature this was to do in the first place. And I know, that real lesson here is to keep your dong in your pants at all times. That said, this was a photo was taken in the company of solely my closest male friends—not intended to be shared with the world. So did I have this coming? Or was my friend being a major dick?

22004,Not the A-hole,"I (18f) am the manager at a pool, I have been the manager for 3 years (all the managers in this pool company are high school/college kids), everybody in the community knows and likes me. 

There is a lady named M and her son K; I’ve known them for two years. K is nonverbal and he has autism. This means oftentimes when we tell him not to run and to exit the pool for safety break that he does not listen. That is okay with us! There are a lot of disabled children who come to our pool and we do our best to accommodate them, and his mother had been very cooperative with us until this year. 

This year, she started allowing allowing K to swim in the deep end unsupervised. She sits on the opposite side of the pool, not in the water at all, and her son is not in arms reach. At first I thought that maybe she could not swim but it turns out she doesn’t want to get her hair wet 😐. K is 4 years old  and a very small boy, and the deep end is 4 ft deep, which is just deep enough for a small child to struggle. 

When my pool opened this year, in the first week alone I had to jump in the water to save him twice because his mother was not watching him and he began to struggle. His mother insists that he is able to swim bc he is able to stay afloat on his own. While this is true, he does not have the endurance to stay afloat for long periods of time. When he gets tired he often grabs random strangers or things to stay afloat and rest- this indicates to me and my lifeguards that he should not be swimming alone, because both times that he drowned were times in which he got tired and did not have anything or anybody to grab onto. After both times that i rescued her son I spoke to M to discuss that she needed to supervise K to prevent this from happening again and she insisted that he can swim by himself. Obviously he can’t, as I have had to save him twice. 
I told my supervisor about this and the next time he visited my pool while M and K were swimming he told her she had to have her son within arms reach or that she had to leave. She neither left nor supervised her son so he called the cops on her. 

The cops escorted M out and all the residents and M made a huge stink about it on Facebook, they are saying that we are ableist and racist (M and K are black). First of all I don’t think I am ableist bc I have never had this kind of problem with any other parents at the pool, whether their child is or isn’t disabled they will watch their kids if they can’t swim because that is common sense. Second of all, I don’t know what is so “racist” or “ableist” about wanting M to watch her son so that he stops drowning. It is so horrifying to watch a child swim knowing that if u take your eyes off of him that he might start to drown. 

AITA? I wanted to prevent her son from drowning again but not the neighborhood Facebook moms are mad about this and complaining to HOA.

Edit bc I’m getting a lot of questions about this: when you ask a patron to leave the pool and they say no then they are formally considered trespassing. We told M this and that if she stayed the cops would be called. She still did not leave so we called the cops to escort her off the premises. There was not really much else we could do bc we can’t physically force her off the premises, and letting her just stay instead of making her leave enables her negligent behavior.",440,3852,0.96,AITA?

17037,Not the A-hole,"Here are the basics.  My mother is disabled with a host of medical issues.  She is 66 yrs old and does not have any sort of dementia. She does have some memory issues though. A year ago, her license was suspended after she reported to her doctor that she had fallen asleep in her car.  She drove to a store, parked, and fell asleep slumped over the wheel for several hours.  Passerbys knocked on her window to check on her and she responded but went back to sleep.  She did this over three hours.  

Once she lost her license, I set her up with GoGo Grandparent that uses Lyft and Uber to shuttle her around at a moments notice with just a call.  No confusing apps, no 24 hour notice. There is no cost to her since I pay for it.  I get texts when she is picked up and dropped off and it helps me keep track of when she actually goes to her appointments. Sometimes she gets her dates confused.  Complicating this is that she had just purchased a car just days before the incident and she desperately wants to drive again because she wants to drive her new car. To help with this aspect, I use her car on some weekends so she can at least be in her new car while running her errands. 

Another issue is that three months ago she was hospitalized and since then she is on 24/7 oxygen and she feels trapped in her apartment because she has to use an oxygen concentrator which has limited battery time. This has only exacerbated her desire to drive her own vehicle.

She has been pretty good about not driving up until a month ago. But a month ago she decided to start paying a friend to drive her and she found a second friend who is an Uber driver who takes her to appointments, or so she says.  My concern here is that she is telling me she is getting a ride when in fact she is driving herself. The change that happened a month ago is that we figured out what caused her sleepiness and adjusted the medication to address that issue and added new medication to address the hallucinations she admitted having ""for years"". She now feels there should be no barrier to getting her license back but I don't think the doctors will sign off on it. It has become an obsession.

So my question is, would I be an asshole if I hire a private investigator to see if she is being honest about not driving?  Since she isn't using the service, I have no way of knowing if she is driving or not.  I trusted her before and I don't technically have any evidence that these people are not driving her.  But she has the psychology of a rebellious 13 year and doesn't like being told what to do. I had some assurance with the car service.  Now my gut tells me there may be cause to worry.

20884,No A-holes here,"I think my family and her friends are going to be seen as asshole for this but here I go.

My sister was killed in a traffic accident on Sunday night.  A drunk driver t-boned her car at an intersection and she died at the scene.  We're still trying to process what happened, it happened so suddently.  

The worst part is what happened leading up to the accident.  My sister was dating this really thoughtless moron, Brett.  While he treated my sister great in the begining, their relationship rotted to the point where she was doing everything while he sat on the couch playing video games or watching TV all day long.  My sister always resented his behavior and how she never got to do any of the thing couples do.  He and some of their more assholish friends would always beg for her to just give him a chance.  Everytime she tried to leave him, she would always be guilted into staying with him because of some mental health issues or how he'll make it up to her.  

He really fucked up this time.  It was her birthday on Sunday and she told us that she wanted to go out for dinner (we live in an area where you can dine outside) and take a walk out by the waterfront.  Brett tells her they are going out... only for him to stop by his buddy's place.  Apparently there was some guy Brett hadn't seen in a long time and they wanted to hang out (later found this out from someone who was there) for the night.  According to the guys who were there, Brett admitted that he forgot to make dinner reservations and by the time he got around to it, everywhere was booked.  That was when my sister left.

No one in our family wants Brett to be there.  As far as we are concerned, he is just as responsible for her death as the drunk driver.  If he had just done the one damn thing she wanted to do for her birthday, I would still have a sister and I wouldn't be typing this.

Opinion is divided.  Half think that my family has the right to ban Brett while the other half (family friends, people at my parents church, some neighbors) think that we are being too harsh and that we should allow him to come since he is in mourning too.  

I personally don't want Brett there is because the funeral home our parents chose will only allow a limited number of guests in attendance and I'd rather a spot go to someone who actually cared about her in life instead of someone who didn't.

So honestly I thought I was NTA but quite literally my whole family have been messaging me really hurtful things.

My cousin 18m is staying with me 23f for a couple weeks so he can see a friend that lives nearby to me ( my country has dealt really well with COVID so it’s allowed ) this was fine with me cuz we’ve always got on well 

Now I have a few medical conditions that I take medication for: I have bad allergies that cause my nose to swell up until I can’t breathe so I have to regularly take a nasal spray that is a similar steroid that is used in some asthma medication, I have incredibly painful periods and am on birth control for that and I’m on a strong pain reliever for back pain from an injury. 

I take all of these everyday and due to COVID I have a good stock of them so I can avoid going to places sick people may be. But a few days after my cousin came over I started to notice my stock was decreasing in size. At first I thought I was just imagining it or going crazy or had misplaced them . Then I thought maybe my house had been broken into or something because it can’t be my cousin who’s taking them because he’s a sweet innocent guy who could never do that. 

I was hella wrong.

A couple days ago I needed something stored away in the spare room that my cousin was staying in and he was out so I just popped in to grab it. It was just as I was leaving when I noticed a couple of my nasal sprays along with a list on his bed. 

The list had numbers  of my meds he had sold as hard drugs.He’d made a lot of money out of it as he’d written down prices and how much he’d made.

I was furious but also worried about what he’d got himself into. I decided to confront him when he got home. I told him that he can’t do stuff like that, he’ll end up in prison, I have to tell his parents and asked if he was in any trouble with some dodgy people or something.

He screamed at me that I invaded his privacy, he’ll get me sent to prison because they were my medication anyway, if I told his parents he’d tell everyone in our family that I’m setting him up because he wouldn’t sleep with me ( which is crazy I’ve always seen him as a little brother I’d never tried to get him to sleep with me?!?!?!) and he made excuses that it wasn’t that bad because he wasn’t taking them himself. 

I obviously was really upset and told his parents who brushed it off as “ teenagers being teenagers”?! I said he wasn’t welcome in my home any longer and threw him out. He would’ve had enough money for a hotel anyway with how much money he made off my meds.

1034,Not the A-hole,"I've never read the Harry Potter series so I watch it and I just binge watch it in just a few days. My boyfriend (23M) and I (22F) decided to watch it together for the first time. 

I found out that he has a tendency to find something that is interesting and likes to talk about or talk about something that is related to the movie during it. 

Now, I'm about with something like ""whoa, that was cool"" or ""awe. That's sad"" after a scene is over. However, my boyfriend does it while some important dialogue is being said. I've told him ""hold on, hun"", ""wait until this scene is over"", ""hold that thought"" in the nicest way possible. Then I just said ""when you want to talk, can you pause the movie? I want to hear what they say and not have to rewind"". He kept doing it so I just endured it. 

The night he left, I finished the remainder of the movies we had left to see because i didnt want to watch them if he was going to talk. 

This weekend, he came over again and ask me ""do you want to watch HP?"" And I said ""I finished them"". He got really upset and said ""why would you do that? I wanted to watch those with you."" And I said ""I want to know what's going on in the movie without any talking going on."". He just walked into the house all mopey and upset. When we got to my room, I just repeated what I said outside and he said ""you should be able to multitask"". That just grew into a whole fight.

12322,Asshole,"So I feel pretty crummy even typing this out to complete strangers but here goes. My husband and I have been married for 4 years and we have a 1.5 year old together. He works and I agreed to stay at home since the birth of our son. I was earning only about 1/8 of what he was anyways, so we decided the most sensible arrangement since getting married was that I'd become a homemaker and SAHM when we had a baby. 

&#x200B;

I've been a stay at home spouse/mom for about 3 years now and it was fine before the baby. But now there are a lot of things I want to change but don't know how to, especially when it comes to finances which I feel like I have no power over. My husband earns good money but he's very frugal about nonessential spending because he wants to be financially independent (no job, earnings from investments) at an early age. Granted he was like this when I met him but I had also had my own salary at the time to do what I wanted. I'm looser with my money because I like eating out, going out with friends, going shopping, etc. All the normal things people in their 20s buy and do. 

&#x200B;

Well now that I stay at home we have mini fights every time I want to buy anything over $150 (which is the limit he set that needs a ""conversation""). This means if I go out to get clothing, makeup, brunch, little treats, etc. and the amount exceeds $150, I would need to call him beforehand and talk about what I'm buying. It feels extremely restrictive and quite frankly humiliating. He spends so little on himself that it seems like to him that I'm the one spending all the money on myself every month. 

&#x200B;

I've been talking to my sister who's also a SAHM and she says her and her husband have an agreement where she's ""paid"" for childcare/homekeeping. Essentially she gets ""paid"" a few thousand every month to spend on whatever she wants because in their relationship he's also the stingy/frugal one and she wants to have more pocket money for fun things. Right now she says she gets about $3,500 a month because that's how much it would cost them to hire an outside nanny where they live. It's a bit cheaper where we live so I wouldn't be asking as much, but would I be the asshole to suggest a similar arrangement with my husband so I don't need to go groveling for money every time I want to buy myself something nonessential?",990,809,0.83,"AITA for wanting a ""salary"" as a SAHM (stay at home mom)?",bqrzmu,2019-05-20 06:35:25,YTA,2352,AITA
5575,Not the A-hole,"You may have seen a post on this sub about a woman being told not shaving her legs was unhygenic. This is actually related to that. First, some background:

I (18M) have been with my GF (18F) for over two years.

I'm a pretty serious competitive swimmer, so I started shaving my legs about a year ago. GF told me that she liked how my legs felt during sex, so I kept shaving them and moved on to basically my entire body (arms, legs, armpits, genitals, etc.)

We're both active Redditors, and few days ago, my GF saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ct8w0a/aita_for_not_shaving_my_legs_for_work/) about a woman being asked by her boss to shave her legs for work. She thought that was ridiculous (I did too) and told me that she was going to stop shaving to ""protest this sexist bullshit"" and ""help get rid of the expectation that women need to shave.""

I must admit, I was kind of annoyed by this. I thought her reasoning was terrible (and, let's be honest, I much prefer the feeling of shaved skin on shaved skin). I wouldn't have any problem with this if she, say, thought it was too much work (that shit takes a long time). I just didn't want to support her pointless ""protest.""

We went back and forth for a few minutes, and it ended with me telling her that I'd stop shaving down as a protest against stupid arguments. Swimming's in the off-season right now, so it's not going to affect my performance

She hasn't spoken to me in over a day. I also haven't shaved in over a day.

Now my wife cooks fine for the kids but she's lazy when it comes to cooking for me. We live in metropolitan mumbai and I work as a doctor. She is a housewife, and has recently restarted her career as a physiotherapist a couple of months ago.
She complains when I ask for food, at what according to her are odd hours, even though I have strictly told her I eat when I am hungry and only what I like.

7527,Not the A-hole,"I’m [26F]  currently pregnant for the second time (yay!) I have a daughter, 3F.

For my baby shower, I decided to include a gender reveal (cheesy, I know) at the end. I had a cake made and the inside of the cake would be pink for a girl or blue for a boy. I thought it was a very cute idea, not over the top like other gender reveals, and my husband thought so too. 

I invited about 18 friends and their families, including my own family. So it was a rather large gathering. One of my friends, 26M, is dating a transwoman. They have been together for 8 months and I have met her several times. I wouldn’t say we’re extremely close, though.

Anyways, the baby shower happened on Sunday. It was quite nice and everyone had fun. Then, my husband got the cake out and told everyone that the colour of the filling inside would reveal the gender of the baby. It was a surprise and people were “awwing” and saying how it was so cute. My mother even teared up.

My husband and I cut the cake. It was blue so that means we’re getting a boy! I was really excited and it was just a great moment.

At the end, my friend’s trans partner approached me and asked if she could talk with me. Firstly, she thanked me for the party. Then she said that she was surprised by the gender reveal bit at the end, and that she was disheartened by it. She said we seemed like “really forward thinking people”, but that having a gender reveal and calling it that in this day and age is backwards thinking. She said the only thing that it reveals is that my baby has a penis. She said that her parents gendered her to be a boy growing up althought she wanted to be a girl and that it really messed her up. 

I defended my actions and said I “didn’t think too much into it” and said that saying “it’s a boy!” is much better than saying “my baby has a penis!” especially in front of all my friends and family. 

She said, “Well maybe you can be more open minded when raising your child.” She also told me that if I was planning to do a gender reveal, I should not have invited her because she thinks it was very offensive and almost triggering to go through it. 

I thanked her for my input but said at the end of the day, it’s rather rude of her to tell me how the baby shower should have been done or how to raise my son. She seemed upset when she left.

I told my husband afterwards about the interaction and he said I was right for telling her to mind her own business. Plus, he says that it’s not our fault that she was offended by the gender reveal.

we then had to deal with a crying 13 year old on Christmas.

she then proceeded to explain to me how we shouldn't let some family members cook certain food because of some instances where they fucked up and ruined the dish (this is all completely false information that she is mentioning to try and start some more family drama)

I love my mother more than anything and there is no bias involved towards my sister. I wanted my mother to find a good man she loves and when she did I encouraged her to get a child with him.

I was 20 when my sister was born. Her father sadly died few years after that and I was super glad that my mother still had my sister because I couldnt be there for her as much as I wanted to.

Now I never had a ""real"" relationship with my sister. I live rather far away so I just visit a few times a year, send gifts on special occasions etc.
I think that's why I dont really feel anything towards her. I wish her all the best and wouldn't ever wrong her, but I dont love her. I probably dont even like her. My mother on the other hand really, really wants us to have this amazing bond of big sister-little sister that love each other and so on. I feel terrible because I simply dont feel anything. I am closer in age to my mother than I am to my sister. I simply cant see how with this age gap and distance we can have a dream relationship. But I never said anything to my mother and always act like I love my sister and would do anything for her.

But I really want to spend time with my mother alone. My sister is 6 now, she is very social and doesnt really have an issue with staying with relatives or a baby sitter besides not having my moms attention. Still the only time we spent just the two of us when I visited is when she was asleep.

Now I got invited to a ceremony for top 500 apprentices in our region where I'll get a certificate and it's generally to honor the best of this year. I can bring two guests, so I decided to invite my mother and my bf.

I really dont want my sister to be there. She is a kid and she doesnt know how to behave properly and needs all the attention there is. It's not her fault, but I want this to be about me for once and not about ""Look what your sister accomplished"".

I really like him, he's great. And they are so great together! I'm happy that she is finally happy. I've known my fiance for 10 years and have been 'together' for 6 or 7 years. Things are great with us, too.

At dinner, we were talking about old memories and laughing. Generally having a good time all around. We eventually talked about how much dating has changed over the years and now the majority of people meet online/through an app. I should mention here that my sister met her boyfriend on a dating app. Nothing wrong with that, it is 2019. Then my sister brought up my ex because I had met my ex online but before all these apps were status quo (12+ years ago).

Back then, I got sooo much shit from my family about how I met my ex. They all were less than nice to me and to him and it's something I've never forgotten. That relationship lasted 2.5 years but eventually we broke up but for other reasons. When I look back, I do have the 'what the hell was I thinking' reaction that everyone has when they think about their exes but I also have a bit of sadness and anger towards my family about how I was treated. So obviously, I don't like going back there. My sister just kept talking about my ex and how unsafe meeting people online was back then and I'm so lucky he didn't end up being a sexual predator or serial killer! She and my parents were talking about my ex and how horrible he was while myself, my fiance, and her BF just stayed quiet. Honestly, my ex was a nice guy, just not for me, so I took offense to what was being said as I was also being painted as being foolish.

I'm not proud of what I did but I loudly said something like ""Ahhh, this must be the portion of the family dinner where we all talk about our past relationships! Does anyone else want to talk about their exes? Dad, how about your exwife from when you got married at 20? Mom, anyone? BF and fiance... do you want to talk about any of your exes? Sister, how about we talk about your exHusband or exBF? I heard exhusband is finally selling the house.""

My fiancé (41F) is amazing.  She’s changed my (41M) life.  All I want to do is be with her and make her happy.   Her name is a very common and simple last name and you’d need to look over 10 pages of the phone book to find her.

I grew up Mormon.  I love my family, and we all have loved our last name.  Its strong, iconic, unique.  I’ve always loved it until I realized many of the things I’ve been taught was a complete sham and that I’ve been in a cult.  It’s made me make the worst decisions and I’ve been thru hell trying to get myself out of the hole.  I am absolutely devastated by this, my life with true happiness had only begun a few years ago when I left the church.

My dad is amazing.  My brothers and sisters and brother in law are amazing.  From small Conversations I feel like they know the church is wrong but stay because of tradition and the pleasing of their parents (many of who are dead) and for the simple fact that if they left they’d have to come to grips with all the time and money they’ve spent was a sham.  

What upsets me is “what about the next generation?”  We’re not doing what’s right for them to stay with something that isn’t honest.

Anyways, I would like to take my sweethearts name for the following reasons:
-  she is amazing and I want to be everything she stands for.  All I want to do is make her happy.
-  my name doesn’t represent who I am anymore
-  id like to send a message that what is happening with Mormon children is not right.  

I should note:  she has two children with her name.  I have 4 with my name.  To change my name would mean my 4 children would have a name different then me.

Also note:  the Mormon religion is very traditionally patriarchal, so I think that my taking the her name would be absolutely insulting to almost everyone related to me.

10579,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because friends know my reddit and this is the kind of family drama they don't really need to know. ANYWAYS, years ago my grandmother passed away. In her will she left the house to my dad, however she had talked to him about this and it was simply so someone had complete control over the property and she didn't trust my uncle with it. My dad agreed that any money made from the sale of the house would be split between my dad and his brother.

&#x200B;

Instead of selling it immediately, they agreed to let my cousin and his new wife move in while they got on their feet. No one really needed the money and this would help them out. My cousin and his wife did sign a contract to live in the house rent free but they had to pay utilities and property tax while there. They lived in the house longer than anticipated, so now the house is the ""cousins"" issue. There are 5 of us, myself and my brother and my uncle's 3 kids. I am technically the one that owns the house.

&#x200B;

We (all 5 of us) have finally agreed its time to sell the house. We got an offer on the house and so I called everyone up so we could have a meeting about it because I want to make sure we all agree with it since it is our house. While talking about this offer it comes out that they think it should be split 20% for everyone. Whereas my brother and I think it should be 50% for my dad's kids and 50% for my uncles kids. And the cousin that lived in the house is saying he should get more because he paid for the utilities and property tax and did upgrades on it so he wants that money back, which I also think is insane because they did all that knowing they were just ""renting"" the house so thats not on us to pay them back for it.

&#x200B;

So anyways they are calling me the asshole and threatening all sorts of things. I've talked to an attorney who looked over everything and he says I am all good and don't have to give them anything (not doing that). But I'm just wondering what you guys think?

My avoidance of alcohol dates back to when I was thirteen, and my then sixteen year-old brother had to have his stomach pumped. My family and friends are well aware of both. 

Moving to the matter itself, every year, my hosts a large Halloween party. Usually, there are around two hundred guests in attendance. For a variety of reasons, my parents are unable to host the event this year, and they asked me to do so in their stead. 

When they asked, I said I would be willing, but I immediately reminded them of my beliefs and avoidance of both alcohol and animal products and how I did not think I would be a suitable host because of them. They said it would be fine. Earlier today, my mother called me. I had emailed her the menu and guest list for final approval. She was furious. 

Apparently, I was unclear when I said I was uncomfortable. My parents thought that when I agreed, I agreed to serve meat and alcohol. They are saying it will be a huge issue at the party. 

I once again suggested having someone else plan it, but, as they pointed out, it’s less than a month away from the party. We really don’t have time for someone else to take over the planning. I don’t want to compromise my beliefs for this event, but I also don’t want to disappoint my parents or their guests.

He was awake and about for an hour or two, where he could have messaged saying oh let's reschedule for x time, but instead he just leaves it and me getting upset cause he just won't say. I think this is really rude! Eventually he says in another hour from now.

None of his children asides those living with him take anything to do with him.  He is an alcoholic,  addicted to drugs and was violent towards my mother when they were together. 

There were also some other aligations I can't say as they weren't proven,  and neither me or my sisters were old enough to remember anyway.  

After my parents split,  my father stayed in the house forcing my mother into emergency housing with us.  My mother would pay him to be in our lives be it taking care of us for a weekend or taking us out somewhere.  And when he took care of himself he would leave me as a 5-7 year old in charge of my 2 younger sisters.  Sometimes he would leave us with a babysitter while he went to the pub,  and we were frequently left around family for a few hours here and there or just left in the house with a friend we wouldn't know to watch over us. 

He would make empty promises and never follow through,  he would yell at me for things he was told off for when taking care of us and it was overall not a nice environment.  He has never payed a penny towards us unless made to by his partner for Christmas gifts.  

When I was 8 my mother blocked contact with him due to a court ruling he cannot be left alone with us while we are under 16 until he has gone through family therapy with us.

15771,Everyone Sucks,"Asking about/for a friend.

My friend's been in a relatively loveless marriage with her husband, let's call him B, for several years, & they have 2 young children together.

I met them both a few years ago, early into the marriage, & have always been cordial with B. They've always seemed like a bad fit for one another. Conflicting personality types, different hobbies, even different tastes in food. But they're married, I always figured they had some deeper connection. Also, I didn't feel I knew her well enough to say anything.

Over the years though, the conflicts between them have escalated, and a few months ago I felt so uncomfortable by a fight they had in front of me that I had to say something to her. I told her it often seemed like they were a bad match for each other, because of their many differences. I also felt he was being mean & dismissive to her.

At that point, she told me a lot that I didn't know. For one thing, the meanness--which she describes as ""contempt""--is apparently a personality trait that she's been trying to parse for years. He seems to genuinely want to understand why she is upset in a given situation, but despite his sincerest efforts, he can't seem to put himself in her position mentally. ""He lacks empathy,"" is what she told me. ""He doesn't mean to, and he doesn't think he does, but he can't understand other ppl's feelings."" And then, she says, he gets mad.

TBH I was a little dismissive of this cuz I thought that was kind of a cop-out way to avoid the real issue of being poorly matched for one another. I asked if she'd ever brought it up to him, she said yes, but he got so offended & angry that she never wanted to bring it up again.

So fast forward to yesterday. My friend told me that they'd been going to see a marriage counselor for a few months. She specifically found a marriage counselor who specializes in spectrum disorders, but not in a conspicuous way, so as to keep the information from B. After several long meetings, the counselor agreed with my friend that yes, B \[might be\] on the spectrum, and yes, he appears to be unable to empathize w/ other ppl. This helped to explain a lot of confusing behavior for my friend, because she did not want to believe that he actually \*was\* as unkind as he had been behaving towards her. The counselor's agreement was comforting to her because it gave her a framework through which to understand his behavior.

My friend feels relieved to have some answers, though of course the challenge now is B doesn't have a clue. It sucks that she did it so secretively, I'm sure he'll think she's an asshole, but I feel like, maybe that's to be expected, given the circumstances?

So... I guess what I'm asking, IS my friend TA for having him evaluated behind his back?

*edit: I did not mean to imply that all people with ASD cannot feel empathy, learn how to act on empathy even if it's not first nature to them, or understand feelings. I do not believe that, & I apologize if it reads that way.

I knew my ex for almost 10 years. We go back all the way to high school and have been friends. After we graduated I said fuck it and asked her out and we became a couple. We dated for almost 6 years before she came to me and told me she was pregnant. I won't lie, I loved her at the time and this was actually quite exciting to me so i proposed. She, however, seemed super worried. I sat down and talked with her about it. I told her that even if she did decide to terminate the pregnancy I would be by her side and still wanted to marry her. She was super awkward about it but decided to keep the child and accepted my proposal.

These past 7 months have been a roller coaster. She moved in with me and we began getting ready for our daughters birth and we were planning on getting married after she is born. That was until a few weeks ago. An old acquaintance from high school reached out to me. I was never good friends with him but he said that he felt guilty about letting an innocent man suffer for his and my ex's mistakes. This guy claimed that he was the father of my ex's child and that my ex had been lying to me. It turns out that my ex and him got reacquainted about a year ago and started having sex. around the time my ex got pregnant they began having unprotected sex. He is not lying about this. He sent me photos of them together and showed me texts between the two of them. I was able to get my ex's phone and confirmed they were real. Along with this, he sent me a string of Facebook messages of my ex admitting to lying to me because I make more money that the real father and she would rather I care for it.

Suffice to say, I was fucking pissed. I confronted her, she cried, I cried, it was a mess. In the end I broke it off then and there and evicted her from my apartment. She's in the process of moving out now but I have not said a single word to her. I have pretty much told her that I want her out of my life. I also demanded a DNA test the minute the child is born. If it is mine, i'll help her support it. If not, then I am never seeing her again.

I've been cold to her. Her and her parents has tried multiple times to ""work it out"" with me but I've refused any contact with them. At one point she got all of her friends together to try to talk to me and I kicked them out of the apartment with threats of calling the police. Any time she's tried to ""Reconcile"" i've shut it down,

My friends are saying i'm in wrong here. According to them she's pregnant and because of that I should at least be helping her till the baby is born even if it isn't mine. I disagree fully.

Let me clarify, that I have always been considerate in regard to smoking in front of children/adolescents. If I see a kid, I don’t care if we are in the middle of a session, I’m putting it out. I don’t agree with smoking ANY THING in front of kids, because I believe it sends the wrong message.

The only 2 things I ever did that was remotely close to that is posting a screenshot my friend send me saying he has negative storage on r/softwaregore, and posting a video of a dad getting a Ferarri from his son on r/HumansBeingBros but I titled it as ""Buying dad a Ferarri"" (Forgot the ""a"".)

&#x200B;

So for some reason, a guy in school found me by sorting by new and he recognized a picture that we've both seen, and sure enough, he found it. He started commenting on every single post I've made then talking about it on school.

&#x200B;

Ok, it was a joke, haha he found my Reddit username ""LOL it should be a secret haha"". Ok.

&#x200B;

Then, he proceeds to creepily stalk it. Like way too much. I repetitively tell him to stop, but I guess you can take it in a joking matter. Sure.

&#x200B;

Then, today, I tell him if he doesn't stop, I will dead-ass delete it. He continued to joke about it, and starts telling everyone about something I posted on r/teenagers, which was a goddamn COPYPASTA, and sure as hell, they don't believe it's a copypasta. Then I get home, and another guy starts posting every meme on my feed on a group chat.

&#x200B;

At this point, I'm just pissed. Reddit is supposed to be anonymous, it's literally on a wiki. It's not Facebook, it's your private area to do whatever you please without worrying about people you know irl shoving their hairy ping pong sacks into everything and pulling their hot dogs out of their pants on you. 

&#x200B;

So I delete the account. It's not going to stop, and either way, once someone knows the username they can unzip your pants at any moment they wish. And after a long ""conversation"", I told him to fuck off, and I'm going to stop talking to him for a while. I spent almost 10 months on that account and I was forced to reset.

&#x200B;

Look, I know it's Reddit and this shouldn't be a big deal, but please take into consideration that I'm the stereotypical 15-year-old guy who makes memes to make myself feel happy. Also, I guess it was also embarrassing af to have people believe I actually said something, which in reality, is copypasta.

194,Not the A-hole,"Hello! I’m really upset at the moment. I know this sounds immature and silly. We’re both 24 btw. 

So my boyfriend has been working from home while I’m just in grad school. I lost my job due to everything. Now my boyfriend’s work from home is really easy imo. He has his gaming computer open playing games all day with his work laptop open and checking for notifications/call requests. 

The game he’s been playing while he’s at work is Hearthstone if anyone is familiar with it. (It’s an online cards game like Magic the gathering I think.... sorry if I’m describing it wrong for any players out there). He tried to get me into it but I found the game extremely boring.

So my boyfriend gets to log off from work around 6-7ish and sometimes even later. Once he’s done we’ll go play Animal Crossing together and work on our island. It’s the little bit of bonding we get throughout the week. 

The problem is my boyfriend has started having Hearthstone on his phone and playing it while also playing Animal Crossing with me. He’ll tell me “hold on” and “give me a min” constantly and slow down our Animal Crossing game playing because I have to wait for him. This bothers me so much because a) he plays the game from 8am to 8pm sometimes while working and b) he’s ruining our little bit of bonding time during the week and c) I find it really immature that he can’t put his phone down to spend time with his girlfriend. He even plays Hearthstone or other gaming YouTube videos while we eat dinner. 

AITA for this? WIBTA if I ask him to not play on his phone while spending time with me at the end of the day? I play video games myself so it’s not an issue with gaming. It’s his frequency of playing it and how he prioritizes playing it over time with me when we have so little at the end of the day. 

Side note: Truly this concerns me because his parents are counting down the clock for grandkids but I don’t see my boyfriend being a responsible parent if he can’t put his phone down and absolutely has to play this game literally from morning to bedtime. Imagine if something happens to our hypothetical baby because he’s more focused on his phone. May be a reach but it truly scares me that I think he could cause something so bad from being glued to his phone.",35,34,0.89,AITA for getting upset over my boyfriend playing on his phone?,g1kgha,2020-04-15 03:51:32,NTA,2264,AITA
14880,Asshole,"My girlfriend and I are in our early 20’s and have been together for 6 months. A few days ago she found out she was selected as a Fulbright finalist and will be moving to Europe in August for 10 months. I’m extremely proud of her and I’m happy that she’s fulfilling her dreams but I can’t help but feel a little sad that she’s leaving. I’ve been trying my best to keep those feelings contained and to just be happy for her but it’s been a little difficult and I’ve sort of been distant with her these past few days. 

Last night we were at a bar celebrating this girls birthday party but also kind of celebrating my girlfriends huge achievement. Long story short, she started posting on Instagram and Snapchat right next to me about how she’ll be living in Europe in a few months and will meet one of her friends in Paris. I didn’t say anything but having her flaunt that in my face when she knows it’s a sensitive subject brought down my mood and made me shut down. She then went to the bathroom so I got on my phone for a little bit and was still on it when she came back because I was reading something. Admittedly, I didn’t really feel like talking at that moment and the phone was my escape but I couldn’t have been on there for more then 5 minutes after she came back. She then told me I looked miserable and to go home if I was having such a bad time. I told her I wasn’t having a bad time and I was here for her. I questioned why she was upset and she kept telling me to just go home because I looked miserable but I said no. She said she was leaving and Ubering home then and as I followed her out of the bar she kept turning around telling me to stop following her. She got in her Uber outside and called out to me saying “BABE” implying she wanted me to follow her and get in the car but I just said “No, I’m not going with you” so she gave me the middle finger and took off. That last bit made me upset and I texted her afterwards asking what the problem was and said that this wasn’t some game where she runs away and I immediately go chasing after her. She said I looked miserable when I was on my phone and humiliated her because I couldn’t even hold a conversation. Today we talked about it more and she says that she’s incredibly hurt because it’s unfair for her to have to censor her excitement around me. She says my excitement for her isn’t genuine and that I say all the right things but don’t mean them. She says she understands that I’m sad but if the roles were reversed she would at least make sure I felt celebrated and excited first and foremost and that after the celebration we would start having those conversations about how she’s feeling. In response I said, “If it was me getting a huge award I would like to celebrate with you but I would try to avoid flaunting it in your face until we’ve really talked about it. I’d know that something this big is obviously a good thing but it affects you too as my girlfriend so I’d try to be aware of your feelings.”

1163,Asshole,"My relationship with my parents was strained. Out of high school I was threatened that if I didn't attend uni immediately (no year off to work) and I didn't pick an approved study (STEM, law, business) they'd give my education savings to my sibling. I begrudgingly chose a major that they approved. There was a lot of other big issues, such as only being allowed one phone call a week, my door removed off the hinges, and my parents moving their bed so they can watch me while I'm doing homework and sleeping. There's a ton to unpack there but basically I wasn't treated like an adult.  


Later I met someone and started dating. This didn't fit their values and they thought it'd risk my education. After a few big arguments they cut off my funding and I was told I had to move out. Part of me thinks I should have dropped out but I wanted to see it through to the end. I moved in with my partner and took on substantial student loans. I also worked during uni, but still took on a few tens of thousands of dollars in loans.  


I got a dream job after graduating but my area has high unemployment and I was laid off shortly after as part of mass layoffs. I went on EI and have been struggling to find a job; the story is always the same: I'm fighting with thousands of people with decades of experience. My employment insurance runs out next week, and my financial situation is abysmal.  


About a decade ago, my father was permanently disabled by a workplace accident. He fell into a few legal grey areas. Regular disability insurance refused to pay and he went without income while fighting a number of lawsuits. He also lost his pension; my parents financial situation has been abysmal too.  


Recently my father won a major milestone in his lawsuits. He's getting a small pension now but not enough to cover monthly expenses. The judgement includes me getting retroactive payments from the government to pay for my uni, as I should have been receiving benefits for him being disabled while going to uni. Its a hefty sum; equal to just under my entire debt. Since my parents aren't receiving any lump sum from their judgement they are claiming that they're ""entitled"" to this money.  


Despite this, I want to help them. My childhood up until I started university was privileged even after my father was injured. Its still true that they ultimately paid for half my education. If they pay off their mortgage, which it'd help them do, they'll no longer have a negative income. They've promised that if I give them the money they'll help me with my student loans down the road.  


My GF says that if I give my parents the money, I'm choosing their future over ours and that I would be an asshole. Her mother is trying to push my GF to break up with me if I do it, but my GF is leaning toward being a bit more understanding.

14791,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: 

We have our 3yo son and my 6yo stepdaughter whom I’ve been with since before she turned 2. We’re very lucky to have two healthy happy generally well behaved kids. However, they have had their share of meltdowns usually from being tired/hungry/sugar whatever. SD had definitely had worse and louder meltdowns even into the age of 6, due in part to the nature of going back and forth between households but largely due to being very spoiled by my husband’s stepfather and mother since they lived with them before I was around. For example, she would flip out about wanting something and SO’s step dad would coddle her, call her princess and sweetheart and try to give her whatever she wanted in that moment. I once witnessed him drive an hour round trip to get a stuffed animal she was screaming about. He STILL carries her around like a baby and spoils her bad behavior whenever he’s around. She actually pretty much reserves her bad/bratty behavior for when he’s around as she’s pretty good most of the time otherwise.

We were at a big party yesterday, tons of people, kids, candy, loud crowded etc and in the third hour our 3yo had a meltdown about wanting someone else’s play doh or something. He yelled and cried, I’m sure it was annoying and not cool but I was handling it by not giving into anything and was about to take him outside to calm down. This is when stepfather in law says “[3yo son’s name] what the hell is wrong with you?” (Not the first time he made a rude comment to him, but the first time he cursed AT him). I said “excuse me, but please do not curse AT my THREE YEAR OLD.”  To which he kind of awkwardly laughed and didn’t really respond. We left shortly after without saying goodbye.

Now I feel kind of bad for calling him out, and I hate having “drama” with family. I’m sure he just thinks I’m a bitch for saying anything... but dude I’ve never met a 3 year old who hasn’t had a meltdown. This guy never had babies or kids so he doesn’t get it, but I feel like any grown adult should know not to curse at someone else’s kids especially for what I would consider normal behavior. When I say “meltdown” I just mean a couple minutes of yelling and crying, not thrashing around, hitting or taking things. Not even screaming the way my stepdaughter has in front of him while he calls her princess. 

So, I know reddit often hates annoying kids, but yes, I took him outside right away so he wouldn’t annoy people and I’m not saying his behavior was ok, but I feel like it was well within the realm of normal toddler behavior. AITA for calling him out at a party?

ETA: we don’t have “rules” about adults cursing around our kids generally, and even we don’t “watch our language” when talking about other things (we’re from the northeast where saying “fucking” is like saying “um” for many people) but I feel like cursing AT someone is different.",15,26,0.87,AITA for calling out my stepfather in law for cursing at my son’s “bad behavior?”,basrbl,2019-04-08 11:43:15,NTA,2878,AITA
12585,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I have four kids, all grown up. Three of our kids turned out amazing, our fourth has had an extremely troubled past. We definitely bare some of the blame as parents, which is why I am conflicted as to whether this is justified.

For sake of clarity I'll refer to the son in question as John. We found out John was smoking cannabis when he was 13, we don't know when he actually started. A few years after that he went on to start using crystal meth. Ever since he started using meth his problems, and the problems he causes for those close to him, are never ending and they only get worse.

We've tried to help him countless times. We really have. But every attempt as been met with resistance, or with him pretending to want help in order to get money. He steals from us and his siblings for drug money. Everything he does is to get his next fix, and he long since stopped giving a toss about  us and his siblings.

The straw that broke the camels back happened last week. He stole my father's service medals and (presumably) pawned them off for drug money. We don't know where he is (a recurring theme) and have no way of contacting him. Those medals are presumably long gone.

At this point I have just given up. He's not the kid I once knew, he hasn't been in a long time. I honestly want nothing to do with him at this point because all he does his steal and manipulate those that try to help him.

I have given up on him and have cut him out of my life for good. I am asking whether I'm the ""asshole"" because as his parent I clearly fucked up somewhere and set him on this path. Kids don't just become drug addicts for no reason.

Most things are already there so most people just said they will bring sauces/bread/butter. I make these amazing brownies that none of my colleagues have ever tasted since I don't like cooking/baking so when I make them, I only make them for special occasions and mostly only for family and close friends. And since I don't know what to bring i thought why not the brownies. 

So I told them and most of them were like ""oh great, dessert is covered"". But we have a new colleague (Dina) who is allergic to gluten. I don't like Dina, Dina (I think) doesn't like me for some unknown reason, so we generally avoid each other, it's mutual. 

An hour later, Dina approached me and said ""I dont think I can have any of your brownies"". I said ""yes too bad"". ""Could you swap it for gluten free flour?"", I said no because the mild chewy texture of the brownie is something a lot of people like about it and that I really prefer my recipe to not be changed because it may not taste as good, that and I really don't like gluten free bread like foods. 

She said I was being unfair, so I told her another colleague is thinking about making another dessert that doesnt involve gluten and that maybe they should talk. She said okay but its just that pictures of my brownies looked amazing and that she really love chocolate. I just shrugged and left.

6270,No A-holes here,"So eight of us classmates (18-19M/F) are planning on taking a short weekend trip before the beginning of the next term.

One of those classmates is a gay guy T. who's best friends with almost all the girls in the group. He isn't close with any of us other guys. Even when we used to ask him to hang out after class, he always seemed intimidated or put off. I'm not the one to force someone to be my friend, so obviously we never pushed him.

I'm not sure why he has a negative vibe around us guys. We were never homophobic towards him, none of us holds those kinds of views anyway.

So we've been planning the activities for the trip in a group chat and I guess the rest of us guys instinctively assumed T. would want to hang out with girls more. E.g. the girls want to visit this famous shopping mall in center-city on the evening us guys will be going to a concert. There have been more such differences in group planning and we mentally put him in the majority girl group because those are his best friends he normally follows.

Anyway one of the girls told me in private chat yesterday that some of us are being rude by assuming T. doesn't want to do any activities that the guys are mostly interested in. For example, she told me T. told her in private that he's actually interested in the concert but that he doesn't want to ""bother us"" since we haven't asked.

I mean, it's sort of understood anyone can speak up at any moment of the planning and say: ""Hey, I'd like to do this instead"" or ""Sorry XYZ doesn't work for me, can we change it?""

I'm not a mind reader and it's hard to coordinate what each of eight people want already without someone not willing to express themselves. We counted T. in with the girls because that's his usual crew, I have no idea why he thinks he'd bother us by tagging along for the concert, but that's definitely not the case and he could've just voiced his mind.

5915,Asshole,"My 14 year old daughter and I generally have a good relationship, she's well behaved, does well in school and has a good social life. Growing up, both her mother and I were very much of the belief that she should always be playing some sort of sport, tennis, netball, gymnastics, she tried out a bit of everything. She never really found something that she loved, and so now that she is in highschool and has a few more excuses for not wanting to play sports, e.g. homework and social stuff, I've been less strict on making sure she is involved with physical activity.

The past few months I've noticed her just generally moving about less. She walks to and from the bus each day, and does PE at school for under 2 hours a week, so she's not getting nearly the recommended amount of exercise for a kid her age. I've started requiring her to do a bit of exercise each day, not a lot, 10-30 minutes is all. It can be pushups alone in her room, yoga, or if I'm going running I'll drag her kicking and screaming for a few kilometers. Literally anything to just get her off her butt for a bit.

I've made sure she understands I'm not doing it to make her lose weight, or for some reason related to that. I purely just want her being physically healthy, as well as socially and mentally.

Most of the time after a bit of grumbling she does some exercise, but occasionally she outright refuses. I've yet to punish her for refusing, although I definitely give her the old two thumbs down when she does. If she was refusing to do her homework, something I consider equally as important, I would have no problem forcing her to do it, but something is irking me about the general idea of forcing her to exercise when she doesn't want to.

I don’t sit in an office all day, I’m usually walking  the building and dealing with other departments. I just don’t like the added attention that comes with a costume, it actually makes me very uncomfortable.

Two coworkers in my office decided a few weeks ago that our small department would all dress up in matching costumes for halloween. They had a small discussion of who wanted to portray who (we are being characters from a popular movie). I tried to stay out of the conversation, and tried to passively give them a hint by saying “oh I don’t really dress up for Halloween..” This was ignored and they assigned me the last unpicked name.

These two coworkers spent a whole weekend buying supplies and making props to go with the matching costumes. They are asking that everyone wear specific clothing to go along with the theme.

2153,Not the A-hole,"I'm 38/M and got engaged to my Fiance two years ago at Christmas (he's 41/M) and the plan was to have both my sisters as 'groomsmaids' to glam up the wedding party and help us out in the run up -like a groomsman/bridesmaid role combined. Three weeks ago I wrote to my older sister (with parent's knowledge) to say I still have a lot of love for her and would love to share our day with her as our guest, but don't feel she's able to carry out the role anymore. Since then the messages she's sent me have been abusive, angry and have refused to see my point of view at all. I feel like she doesn't treat me as an equal and that I can't rely on her to put my feelings first, but am seriously thinking I should just give in so that the heartbreak ends and my parents give me an easier ride.

The reasons behind my decision are mainly:

1. Since we got engaged, my sister's marriage has broken down and while my fiance +I have tried to offer support +love where we can, each time we have reached out it's been met with 'Your life is so perfect now, but it won't always be like this +I'll remember how smug you've become.' She's told me that she feels like I've become a 'Stepford Wife' character and that I have forgotten my roots and the rest of the family.
2. At my cousin's wedding overseas in May, my sister spent a lot of the trip drunk and messy, making jokes at my expense and when I asked her not to, creating drama that I was being unfair to her. We were in a similar situation - surrounded by a mix of family that we don't see often (Dad's side) and strangers from the wedding party's family and friends. The only difference was that I was taking time to try and get to know everyone rather than partying all the time. I gave up trying to reason with her after 3 days as she wasn't listening, and asked my dad to please intervene. He spoke to her briefly but she didn't listen, and then on the wedding day she got so drunk at the reception that she fell over and wet herself. I felt terrible for her, and reached out the next day only to be told to leave her alone cos I didn't know how difficult life was for her. 
3. I live some 160 miles from my sister, in the North-west of England-she lives where we grew up, near London. In the 7-and-a-half years I've lived up here, she's been to see me once - 7 years ago. All other times, I've travelled down to see her - about a 7-hour round trip - and juggled that alongside working full-time and my life up here. I've visited 10-15 times a year on average, as my job in sales luckily allows travel. In the run-up to the wedding there will be dress fittings, stag and hen parties and other social things that I know she won't bother coming to because 'it's too difficult to travel' - I feel like it's not just turning up +putting a dress on, it's getting involved and supporting in the run up to the big day.

18292,Not the A-hole,"I live on a busy street in Los Angeles and there's no place to stop a car in front of my apartment building. It's also on a hill, which reduces visibility for oncoming cars. There are two small side streets where drivers can pull off, both about equal distance from my building. I've been using DoorDash's no-contract delivery option. My current instructions read, ""You shouldn't stop your car on (Street Name). If the building's front door is locked, you can leave the food outside. If it's unlocked (directions to my apartment, which is \~50 feet from the front door)."" I don't specify which side street they should pull onto because they're equal distance and I figure they can choose based on the direction they're coming from.

Since I started using the no-contact option, I've been texting the drivers the last 2 sentences of my instructions. I leave out the part about the street because: 1) it's the first part of the instructions, so I figure it'll catch their eye when they see that, and 2) this street is obviously busy and stopping in front of my building is clearly a bad idea. If you're familiar with LA, think Wilshire or Sunset but with no parking lanes and a hill blocking visibility.

A few days ago, I ordered DoorDash and did everything I've described above. I got the message that the driver was approaching, and about 30 seconds later I heard someone banging on the building front door. I really didn't want to go outside because I'd gotten over being sick (small fever and cough you get the picture) just a day before, so I copy pasted the entire instructions and texted it to him. The banging kept up. I felt that maybe he hadn't seen my texts and the noise was probably disturbing my neighbors, so I went out, got the food, thanked him, and turned to leave quickly.

He said, ""look out there,"" pointing to the street. I looked out and saw a car parked in the turning lane in the middle of my street. He said, ""That's my car. You can't have people stopping there, it's very dangerous."" I told him that I knew it was dangerous and that's why I said in my instructions not to stop his car on this street. He continued to say how dangerous it was, how people can't stop there, etc. and I repeated that the instructions said not to stop there. Then, he said, ""okay, okay"" like he was annoyed, and we went our separate ways.

I gave him two stars instead of five because he didn't follow my instructions at all. I was very annoyed that he seemed to think it was my fault he parked his car in the middle of a busy street, and that I didn't get a no contact delivery. My boyfriend says I'm an asshole because if DoorDash drivers get below a certain (high) rating, they get fired, and times are tough right now. That got me feeling a little bad. I don't want him to get fired for this one thing, but I don't regret my rating because it will be one of many, many ratings and if he's usually a great driver, my low rating won't matter. AITA?

One of my good friends from college, lets call her L, is getting married this weekend and has been planning this wedding for about a year now.   Originally, I was not given a plus one although I had a boyfriend since before she even got engaged.   Whatever, I can deal.

Earlier this month at another friends wedding (whom did give me a plus one and boyfriend knew about months in advance), L finally meets my boyfriend and gets drunk and invites him to the wedding.   He obliged at that time so the next day I send L his info.  Fast forward to 11 days before her wedding, I tell L that I didn't think my boyfriend would make it because it is the last day he could move.  Specifically, he and I have just moved in together and he's taken the entire month to make the move.  In his words, he's got a lot going on and really needs the Saturday to himself.   I can confirm that, he has a very demanding job.

This is where I need your help.   As soon as I told her this, L flips out at me and tells me that he has to come since that Friday (I had told her Monday morning) she already finalized the guest count and sent in the deposit.   Then, 3 days ago, my other friend E who is also a bridesmaid flips out on me about my boyfriend not coming since it was ""a very expensive wedding"".

I know I’m probably the asshole but here goes.
Me and this girl have been dating for about 8 months. I met her maybe a year ago initially. She is a very modest person. The closer we are getting the more i am finding out about her. Fast forward a couple of months I notice she has A LOT of leg hair. She was very self conscious about it and would only wear pants in front of anyone. Including me. She never had shaved, so it’s a lot and it did surprise me A LOT. I have never even seen a women past a couple months not shaven. So this was a surprise. However I didn’t really mind. 

Now she is on the fence for shaving or not and asked if I would like it. I said yes it is something I find more attractive than i shaved legs. I told her honestly. She started talking about how I just think that because it’s a western ideology and all that stuff and now she doesn’t want to shave. She doesn’t say if it looks bad or good to her. She just says she won’t do it now because I think she’ll look better. 

I don’t know how to think about this, because honestly it’s a big deal to me. I never thought of a girl having that much hair, she says she has PCOS so it makes her more hairy. I get that and I always offer her help manage her unwanted hair. She says there’s too much and never lets me help. I’m trying everything to help her and make her feel better and also help me feel good when we are touching each other. Her hair hurts, mine is smooth but hers is long and kind of sharp. And she agrees and always hides it. If I’m an asshole I understand I can open my mind more. This is just a lot for me to take in at the moment. I am trying my best to say nice things to her. But it’s hurting my head. I am willing to change, but right now it’s a lot.

Edit: I’ve talked to her. She said she was in the wrong because she said she wanted to shave first and then I agreed and wanted it.

It sounded like the perfect destination, as neither my partner nor I had been before and it was very convenient to get to. 

By coincidence, the weekend we'd chosen to go away was the same as my friend's anniversary trip. My partner asked if I thought they might have a problem with us going to the same town on the same weekend as them.

I think they were mainly upset that I'd decided to take someone I've been dating for two months on the same trip they'd planned for a significant anniversary.

I told my BF to just chuck the clothes in (mostly my underwear and 1 dress) when the washer was done. So I leave and come back to ask my BF where my clothes are. He said that he only did one load before he needed to leave so he just left the clothes there for next time. Ok cool. We went there 2 days later and ask his mom where my stuff is. She doesn't know. I look everywhere and think hmmm that is weird I really need to wash my underwear. 2 more days pass and I ask her again where are my clothes?

My parents have managed to get better jobs and they're making roughly double what they were. My brother (19M) is going through college now and is having a much easier time than I did. My parents are paying for half of his tuition and he hasn't bothered to find a part-time job yet. 

&#x200B;

What really bothers me though is that my parents recently bought him a car for $20,000. I asked my mom how they were able to afford such an expensive purchase and she mentioned that they've been saving a little bit (like \~1k-3k a year) for the last \~20 years and have been spending some of their savings lately. I then asked her (mostly joking, but I was hurt by this point) where that money was when I was in college and she responded with ""well, if you could drive we'd have bought you a car then too"" (I didn't get my license until after college).

&#x200B;

Yes, I understand that I didn't need a car and couldn't drive when I was in college. But I worked my ass off, gave back to my family, and would have benefited from that type of money. I'm not saying that my brother needs to have 3 jobs or pay his own tuition -- but a car is way too much. It bothers me that my parents got mad at me when I bought myself a $1k vacation but they bought my brother a $20k car. 

&#x200B;

If I bring this up to my parents, I'm sure it won't end nicely. Instead, they'll say that I'm ungrateful, don't understand we didn't have much money then, am jealous of my brother, and so on. My parents will also argue that since I'm almost finished my graduate degree, I'll soon be able to buy my own car and don't need their help. But I'm not asking them to buy me a car, I'm hurt that they didn't offer that type of money when I needed help.

So Reddit, WIBTA is I called out my parents on this? I've tried to be as unbiased as possible describing the situation, but I encourage you to think from their perspective and my brother's as well.

575,Asshole,"I'm 29, she is 28. My wife had been away visiting her parents for the past 5 days. One night, around 7, I decided to invite a few friends over to our basement. The basement is a great place to hang out in general and we often throw parties there. 

&#x200B;

At around 9:30 I just decided, screw it, lets invite a bunch of friends and throw a little party. About 15-20 people came to the basement and we had a party. Me and my wife casually do this a lot, invite a bunch of people over for a party. I didn't assume it was a big deal. Nobody ever goes upstairs, everything is contained to the basement. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, wife came back 2 days after. Everything was fine and dandy, I didn't even think to tell her about the party because again, I didn't think it was a big deal, and she was already stressed about her parents so I didn't care to tell her about anything here. Then she looked in the garbage outside and saw about a hundred beer cans in there and a bunch of bottles of liquor. She asked me what it was, and I mentioned I had thrown a party in the basement two nights before. She right away got insanely mad at me. Like ""YOU THREW A PARTY IN OUR HOUSE AND DIDNT EVEN TELL ME!!?"" kind of mad. I just told her I was sorry, I didn't think it was a big deal. Then she started getting accusational and asked me why I was throwing an entire party and not telling her, as if I was hiding something. We got over the fight quite a while ago, but I still think about it a lot. 

&#x200B;

If this was actually in the house, like on the first and second floor, that is a big deal. But our basement is just sort of empty except for a couch, a TV, a stationary bike, a punching bag, some boxes with useless shit in them, a tiny bathroom, and... that's really it. Its a huge basement, 90% of it is just empty. There is practically nothing to destroy or even make a mess of. Not to mention we've thrown like 15 parties in the basement before in the past 5 years we've been living here.

15574,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend and I were using the pull-out method and I got pregnant. I know, stupid. We've since started using condoms. 
I got the abortion pills (which we'd agreed I'd take if it ever came to that) and took them at home this weekend.

About 5 minutes after I took the pills, my boyfriend headed out to the gym. He asked me if I wanted to come as he was leaving, so I texted asking if he seriously thought I should work out while miscarrying, and he responded that he had forgotten. It bothered me a little that he didn't think to stay with me, but I figured I'd handle it on my own, so I didn't ask.

Less than a half hour later, I was in horrible pain, uncontrollably puking all over the bed, so I called him and asked him to come back. He came right away and put the sheets in the laundry, and everything else in the bathtub (I washed them the next day). He asked me if he could go back to the gym, but then seemed to feel bad (I was curled up in agony at this point) and said forget it. 

He stayed home for the rest of the night and got me water and ice packs whenever I needed them, which I really appreciate. 

But I was in horrible pain for hours, and I kept asking him to talk to me to distract me, and he would say like a sentance, and then go back to reading on his phone, until I reminded him to talk again. He kept saying he couldn't think of anything to say, but.  
A- he's a massively talkative person who I've spent hours listening to when he's on long winded rants, and now suddenly when I need him to say literally anything to keep me distracted, he's speechless.   
B- I asked if he'd read me a book, and he kept changing the subject when I'd suggest it.

I get not wanting to entertain someone for hours, but considering this pregnancy was both our responsibilities, yet I was the one going through the hell of the abortion, I feel like it's a fair ask that he at least read me a book while I sit in pain for the both of us.

I told him that I feel like he spent his time wishing he was anywhere but there, and he pointed out that he helped a lot and I wasn't being appreciative.

I'm grateful that he gave me physical support for what I couldn't get on my own, but I feel like he dropped the ball on emtional support, which I really needed.

AITA for being mad at the lack of emotional support? Should I just be grateful for the support he did provide and let it go?

Edit: people keep suggesting that my boyfriend was going through emotional distress over the abortion which caused him to shut down. He wasn't. I discussed it with him before and after. Neither of us were conflicted, feeling guilty, or otherwise stressing over the emotional aspects of the pregancy.

Regarding going to the gym, he stayed even after I texted him about the abortion, because he thought it would start at least an hour after I took the pills, so he'd have time to work out and come back. I'm not mad about that, he didn't know and he came back when I asked.

18859,Not the A-hole,"BACKSTORY:

I failed my first 400-level  physical chemistry test 2 months ago. I barely passed my second one last month.I noticed I scored significantly below class average on both and the curve wasn’t quite what I expected it to be. (That’s ok, labs + hw keep my grade at a high B)

Side Note: The class is about 60 people. Unbeknownst to me, It fills up quickly every semester because people think the professor is ‘easy’. I didn’t know this. The class just fit my schedule and I certainly didn’t think it was ‘easy’ after those 2 exams.

Here’s the catch: Our professor is old and I noticed during exams that many people were suspiciously using their phones. I heard rumors that someone had posted the test questions to a relatively well-known site (it will remain unnamed)  and some students had used that to score A’s and B’s. (We can’t really use the site for homework help because of our homework structure, but a lot of us use it for test review & test prep, which is extremely helpful). Our tests are LONG -we get 2 and a half hours for each test- which gives these students plenty of time to post the questions and receive the answers online. 

EXAM DAY:

I was EXTREMELY irritated when I heard this. This rage really fueled me and I over-prepared for Test 3. I studied like crazy  for it because I felt like these cheating students were robbing me of points from a regular curve. I was able to finish the test in about 45 mins of the given time. I didn’t know everything, but I felt pretty great about what I turned in.  I was the second student done with the exam and felt pretty good as I wrapped it up. 

Once I finished and began walking out, I looked around and saw a ton of people cheating. I was so angry and so distraught, that I used my free time after the test to go on the site and see if my peers had posted the test questions. Of course they had. I had memorized all of the questions (there was only 6) and found 4 of the questions had been posted online.  I answered ALL of them incorrectly, though I made the process look somewhat legitimate. I realized that if I answered those questions first, the real site tutors wouldn’t answer them in the given time (I was right). 

PRESENT DAY:

I scored a high B, and the curve put my grade at an A. 

I had the fourth-highest score on the exam.

Most students failed, even though I found this test to be much easier and much more manageable than the previous two. I looked at the tests of my peers as we compared results. We always compare the partial-credit points to make sure our grades are fair. I saw that a LOT of them (I’d estimate about 13-15 students based on what I saw ) used the ”fake” methods I had used on those incorrect answers.  More students failed this test than the second test, and it was pretty evident that I’d screwed some of the cheating students. 

I honestly can’t say I feel bad about what I did. I worked hard, and their lazy efforts directly impacted my GPA and my future. 

EDIT: 
A common argument I see here is “See you studied and did better! Just keep doing that!” 
I studied like a maniac. I didn’t go out, didn’t attend meetings, just had total focus on this one test. It’s a completely unsustainable level of study and was only possible because I didn’t have much going on in my other classes.",3144,23034,0.78,AITA for intentionally posting the wrong test answers on a cheating website?,dyi6m8,2019-11-19 09:29:07,NTA,3300,AITA
1419,No A-holes here,"Hello!

Recently (\~1.5 month and a half ago) I moved across the country for a job opportunity. I'm 25 and it's the first time I'm living a good distance away from my parents. I've got a few friends from university who live in the area, and I'm settling in pretty well to the changes. However, I'm worried that my mom isn't. She texts me every day, sometimes multiple times a day, about updates and general stuff. I didn't mind in the beginning but it honestly has started to bother me, makes me feel roped down, etc. I love my mom, but it was getting to be a bit much as I'm adjusting to things here. Then I feel guilty about feeling annoyed. Awkward cycle.

She and my brother have a different relationship where they text pretty often, and that's fine, but I don't feel like we really have/had that. I told her this over a phone call and feel guilty that I may have made her upset. I'm thinking I want to compromise where we have a phone call once a week might be good?

4143,Not the A-hole," 

So I work at Walmart, in Grocery Home Shopping, which is a whole different dimension compared to the rest of the store. to start off, About a week ago my manager pulled me into his office to bitch about wait times being too high, and that I'm not fast enough despite the fact that sometimes I'm literally the only one who is trying to work fast (or even at all). On some nights co workers just sit there and talk or look at their phone while I'm stuck having to explain to everyone in the parking lot why they had to wait 20 minutes. I later found out He didn't bother talking to the slackers. This pissed me off and kinda killed my motivation to do anything more than the bare minimum.

Fast forward to today we had 4 dispensers for the entire day, but we found out that all of us were going to be leaving before 8:00 (our closing time) my shift ended at 5:00pm Maria's at 4:00pm Alexandra's at 5:30pm and Jim at 3:30. We looked at the schedule to see if anyone was coming after we all left, and there was literally not a single associate scheduled after 6pm. soon, Gabe (the manager) rose from the darkest,of hell (happens once a year) to ask Maria if she wanted to cover the closing shift, to which she declined because she doesn't want to dispense anymore,

he turns to the rest of us, Alexandra had dinner plans already made and Jim had already disappeared at this point. So i was the only one without plans after work. Going back to what i went over in the beginning, i was bitter towards Gabe and not really looking forward for covering his ass considering he brought this on himself.

I knew he still had options, using one of the support managers, or pulling one or two cashiers off a register, but naturally he chose to just clock out on time and let someone else figure it out. So i let the support manager know what was going on and quietly left 15 minutes late. there really weren't that much orders for the night, we finished every pick by 3:00 which is an hour before it is supposed to be finished, and there were only 3 orders to be dispensed between 6-7 and 4 between 7-8, so whoever is covering me while i sit back, drink a beer, write this post is probably just sitting around, waiting for the clock to hit eight

The reason i think i may be TA here is that;

1. Some Support Manager who has like a million things better to do is sitting in the OGP backroom waiting for that one customer to arrive at 7:59
2. Gabe's precious ""Numbers""(wait times for groceries) that he bitched at me about might of taken a hit if there's no one there to dispense
3. i may of indirectly hurt Alexandra because she told me she didn't want to just let Gabe take the fall, and may of stayed past her shift (i don't know if she did or not)

Reasons im NTA:

1. I don't HAVE to work overtime
2. Gabe is a doo doo head
3. There wasn't that many orders, very slow night which is uncharacteristic for a Saturday

12619,Asshole,"When I got home from work today, I decided to treat myself and order pizza for dinner tonight.  There was a nice deal for a pizza, side and 2-liter, and with the tax and delivery fee, the total came to $24.29.

I've ordered from this company several times before, and in spite of the fact that the store is less than a mile away, it almost always takes at least an hour for the food to actually arrive.  I generally don't mind because it's still reasonably warm and is within the time frame for me to eat dinner, but the delay is definitely noticeable.

Anyway, I was paying by card, and there was an option to tip the deliver person, so I figured I'd go ahead and round the bill up to $25.00.  The deliver person (male, 20-24ish) arrived approximately an hour and twenty minutes after I received my order confirmation, and handed everything over.  However, after I said thanks and went to shut the door, he mumbled something, put my receipt on the pizza box, and then put three quarters on the box before turning and walking away.

I couldn't hear what he had said, and my initial reaction was to think that they had somehow overcharged my card on accident.  But after a few seconds, I realized that he was essentially rejecting my tip.

4413,Not the A-hole,"Using a throwaway and changing a few minor identifying details for this, since my family knows my reddit username.

I know this might sound like a shit-post or validation post, and I have a feeling I know how this is going to go, but my husband asked me to post on here since we cannot come to an agreement on this.

For some quick background, I have had a pet cat since about 6 years before I met my husband. I love my cat. I am a huge animal person, and a softy for animals. I once cried over a Facebook post about a dog being left alone at the animal shelter after all the other dogs were adopted (To be fair, I was also like 8 months pregnant). My husband and I also got a dog together about 2 years ago. 

My husband HATES my cat. The reasons why he hates him is because...well...he's a cat. He liked to swat at my husband's feet when he's sleeping, and walk on his face and meow, which is why he's not allowed in the bedroom at night. He also has a habit of jumping on the counters and knocking stuff over (again, you know....cat stuff). He has also clawed at my husband's ankles a few times. I think at this point he's picked up on the fact that his ""step-dad"" doesn't like him, and is responding accordingly.

We recently had our first baby, and we are both extremely protective over her. (She's a newborn, we're first time parents). Sometimes when we're relaxing/watching TV, she will hang out on a baby lounger pillow on the couch next to us. 

A few weeks ago, our dog chased our cat across the house and the cat leaped over the couch to get away from him and almost landed on the baby. My husband told me that if it happened again and the cat landed on the baby, he would ""throw it against the wall.""

Now, a few weeks before this occurred, our dog did the same thing...BUT, landed on the baby partially. The dog was reprimanded and put in time out. My husband didn't witness it but was told it happened. There were no threats of violence towards the dog, but he has said if the dog ever bites the baby, he's going to the pound.

He says that his reasoning for all of this is ""if it happens once, then it will happen again."" 

I don't even know how the conversation came up again tonight, but I told him that if he ever threw my cat against the wall, or the dog, that I wouldn't want to be married to him. I'm equally concerned about the baby getting hurt, she is my priority but I just don't think physically assaulting a cat is a reasonable response to this. He disagrees.  What say you, reddit?

8960,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I recently went on a week long vacation with our two young kids including our 7 month old. During that time we had contractors come to our home to do some extensive work water-proofing our basement.  They were set to arrive the same morning we were departing.  

Before leaving and a couple hours before they arrived that morning, I emailed some instructions to them, including that they should not unplug the chest freezer we had in the basement.  I also labeled it with a clear sign saying “Do not unplug”.  

Sure enough when we get back a week later we find that they had indeed unplugged the freezer and moved it to another outlet on the other side of the basement.  This would have been fine however it was not a working outlet. 

Inside the freezer was 800oz of breastmilk that my wife had spent many hours pumping each day for the last 7 months since my son was born.  The purpose was so that when she went back to work we would be able to give it to him.  If possible we would prefer to avoid needing to use formula.  It was all melted.  Once it melts you have to feed it to the baby right away otherwise it goes bad.  You also cannot re-freeze it, so was a total loss.  The monetary value of the milk was roughly $1,600.

I messaged the contractor to explain everything that happened and added that they should have been able to work around it (it was connected by a very long cord) and at a minimum they should have double checked to make sure the freezer was working again once they had plugged it back in.  I asked that we come to an agreement to be compensated.  

To the contractor’s credit he called me the next day to apologize and offered to pay us the full amount.  I was a bit surprised he didn’t try to negotiate.  He also mentioned that he fired the foreman that was in charge.  I feel like it was right for me to bring it up with the contractor, but I cannot help to feel guilty for costing someone his job (I had not asked for this), especially since perhaps I could have communicated better about it in advance so maybe there was blame to go around.

I said that I didn’t care who he hangs out with, but it becomes my business when that person is around our 2 year old daughter. 

Eventually it came out that this was his girlfriend, and I asked if I could meet her if she was going to be around our daughter, or if he could maybe have her come by another day when my daughter isn’t there, and if he couldn’t do that then I’d feel more comfortable if my daughter came home with me. We previously agreed to wait until he met my boyfriend before bringing him around my daughter, and even then I waited until I was in a relationship with him for 6 months before allowing him into my home when my daughter was there. He got angry, told me to mind my business and then hung up on me.

I texted his mom and sister and asked if they knew her and could vouch for her before making any irrational decisions, but they hadn’t even met this woman yet. I texted my daughter’s father asking again if I could meet her because I didn’t want to take time away from them, but he just opened my messages and never responded. 

I eventually went over there, and when I got there his girlfriend opened the door while holding my daughter and her father was upstairs doing whatever. I told him I was taking her home because I asked that he’d let me meet this woman, and not only did he ignore me and tell me no, but he allowed our daughter to be by herself with her while he was upstairs for however long.

We don’t have a legal custody agreement, and just sort of came up with a verbal one.

Instead of taking it out and using the bowl I sat next to her, she picks it up and turns on the faucet trying to wash it, as I saw my life flashing before my eyes, splashing water all over the place, and I say you're not supposed to wash chicken because it spreads bacteria, as she says ""what bacteria?"". She then takes one hand off of the chicken and uses it to turn off the faucet, the whole time I'm saying she could have gotten salmonella all over the sink/counter/faucet as she takes the chicken to my cutting board table I use to cut fruit, places the chicken down, and walks over to the fridge (without washing her hands), opens it with her still wet hand, as she starts rummaging through the fruit/vegi drawer.  I tell her she's going to have to wash the handle now and any think else she touched because that could become a breeding ground for bacteria as she yells ""stop pissing me off and just leave me alone, I guarantee you any chicken you've eating at a restaurant was made the same way "".

I went to the bedroom and an hour later I hear her eating and talking on facetime when she tells the person how ""I went psycho over some f\*cking chicken"", ""followed her around telling her how to cook her own dinner"" and how I ""need a reality check"".

for the past week everyday my neighbours toddler aged child has come to our house and continuously banged on the door for at least 10 minutes until i get up and answer it, usually his mum will not even be with him as he has just ran out of their house or she will be at the end of the drive way, she is never actually with him at the door to stop him from banging on it, and even when i tell him my mum isn't home (thats who he wants to see) he wont stop banging, screaming or trying to come inside. usually i'll have to either let him inside to show him that no one is here or i just close the door and let him sit there screaming and crying until his mum decides to do something about it. personally if i wasn't working i wouldn't care like okay just let the kid in show him no one is home and then let him leave without a problem. but now everyday without a doubt he wakes me up and then i find it hard to go back to sleep so i'm not getting any sleep all because of this situation. i've asked nicely if the neighbour can get the kid to come down earlier in the morning so ill still be awake or in the evening so ill be up but she just says that at around midday he gets really upset from having to stay inside and he wont stop screaming until he comes down to my house, but personally i don't see why i should have to sacrifice my sleep because she cant get her kid to stop screaming unless he comes down to my house. 

so AITA for being frustrated that my neighbours child bangs on our door everyday",231,1305,0.95,AITA for being frustrated that my neighbours child bangs on our door everyday,fy8fa2,2020-04-10 04:34:46,NTA,1767,AITA

8973,Not the A-hole,"So a friend of mine, we'll call him ""Tim"" wants to be addressed by  the name ""Thor"". Ok, so let me start off with a little context, Tim and I have been friends for about 10 years, I met him first year of high school and we've been good friends since. The best way i could describe him in one sentence is that hes a hot-headed short fuse kinda guy, so being his friend was a tad difficult.

After high school we started to hang out less due to college/work etc, but we still keep in touch here and there. We were both born and raised in Canada. Tim is Icelandic, Thor is his Icelandic name, apparently Icelandic people have an Icelandic name in addition to their Canadian birth name. In the past he didn't mind people calling him Tim, but always preferred Thor. I recently heard from my circle of friends that he is now demanding people call him Thor, if people don't then he is cutting ties with them as friends. (He doesn't put enough value in long term friendships imo) I haven't spoken to him about this yet but we have a get-together in a few weeks so i will see him then. 

Just to be clear I WILL eventually be addressing him by Thor once I get used to it. My issue is that I've been calling him Tim for 10 years, and I'm just not used to calling him Thor yet. Whats most likely going to happen is something like this: ""Hey Tim! err.. I mean Thor."" Knowing his short fuse he wont like this.

9745,Asshole,"So I'm 20 but I turn 21 in late July. In the past I've never had any problems with my parents letting me drink at home in moderation ever since I graduated high school, things like letting me have a wine cooler with a meal, have a beer watching a movie at home, my mom ordered a rum and Coke and gave it to me at a wedding reception, they let me have a few shots at their friends' New Year's party, etc. Also they told me that as long as turn over my car keys to them for the night they won't question me about going to my friends places or what happened there, so I'll have my friend picks me up or take an Uber if I'm going to a party of my friends at home that'll probably have drinking. 

This summer they basically cut all that off once I got back home. My mom once asked to see my ticket stub when I told her I was going with my friend to a movie (I actually did so it wasn't an issue but I was frustrated by the lack of trust), they aren't giving me liquor or beer ever. When I asked my mom why the big change she said that my dad and her let me drink in limited amounts under controlled situations because they knew I would probably drink anyway and was at college, so this let me do it safely and not feeling repressed where I'd go drinking unsafely or driving drunk. But since I'm turning 21 so soon there's no need for this and the safest thing to do is just wait because it's pretty short anyway. She said she'll allow the occasional wine cooler with a meal until then but that's it.

This makes no sense to me so I kind of blew up at her. Since then I've been almost giving the silent treatment. I also can't believe I'm almost 21 and being treated like I'm back in high school. But now I'm feeling a bit guilty. Was I being a dick?",43,48,0.86,AITA for giving my parents crap for not letting me drink now?,c6qow8,2019-06-28 22:25:17,YTA,1745,AITA
16780,Not the A-hole,"On mobile,sorry for the format and there will be a TL;DR.

So today I finally brought up the subject to my mother that I wanted my father to sit with his wife during my wedding. He and my mother have been divorced almost 20 years and he remarried back in 2004, she remarried 2 years ago but my stepfather passed due to liver failure. She flipped her shit and got professionally offended,saying she wasnt going to share the church pew row with her,she didnt raise me,and I had some audacity to ask her that,as well as treating her like shit. My stepmother has done nothing but treat my father, myself and my brother amazingly. My mom refuses to meet her because she still holds on to the past and constantly spits poison about her and my father. 

My mother made him leave due to constant infidelity,him in general not being around, and religious differences which they couldn't agree on where my brother and I would go to church.

My father did continue with his terrible lifestyle up until the point he had a serious medical issue that almost killed him and from there he turned his life around,getting clean,making time for my brother and I, trying to be apart of our lives, and sticking to his religious beliefs.

For context of our relationship my mother, post divorce for roughly 6 years, would take her anger and frustrations out on me because Iook just like my father and I had given up on myself at school due to constant harassment. Which in turn would cause a vicious cycle, crap beat out of me at school, being put down,wouldnt do my work,bad grades,mom saw grades,beating with a belt. Then her and dad would get into something trivial and she would treat me like crap on top of that,not making me dinner, took everything out but clothes,sheet and a pillow in my room. Would leave me at work with no ride back and would deny my brother coming to get me. Would also try to control every aspect of my life, such as work,extracurricular activities, etc. Which she had managed to do with my brother.

Needless to say once I could drive myself I made myself scarce and she still tried to control me. What caused me to eventually leave was a fight over the car I had bought with my money. After I had left I would live with friends and bounce around town until I managed to get a decent enough job to live on my own a few years back. Back in 2012 she had finally realized how bad she was treating everyone around her and finally got help but it seems over the past few years shes been regressing.

I feel like the day should be about my fiance and I and celebrating our love. As well as everyone enjoying the day and putting personal feelings aside to celebrate with us, at least being civil with each other. Was I an asshole for my request?

TL;DR:
Told my mother I wanted my stepmother to sit with my dad during my wedding,bad divorce between parents,moms a control freak,flipped her shit over the request. AITA?

3100,No A-holes here,"Been with my partner for about 3 years or maybe a bit more now. We lived close to each other and had been friends for years but not that tight until starting to hang out independently. Got into a relationship and it has been the best one I have experienced. I'm into it.

Going into the relationship, we each had a dog.

The relationship started out house to house, then she got her place renovated and moved into my place, which took about 18 months. Us, two dogs and housemate all living together.

Her reno got completed, and we moved into her nice house about a year ago. (Rich parents)

It has all been going well, but my dog is a bigger rescue (ridgeback/staffy x) and has been causing increasing strain. She has social anxiety as she was beaten as a puppy, barks at guests which can be scary, is overly attached to me, keeps messing up the veggie garden, my partner can't walk her cause she has shown some aggression to other dogs and is too strong etc.

She has now asked me to get rid of the dog, and while I have told her she is more important to me, and I understand her position. I am struggling with it and feel like I am building some animosity about it despite my best efforts not to.

I know my dog sucks, but she got me through depression where I would have wouldn't be here without her. So I feel deeply bonded to her as an animal, and now I am struggling even to look my puppy in the face.

AITA, for wanting to keep my shit dog when my partner is fed up?

&#x200B;

Edit:  Should have included we are only at this point after putting in a lot of work and training.She is a really well-behaved dog when not under stress but carrying deep trauma and is very physically strong and imposing.

Barks at guests last only a few seconds until she gets a pat and is acknowledged but is still pretty over the top and not a great way for people to enter a room to.

Thanks for the ideas on management and training options though they are all appreciated.

2028,Everyone Sucks,"Ok so this morning after I got ready, I asked my mom for lunch money. We are low income so it was probably annoying for her. 

Anyways I made a joke about how I miss being on free lunch, since she didn’t apply this year, and she responded with a slightly angry “yeah well we don’t have that now” or something along the lines of that. I replied with “why are you talking like you’re mad?” Because I didn’t understand why she would be mad. She responded with a “well I’m just being realistic.” And I left the room.

4989,No A-holes here,"My grandmother passed late June, but we didn’t have her service until this past weekend. She was baptist and attended church near her house, which is where we had the service, officiated by the current head pastor there. 

The pastor talked about my grandmother maybe 30% of the time, and the rest of the time he preached a fire-and-brimstone, “gods way is the only way, accept him or go to hell” sermon, shouting a lot of the time. I felt this was entirely inappropriate, it was my grandmother’s memorial service, and this man, who didn’t even know her well, used her death as a way to preach his opinion to her grieving family. A lot of my family isn’t even Christian, they’re Jehovah’s Witnesses, so he told them repeatedly they’re going to burn in Hell with Satan while they cried over their dead relative.

12751,Everyone Sucks,"Backstory: I come from a middle class family, we're not rich, but they're able to support me through my degree. On the other hand, my roommate comes from a terribly abusive family, receives no financial support and has basically been financially independent since she was 16. We used to be best friends, until we had a falling out over her thinking I was trying to steal her boyfriend (which is a whole other story, but trust me when I say, I've been with my own boyfriend for 5 years and had no interest in her man, she let her own insecurities got the better of her and ruin what was an excellent friendship). 

&#x200B;

Present Day: After our falling out, my roommate began to be really abusive: she poured hair dye in my shampoo, burned a bunch of my school notes, went to our professor to try and kick me out of a group project we were in for claiming I hadn't done any work (when I had the evidence to prove I did) and would constantly yell and threaten me. What really bothered me though was that I leant her a really expensive curling iron that was around $200 and she refused to give it back despite me asking multiple times for it. Around the 4th time I asked her to return it, I found it broken outside my door. I was furious, but calmly asked her to pay me back for it.

Not enough to crate them the entirety of the day while we're at work. They're alone from 8am to 3pm.

But that isn't the issue. The issue is sometimes they *do* make a mess and I get to hear all about it like I took a shit on the floor myself.

Example, today my husband calls me and tells me they both had pooped on the floor. I told him I walked them this morning (which I did) and again at 11 on my lunch break (which I did) and neither of them squeezed anything out. He sat on the phone for several seconds in silence.

7107,No A-holes here,"Throwaway for anonymity.

My parents passed away recently from a car crash (they were quite elderly). My sister and I are in our 30s, and the costs of two funerals is quite a lot of money for us. Because of such, our family lawyer friend who wrote our parents' will, is trying to expedite the execution of their will to pay for the funeral.


It turns out my parents left everything to my sister (around $2m), and gave me $50k cash. This is likely due to them not approving of who I married (she's a different race), but I was still shocked to hear how little they cared about me anymore, especially since when they were alive, they treated my sister and I as if we were equally loved. The worst part of it is, from what I know about law, they only left me the 50k so that I wouldn't be able to sue to my sister for half of the assets. The fact that they thought I'd even do that is what hurts more than anything. 

The will hasn't been executed yet and it may take a while, so my sister wants to plan the funeral without the money and pay off the debts later. She's asked to come over so we could plan the funeral and costs, and I told her no. I don't want to have anything to do with my parents funeral, whether it's helping pay for it or helping plan it. My sister seems very stressed, and I feel had about not helping, but every time I think of my parents now I get angry and upset.

1163,Asshole,"My relationship with my parents was strained. Out of high school I was threatened that if I didn't attend uni immediately (no year off to work) and I didn't pick an approved study (STEM, law, business) they'd give my education savings to my sibling. I begrudgingly chose a major that they approved. There was a lot of other big issues, such as only being allowed one phone call a week, my door removed off the hinges, and my parents moving their bed so they can watch me while I'm doing homework and sleeping. There's a ton to unpack there but basically I wasn't treated like an adult.  


Later I met someone and started dating. This didn't fit their values and they thought it'd risk my education. After a few big arguments they cut off my funding and I was told I had to move out. Part of me thinks I should have dropped out but I wanted to see it through to the end. I moved in with my partner and took on substantial student loans. I also worked during uni, but still took on a few tens of thousands of dollars in loans.  


I got a dream job after graduating but my area has high unemployment and I was laid off shortly after as part of mass layoffs. I went on EI and have been struggling to find a job; the story is always the same: I'm fighting with thousands of people with decades of experience. My employment insurance runs out next week, and my financial situation is abysmal.  


About a decade ago, my father was permanently disabled by a workplace accident. He fell into a few legal grey areas. Regular disability insurance refused to pay and he went without income while fighting a number of lawsuits. He also lost his pension; my parents financial situation has been abysmal too.  


Recently my father won a major milestone in his lawsuits. He's getting a small pension now but not enough to cover monthly expenses. The judgement includes me getting retroactive payments from the government to pay for my uni, as I should have been receiving benefits for him being disabled while going to uni. Its a hefty sum; equal to just under my entire debt. Since my parents aren't receiving any lump sum from their judgement they are claiming that they're ""entitled"" to this money.  


Despite this, I want to help them. My childhood up until I started university was privileged even after my father was injured. Its still true that they ultimately paid for half my education. If they pay off their mortgage, which it'd help them do, they'll no longer have a negative income. They've promised that if I give them the money they'll help me with my student loans down the road.  


My GF says that if I give my parents the money, I'm choosing their future over ours and that I would be an asshole. Her mother is trying to push my GF to break up with me if I do it, but my GF is leaning toward being a bit more understanding.

Back a while ago, when I was around 23/24, I really was not enjoying my chosen career. I felt like I was a terrible fit for the position and I was severely depressed. On the other hand, I’ve always enjoyed art, especially digital art, and I was tossing around the idea of going to art school. My parents were extremely non-supportive, telling me that I should stick to my chosen career path and that art school would be a poor choice. I talked to my sister about it, as well. She said that it was unrealistic, like my parents did. (Though, admittedly, she did tell me that I should do it if I really wanted to.) She suggested that I give my chosen career a choice for a little while longer, see how it felt, and then maybe try art school. I kept on trucking with my career and now I can say I’m very, very happy with my decision.

Fast forward to now. My sister has been doing her chosen career path, non-health field-related, for a few years. Recently, she came up to me and told me that she’s been feeling dissatisfied with her current position and wants to pursue her “dream” of going to medical school. She was talking about all her plans for getting ready for medical school, etc etc. I told her, just like the advice she gave me, that she should stick out her current position and that going to medical school was unrealistic with her age and her chosen field. I mean, after all, if I could stick out my current career, so can she. She got MAD, saying that she’s always been supportive of what I wanted and dreamed of. Clearly not the case, even if the advice she gave was a good!

Our parents are supportive of her plan, obviously because they think that medicine is more “prestigious” and “worthwhile” than art. My mother chastises me, saying that I should be more supportive of her, and I told her that I was being supportive, just as my sister has been supportive of me.

She wouldn't let me get to a checkpoint. You see, it's very difficult to play while someone is kissing your neck/trying to bite you. I kept telling her give me, like, two more minutes, but I don't know what porno she just finished watching to *this* needy. Whatever, I blew the game and was being rather rough with her when her mom called. She got off me mid kiss to go answer the phone, and basically her mom said food was ready, come over right now etc. We were mildly annoyed as we put our clothes back on, but we didn't start fucking so no harm no foul.

Fast forward to when we're eating dinner, I'm still mildly annoyed we didn't get to start, and I decide to return the favor of her distracting me by pinching her thigh when her parents aren't paying attention. Shes into it, don't worry. We finished eating and her mom takes everyone's plates and her dad went to the living to watch some desi movie, idk. So while everyone's back is turned she thinks it's a good idea to try to slip her hand up my shirt. We're both playing, keep in mind. I push her hand and her elbow bumps into the table while I say ""God, you're *such* a whore."" I guess it was louder than intended because both of her parents heads *snap* towards me.

I almost had a heart attack, I swear.

We were having fun, but from her parents perspective, all they hear is *painful thump* you're such a whore!

Yeah, I understand why they kicked me out.

Her dad yelled at me, how dare I call his daughter that in *his* house. Her mom was cursing me in her native language, and though I didn't understand I knew enough curse words to know she was *mad*.

My fiancé was telling them to calm down but her parents were not having it. Her parents are brown, we can't just explain to them that she likes being called a whore, she'll call us crazy. Her dad yelled at me to gtfo, I didn't wanna piss him off more so I left and she stayed and later told me she was trying to make up some scenario on that spot to why that would be acceptable but her parents weren't having it.

I went ""home"" and I get like 7 text messages from my fiancé saying that I'm an idiot, why would I do that *in front* of her parents, her mom is gossiping to all of her sisters etc. I didn't feel bad then because I knew we were fine but it's the next day and her parents aren't letting her see me and I feel bad now. I didn't mean for them to hear but they did and they're furious with me. I tried to apologize but I can't find a proper excuse as to why I called her a whore without exposing her or making me look abusive.

12483,Asshole,"I grew up from 10-21 years old with my mum's ex husband. He's always been a great guy to me, we were like really close friends since I became a teenager - he took me on holidays with him, taught me how to scuba dive, landed me my first job, taught me some valuable life lessons and was just all-round a fantastic figure to have close to me while growing up, we had so much fun together.

Unfortunately he and my mother fell out pretty bad about 3 years ago due to their marriage just not functioning properly anymore. In all fairness he didn't behave that well to my mother towards the end of their marriage - he'd go out with his friends more than being with her, drank a lot (possibly doing coke too but that's a theory of mine), barely showed up at home for dinner and other stuff which I'm not 100% aware of since I was in another country at the time (university, was back home maybe once every three or four months).

The biggest thing I guess that makes my mother not want to have him around is that during the divorce case , the judge decided my mum should pay him 1,500€ a month for two years to him due to a loan he gave her when they were married. My mum's problem with that is that while they were married she was paying for large part of everything, bills, the house was hers, a lot of the holidays, etc. That really pissed her off.

Now it's my birthday in a week and I really wanna invite him over but my mum said that's out of the discussion, she doesn't want him at the party and has forbidden me to invite him, but I'm thinking of doing it regardless because I think once he shows up she'll be fine with it.

1611,Not the A-hole,"I (F22) was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease a little over a year ago. Since then I have been stable with minimum medication for the last 5 months, my doctor says its ""remission.” I have also been struggling with mild-moderate acne for the past five years, and after exhausting all my options I made the decision to go on accutane. My sister (29) and I are very close, she lives far away so we text a lot. We are both health nuts, I hate that I have to take meds. The end goal is no meds but I am still processing the fact that I have the disease and I accept the meds because it’s keeping It from spreading to my organs while I devise a strategy to get off them.

My sister is also struggling with acne, and when I mentioned I was thinking about going on accutane she said that I dont need more meds and there are better, natural ways to fix acne. I then said I’ve thought about it a lot and I feel this is the best option, and it was dropped. All was well until last night, my sis is an affiliate and sells is these cumin pills that help with joint pain, which is a symptom of my disease. She had sent me some refills, and I texted her to thank her. She said welcome, and went on to say that she was talking to her facial gal and she was telling her about how harmful accutane can be for long term health, and that all acne stems from gut health and suggested I take a food allergy test to see whats causing it, especially with all the medication I am already taking. (she doesn’t know what or how much I'm taking, shes just assuming I'm taking a lot)

Basically I said “thanks, I appreciate the advice but I know whats best for my health, I’m good :)” she had said ""okay."" and then sent another text later saying ""so I can send you the free curcumin pills but you wont take advice from healthcare professionals that I talk too? okay \*thumbs up\* I found your response very passive aggressive and I dont appreciate it. Goodnight"" I told her I could send the pills back if she wanted, and she said they were $150 pills, and I could e transfer her the money for them. I said I would send the pills back, not send the money though. We started arguing because she said I wasn’t grateful for her help and advice, and that I take her for granted/will regret treating her this way. I did get pretty sassy at the end of it and told her I felt like the bis sis sometimes, and that she was rude/defensive when I didn’t engage in her advice, and that if I want advice I will ask for it.

This went back and forth and ended with me saying, me not wanting to talk about this has nothing to do with her, but with me as my health is a sensitive topic. I said  I appreciate the advice but not all advice is wanted, and please don't force advice on my or make me feel guilty about taking accutane. I said I was sorry we fought, loved her tons but talking to her isnt serving me right now. She hasnt responded.

20839,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend and I have lived together for over a year and we had birth control failure (broken condom) that resulted in me getting pregnant just a few months into the relationship.

The entire time I was pregnant I worked full time and was getting put on bedrest quite a bit. He would not keep a job. He would not get along with management, they didn’t like him, they were picking on him, they wanted him to work longer hours or whatever excuse he could find to quit. 

He’s also a chain smoker and always needing cigarettes or being very angry and rude when he didn’t have them. Well my son was born early and he needed to be in the NICU. I figured since my bf didn’t have a job that he would stay at the hospital with me.(2 1/2 hours away from our house) he then announced he got a new job and I could stay with the baby and he was going home (our son was given a 50:50 chance to even come home) 

I was angry but I let him go hoping he was going to straighten up. Fast forward and our son is home and on oxygen and Of course my boyfriend isn’t working again and I’m pulling doubles. I make enough with my paychecks to pay the bills but I’ve been hiding my tip money in a wax candle burner it’s broken so it doesn’t turn on. I’ve saved quite a bit because if I don’t hide it then he takes it to buy pack after pack of cigarettes. 

I know it’s dishonest but it’s the only extra money I have. Well he was messing around and hit the corner shelf where I keep the cash and it fell on the floor and money spilled out. He scolded me for hiding money from him and that he was suffering from nicotine withdrawal and that he couldn’t believe how selfish I was and that I was a liar and all this other stuff. AITA?

Edit to add: I have stayed with him despite his actions because my very religious family was very upset that I got pregnant out of wed lock and I’m afraid that if I leave him that they will shun me even more for being a single parent.

Edit to say: he doesn’t smoke in the house around the baby. He has a machine that is plugged into the wall that creates oxygen from the surrounding air so he has to sleep and stay right beside that machine at all times so he goes outside to smoke. Also he takes care of our son during the day. He seems well cared for. Putting into childcare isn’t an option because non of the childcare centers will take him because of his oxygen dependency and the ones who will are so expensive that my whole paycheck would barely cover the cost. 
I feel like I’m drowning sometimes, Just barely making it above water.

My brothers and I found out that our dad (who recently passed away) left us with documents, notes and diaries that contain over 300 years of our family history, dating back to 1713. He wanted us to go public with everything but the choice has to be ours and all three of us have to be on board with it. There are 32 documents, 64 notes and 8 diaries along with other incomplete writings, personal items and photographs that contain over 300 years worth of information. All of it is extremely valuable in terms of history but it's also very tragic. 

There are documents, starting with a letter from 1788. that our ancestor wrote to (presumably) his son about 3 (possibly child) slaves he had traded and ending with the documents that our dad believed were written and intended for the 1850 census. It was a ''slave schedule'' of 14 people that only had their gender written down and approximate age for some of them who were the youngest. We have evidence that our ancestors owned 64 slaves between 1788. and possibly 1850.

Given that we don't have a solid timeline of slave ownership, we only have incomplete data from paper trails, the number is likely much higher than 64.
In his findings, our dad noted that based on the wealth timeline (how it changed over the decades) and property ownership of our family, that number could be well over 100 in the 1713. to 1865. period. My oldest brother is against us going public because of the political and racial climate today, he has two kids in college and he doesn't want them to become targets of misunderstanding or to be labeled and characterized as something they're not over their family history. My younger brother wants us to go public with this because he recognizes the historical value of these findings but more importantly, because it could possibly help the descendants of slaves trace their lineage and know their history.

I still don't know where I stand. I know that my decision is key because I can talk to my oldest brother and possibly change his mind about his decision, I just don't know if I want to do that. I feel like a hypocrite because I think of myself aa a fighter for human rights and equality and now that I actually have a chance at making things better, I'm hesitating. If we go public with this, if we donate everything we have, our names will forever be tied to this. I'm afraid I could lose my job. Based on our dad's findings, we are positive that there would be media coverage. There is valuable information that relates to 2 particularly known figures as well as political writings and details about other family names and companies.

The bus stop is about a one minute walk from our house, basically just around one street corner. The street corner itself isn’t an actual corner but a used car sales yard. Since this month, the owner has hired a bunch of guys. To be honest I’m not sure what they’re even doing, I once saw them power wash the yard and the cars, but usually when I’m passing by they seem to be goofing off and generally behaving like overgrown teenagers (like punching each other and making fart sounds and stuff) (yes I know I’m saying this as a teenager myself).


Then a few hours ago, my sister suddenly asked me to take the earlier bus with her from now on. For a moment I thought she was concerned about me being late for class, but turns out the point was that she wanted us to walk to the bus stop together. When I asked her why she told me that the guys at the car yard keep yelling sexual stuff at her every time she walks by. I started to laugh because I thought she was joking. Next thing I know she bursts into tears and starts crying her eyes out. That really shocked me, of course didn’t want to make her cry and promised her I’d be walking to the bus stop with her.

17158,Not the A-hole,"To keep things vague because there's a high change some of you here may recognize me if you live in my county, but I've worked part-time as a high school track & field coach (esp with the women's teams). I've worked there for about 7 years now and have a great record of bringing the girls teams to regionals and even state every year. I'm essentially the only competent coach left in the school system due to budget cuts in the past 5 years. My wife and I retired roughly 10 years ago and we've got a good nest egg so salary has never been a big deal for me with this job. I'm just happy to coach and see new kids win awards, scholarships, college acceptances based on what I've helped them accomplish.

&#x200B;

Anyways, a few months ago a big scandal broke out. One of the girls I coached (15 at the time) accused me of hitting on her. Basically what had happened was that she had her high school boyfriend saved in her phone under my name (first and last) because her parents were strict about dating. She somehow thought it would be better if they saw MY name texting her instead of some boy. Well, the parents obviously saw explicit messages at one point and put two and two together. I was suddenly under investigation and that's when the rumors started spreading like wildfire.

&#x200B;

The whole thing only took about a week to clear up in the end (the phone numbers didn't match after all) and the girl came clean pretty quickly too once the police started interviewing her. However by this time all of the parents had coalesced to have me ""investigated"" because in their words they couldn't take any risks and I had to understand being a father of 3 myself. I was heartbroken and humiliated. My wife was outraged and she's still angry now just thinking about it. We considered selling our house and moving cities. Even though my name was cleared several times over, the humiliation, the rumors, everything, still affects me I can't lie.

&#x200B;

So now the parents are back and they're begging me to stay. They said I'm the only coach with enough experience to bring their girls to championships and they've apologized nonstop. However, my wife and I are leaning towards moving for peace of mind. My wife is more resolute and she thinks good riddance, but honestly I feel torn up inside. I know I am doing a huge disservice to the school and the teams by leaving and I know the program has a high chance of being cut within the next 3 years if I leave and they're forced to pay more for another coach.

So, this was another incident back in high school. I was standing in the lunch line with this kid, Eric. Eric was your typical burnout, and we rarely if ever interacted. I only mention him being a burnout because he was known for the typical schtick of giving people a hard time for trying at anything. As I pay for my meal, Eric starts openly mocking me for having to pay $5 for my meal. Like legit ""haha, you have to pay for lunches! That's hilarious. I get my breakfast and lunch for free!"" Eric is part of the free/subsidized meal program at the school, as evidenced by how the lunch lady rings it up. He makes a few more jabs, and his friend Grant laughs along.


I'm getting tired of this and just want to eat my pizza in peace, so I ask him, ""Are you actually bragging about your family not having enough money to feed you? If that's supposed to make me feel bad, it doesn't."" 


A couple nearby kids started laughing at  him. Eric got mad, swore at me, then walked away. Two lunch ladies started yelling at me for being rude. Apparently Eric had never realized what the free/subisized meal program was and had just assumed he won some prize for free food. Turns out he was pretty devastated by this realization and was tearing up during his next class. I guess his family had done a good job hiding their financial situation from him.


The vice principal ended up casually talking to me about the issue, saying I wasn't in any trouble but that I should think about things from his point of view and be a little more understanding of other people's financial situations.

Anyway, the months leading up to the split my mom got a new job and she loves it.

The real kicker now is that they just got engaged, I didn't find out until my mom posted a photo of it on Facebook. She told everyone else about the engagement and how they are getting married next year except for me (even told the girl at the sushi place we go to before me).

It’s not that I’m afraid of commitment, but I don’t see the point of having the government involved in our relationship and making a big deal out of it to friends and family. That, and I don’t want any consequences for us splitting apart. 

So, when she proposed to me, I naturally declined, but I insisted that I really did love her and saw a future with her. We live together and do everything together already. She somehow got mad at me for that, saying that if I truly did then I wouldn’t have any problems with marriage and that I should stop being paranoid. She’s been being really cold to me as of late and has been saying that I emotionally hurt her, but it’s just that I really don’t want to be married. I still plan on being with her for as long as humanly possible, and that’s that.",135,46,0.82,AITA for not wanting to get married?,c546en,2019-06-25 06:57:02,NAH,1198,AITA
482,Asshole,"Hey all.

Some weeks ago I had to take my cat to a follow-up vet appointment to check on some pretty big scary surgery. 

Unfortunately my car wasn't working so I had to get a ride from an app similar to Uber. I'd done this before for an earlier vet appointment, so I thought it was no biggy. 

Firstly the driver was 15mins late, which was annoying but I acknowledge traffic is a factor beyond  control. When he finally shows up, he then refused to  let me in the car - because he's scared of animals. At this point the cat is in a solid plastic carrier with a towel over it, he can't see or be seen by the outside world.

At this point I'm going to be late for the appointment and get charged a cancellation fee (it's a specialist hospital, which was in the address so maybe should have been an indicator to the driver before accepting the ride). I tell the guy I'm really not impressed after trying to persuade him and he leaves. 

I manage to get a taxi last minute for a lot more money, but we get there with 2 mins to spare. I then call customer service to let them know about his refusal, and they say they'll feed it back. 


AITA fit reporting this guy and not giving a shit about his phobia..? I get that it's a legit issue but if it stops you from doing your job I'm less sympathetic.

2859,Asshole,"This happened on Thursday in a shopping mall. I was in a department store and an old man in his 80s was looking confused and rattled. I’m a man in my 30’s, just so you can get an idea. This old man kept dropping stuff and was looking around for someone. 

It was extremely noticeable he was distressed so I approached him and asked if he was ok. He said “I can’t find (name)” who was his wife. This is kind of the way the convo went. 

Him: She was just here, she doesn’t usually go far away from me. 

Me: Slow down. Who is (name)? Wife, daughter, granddaughter? I can’t help if you don’t provide more details. 

H: My wife! She had on a blue sweater and black pants. She is very short and fragile. 

M: do you know the last place you saw her?

H: (getting agitated) NO! Where is she?? I said where is she? 

M: Sir, please calm down. I don’t know who she is and am trying to help you, but I can’t help you with you yelling and screaming.

At this point he keeps dropping things and I pick them up. Conversation continues as we start pacing around the store. It’s almost empty, and no employees in sight. 

H: She forgets where she is, she needs to be found. 

M: Which is exactly what I am attempting to do. 

We find her on the other end of the store sitting on a chair which made it hard to see over the clothing racks. She barely speaks and seems tired or confused. 

M: Hi, your husband was looking for you. Are you okay?
(Him and her talking and him asking why she walked away). 

M: Sir, you really need to be more careful. She seems like she is very confused. Please don’t lose her again, you might not be as lucky. 

H: you don’t know my wife. 

M: I know her from seeing her looking dazed she is nearly helpless. Do a better job next time and try not to let her wander. As I said, you might not be lucky next time. 

He screams “that’s enough, shame on you” and walks away.

Me: nurse. Working 50ish hours a week in paediatric ICU. Cry at least once a week because that shit is hard. My salary pays our bills. All of them. 

Husband: 25M. Has a degree but isn't looking for a job. Works 2 days a week at the grocery store. Spends most of his time playing LoL. 

Btw all events here are in accordance with Covid Legislation. 

Today was supposed to be A Good Day. I had been begging my husband to swap his Saturday shift to literally anything else so that we could have days off together. We haven't had a weekend together since our wedding, 18mo ago. 

Today was supposed to be our first Saturday off together. We were going to go to an animal sanctuary.


He starts the day by going to breakfast. With his best mate. Leaving before I even wake up. I wake up around 9 and realise he is not home. Call. He says he's helping his mate set up some lights and that the weather is too rainy for the animal sanctuary anyway. 

He gets home at 1ish. Lies around. Plays some video games, promising we would cook dinner together tonight.

Leaves again at 5 to help the same mate with something else. 

I go grocery shopping. I don't drive because of medical issues, but I walk there and back in the rain. I get home, realise I've left my keys inside. Call husband, knowing he's 5min away. He says he will leave in a minute. I sit in the rain and the cold (southern hemisphere). 45 min later, I call again. He hasn't left yet. He finally agrees to come and let me in the house, so he drives up, presses the clicker to let me in the garage and leaves again. 

At 10, I I called to see where he is. His friend answers. Says he is driving out to do something an hour away. 

It's 10.30. I am going to bed. I have sent him a txt that I am upset and don't want to speak to him tonight and would rather he left me alone.

21203,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory sorry because I’m on mobile. 
So I’m (19F) an incoming college freshman amongst this COVID mess. Because of COVID, my school is offering to let us stay home and go completely online for the first semester, and receive a refund for room and board and our meal plans. The school I’m going to is my dream school, and it happened to be on the pricey side, so I worked my ass off and got several scholarships to get a full ride. 

Some of these scholarships are from external organizations, meaning that if I have everything covered without their help, it goes in my pockets. I’m thinking about staying home this semester because if I had that money refunded, I wouldn’t need the other scholarships to help cover the cost, so they would be written as checks directly to me. 

As I was discussing this with my mom, she said “That would be lovely if we could get that money back, because then I could use some of it to buy your brother a car!” This kinda surprised me, because none of the money that is going towards this semester came from my parents. I worked to make sure they wouldn’t have to pay anything. After this discussion, she brought up my brothers car a few more times. 

So WIBTA if I asked my mom to leave all of the scholarship money to me so i could put half in savings and use the other half on important things I have coming in the future (i.e. my cats surgery bill, grad school, food)? 

The major thing that’s stopping me from saying anything is that two years ago, we were in a way better financial situation, so my parents were able to buy me a new car. Now, the only parent who had a job has lost it and we aren’t sure how we’ll get the money to buy my brother a car. 

I understand if you guys think that I would be pulling an asshole move and I already feel guilty, I just need the money. 

Note: My brother is 16, we have a car that will be his if we can’t afford to buy him one, and the scholarship money that I could get back would end up totaling about 5K.

Edit: Thank you all so much for your concern and helpful comments thus far. I’m now wondering if I should just go to school to avoid this mess and do a work study instead.

Edit 2: Don’t think it matters, but i just realized we bought the car three years ago, not two. we purchased it in 2017!",206,1007,0.96,WIBTA if i told my mom I wanted to keep my scholarship money instead of using it to buy my brother a car?,i1w4ru,2020-08-01 17:37:32,NTA,2285,WIBTA
7019,Asshole,"Alright, so the party was yesterday.

He works for a tech startup, it's doing well and has around 80 employees. It's a very informal place, they've got beer on tap in the office, it's got a lot of female employees. Very liberal place.

So the party was also a very informal event, they wanted a big bash for raising their Series B funding, so they hired a DJ, rented out an awsome venue, lots and lots of alcohol.

They were also told to bring friends, as many as they liked.

&#x200B;

Anyway, from everything they described, it seemed like it was going to be wild. So I asked my husband, if I could sort of wear a similar outfit to what I usually wear at festivals.

It's a very cheeky bikini bottom, bikini top, fishnet jeweled top, hat, colored sunglasses, stockings. Very cool and not too inappropriate since I figured a big party that's expecting \~500 people under 35,with one of the biggest DJ's, would have many women dressed like this.

&#x200B;

Apparently, though the dress code stated beachwear, most people were in casual clothes and I was one of maybe 30-50 women baring midriff, and the only one showing booty. My husband didn't mind and was proud, introduced to me to everyone, including his boss etc.

&#x200B;

However, today he got an email from lady in HR saying, while they applaud my confidence, they'd rather I tone it down at a company-sponsored event where the media and investors were.

What probably made it worse for him and well me, was that my husband is best friends with the company's CTO and we hung out with him all evening and night. However, many many investors and other important folks came to meet with him and would have seen me hanging out in their group.

&#x200B;

My husband, isn't feeling bad, he's handling it well. He replied, saying that his wife (me) is accustomed to wearing this attire at pool parties and was sort of led to believe (by him) that was going to be a big summer bash given the DJ, venue and hype. He apologized and said he'd rather she tell him upfront so that I could have gone home to change or cover up with something so that it would have limited any embarrassment.

&#x200B;

It was my choice to wear this, and I do feel awful, but I don't think I was wrong or an asshole to wear what I did. They told everyone bring friends, it's going to wet and wild etc. It's a startup not a Fortune 500 company.

13114,Asshole,"I am pretty sure that I'm the asshole here, but wanted verification.   Honestly, I'm not sure I'm going to change it though because there aren't too many things he will eat. 

So when S (son) was 8, his favorite food was steak, and filets being his favorite cut.  He literally asked me daily for steak.   One day, he came home saying he didn't want to eat meat any more because he didn't want to hurt animals.   I immediately asked him, what about steak?  He said, ""I'll probably just eat it once a month.""  Thinking it's just a phase, and I want to honor his fledgling belief systems, I go with it. 

So the month went by... he isn't less picky about vegetables, and is essentially a carb/cheese iterian.  I'm supplementing with vitamins and veggie/ fruit smoothies.  I ask him if he's ready for his monthly steak.   He says no. 

So, fast forward to middle school and high school years and he discovers that he loves Mexican food.  Initially cheese enchiladas and progressing to 
rice/ refried bean/ cheese burritos.   

Awesome. There's protein in them beans. 

He is totally clueless that traditional refried beans are made with lard (I just buy the 16 pack at Costco/ Sam's.)  He eats probably 16 burritos a week.  (He's a teenager, it's ridiculous.)

AITA that I've never told him that refried beans, practically anywhere, aren't strictly vegetarian?   And I actively don't buy the vegetarian refried beans because well more expensive, and jeezus, I'm already catering to him anyway. 

I've been cooking two meals for almost ten years, and finally he's able to make his own food.   

I'm pretty sure IATA, but wanted verification.   Most of my friends/ family think I was an idiot for even entertaining the vegetarianism in the first place, especially because he won't eat vegetables.

EDIT: Kid is 17 and I only realized that there was a vegetarian refried bean option like two years ago.

EDIT 2: I just told the kid.   He literally said that he knew already but he'd decided that it wasn't ""enough.""  As in, it wasn't enough like eating meat to make him stop eating refried beans at restaurants, etc.  He said, he just can't chew meat, that grosses him out. Then he said,  it's my favorite source of protein, so yeah, I'm good. 

EDIT 3: I just asked him how long he has known, and he said at least a few years.   He told me that he'd googled vegetarian options at Mexican restaurants when he was 14 and realized that refried beans weren't vegetarian.  But figured that it wasn't a big enough deal to stop eating his favorite Mexican food.   

EDIT 4:  Here's where IA(truly)TA. He's been checking out his protein/fat/carb ratios for a few years, changing his diet to increase muscle mass and gain weight.   He's known this whole time about eating non veggie refried beans.   IATA, totally, for not believing my kid would be on top of it.

We said ""should have seat selected then, no"".

She explained that this is her connecting flight via codeshare and she could only seat select on the main legs of her flight with the airline operating them, but not this ticket. (Frankfurt to Singapore and then Singapore to somewhere in Australia).

We told her ""too bad"".

We didn't want to move seats. We were disappointed someone was put in the middle but I wanted the window, mate wanted the aisle.

Instead of accepting this, she started typing something on her phone and flagged down a flight attendant and passed them the phone. I guess she complained in that way instead of having the guts to do it so we could hear.

Flight attendant then said we had to move so she was not sitting in the middle.

My mate is claustrophobic and really likes the aisle, I didn't want to move from window either because I like looking out during landing.

We were out with family + friends for my MILS 60th birthday and there were ceviche tacos served which I’ve never had before and thought they tasted exquisite. My wife was next t me and I told her to try some. She said eww, no it’s fish, but I scooped up some and the assorted garnishes and told her to open up. She started laughing and said ‘seriously, no I don’t want it!’ But I held it there and she rolled her eyes but smiled and ate it. 

Just to add context, I would NEVER ever press it if I knew from her body language she was on a solid no about something but we do this to each other all the time and I know she eats fish so it’s not like I was making her eat an ingredient she hates. 

She visibly liked it and said oh, give me some more. I made her up a little taco and placed it on her plate, by which point her best friend from childhood (don’t really know her prior to this) who was sat opposite said ‘I can’t believe you let him force you into that, it’s disgusting’.

I wasn’t at first what I was going to do or how my boyfriend would take it so I took a few days to think things over and keep discussing it with my family.  

I’ve decided to keep it.  I told my boyfriend and he was actually pretty great about it.  He asked when should we tell our families about it and I told him that I already told mine.  He was annoyed that I went to them first and waited a few days to decide without him and only tell him after the fact.  He said that we should have decided together as this is will be our child and not mine alone.  I can see his point, but ultimately it’s my choice and I don’t feel in the wrong about talking to my family about it.  Especially considering they are both mothers themselves.  

Edit. Just to clarify a couple things cause I keep getting basically the same response in my inbox.  My mother and sister had no more choice in the matter than he did.   I went to them for support and advice as they have both been there, but it was my choice.  

I didn’t tell him first because due to our age and length of the relationship I honestly thought he’d want me to terminate the pregnancy and I wanted few day to wrap my head around the situation before taking that on.  Turns out that wasn’t the case though.

We get along really well, I like her kids, she likes mine; awesome. This morning, though, has brought up a conflict of interest, and I need to know if I’m an asshole. 

Sally was staying the night with her friend, Mary, last night. Apparently, Mary is installing some new cabinets with a new sink. I am a journeyman plumber, and am quite familiar with how the install should go. Sally sent me a text with some pictures of the cabinet, asking, “Would you be interested in making some more money?”

Now, here’s where the conflict comes in. I don’t like side work. I work 40 hours a week, doing this kind of stuff all the time. I make a good amount of money. I have an attitude of trying not to bring my job home with me. I’m not lazy, I’m willing to help out where I can, BUT, I just don’t want to do my job when I’m not working. I feel like there’s plenty of people out there like me. Sally is a very outgoing woman. She works two jobs, one of which is waitressing, which requires you to be pretty bubbly, which she is. She also works 7 days a week. Sally is the type of girl who wants to help anyone she can, anyway she can. She would do anything, even if she has worked all day. I think it’s a great trait, and it’s something that I would like to work towards. She says she’s not mad, but a little upset that I didn’t want to help out. She also said that we may have a different outlook on things and that she can see it as a red flag.

not too long before i met him (let's call him D), i met a man (who i will call A) on tinder. we have sex every now and then (maybe once every two months). he texts me if he wants to meet up, we hook up, we go on with our lives. A is not interested in a relationship with anyone and i am not interested in him beyond the sex we have.

my friends hear about D all the time. they have never heard about A because it's not a big deal to me. about a week ago, i went to pick up something i had left at my friend's house. i casually mentioned i was stopping by but not trying to hang out because i had somewhere to be after. this friend always needs to know 110% of everything so i ended up having to explain the existence of A. she was floored because not only did she not know i was hooking up with someone for a year, but also because she'd heard so much about D.

this friend texted our group chat about A and i had to explain to our other friends who A was. no one was surprised but one of them made the observation that i want D to commit to me yet i was sleeping with A.

D is very important to me. he is my best friend. however, i feel like since D doesn't want to be committed that i am free to date or have sex with whoever i want. A doesn't mean anything to me. if D wanted a relationship right now, i wouldn't talk to or do anything with A ever again. i had never had a problem with this line of thinking until a friend pointed it out and now i kinda feel like an asshole.

19217,No A-holes here,"I (34f) met my husband while I was doing an exchange semester in Australia when I was 20. We later got married and I moved to Australia permanently. We have two kids 6f and 4f and I'm 4 months pregnant. 

My husband passed away 3 months ago. It was and still is horrible. With my husband not being here anymore I want to move back to my home country. I think it will be good for my kids because the education system over there is heaps better but the main reason is that I need my family. My 4 year old doesn't really have an opinion on it, my 6 year old is excited because my parents have horses.

Here in Australia, my husband's parents look after our kids Monday to Friday as my husband and I both had full time jobs. So, obviously they are close. Mil and FIL are very attached to the kids and love being grandparents. 

Last weekend I broke the news to them. I didn't expect them to be happy but I was hoping they'd understand. They didn't. It was ugly. They asked me how dare I taking away their grandchildren after they lost their only son. They said my husband would be disappointed and he'd want his children to grow up in Australia. I had to leave because I couldn't handle the situation.

I feel guilty because my husband did want to stay in Australia but mainly because that's where we settled. I don't think he'd be disappointed. I think he'd understand. But I feel so guilty but also angry? I feel like it was cruel of mil and FIL to say what they said.

I was still in a bit of shock from what happened, and I impulsively texted her out of the blue saying ""need you to draft a letter for me for good character. Need it by Friday thanks so much"" and she responded with ""you need to ask before you demand something of someone."" 

I immediately apologized with ""my bad I'm sorry. I still think you're the goat."" She agreed to write the letter, but kept on saying ""I'll write your letter today"" or ""I have an exam today/tomorrow but afterwards I'll write it."" She did this multiple times. She slowly stopped communicating, and the letter ended up never being written. She continued to post on all social media of her going out to bars/parties while not communicating with me whatsoever.

Eventually I reached out to one of our mutual friends to see what was going on. The mutual friend said that I never ""asked nor apologized correctly"" to the close friend. 

I ended up texting the close friend, saying ""I’m not mad but I’m pretty disappointed. I don’t mean to sound like a parent, but you really let me down with this letter.

19037,Not the A-hole,"I lost my first wife 10 years ago to cancer. My now wife and I married in 2015 and we’ve become a big blended family a little like the Brady Bunch. I have two kids and she has two kids.

Our kids are all roughly around the same ages as well (12-17) but my step daughter/son attend school living with their dad and usually will spend summers and winters with us, with more holidays in between.

The issue: my ex in-laws (late wife’s parents) are very close to my kids so they’ve been inviting my daughters to spend summers with them in Europe (they live in London). My daughters really love this since it makes them feel closer to their mum’s heritage and they get to travel a LOT in the meantime. My in laws are very well off and will spend parts of the summer taking the girls skiing or exploring exotic locales all across Europe and even Asia.

Now my wife is feeling very annoyed at how her kids are feeling as a result. She says that while we’re supposed to be one big family, my kids are obviously being given more opportunities to succeed in life. By traveling, learning new cultures and languages, and getting elite summer internships (my oldest was an intern at the ICJ in The Hague last summer by her grandad’s connections), my wife is unsettled at the gaps between my kids and her kids. 

I honestly don’t know how to solve this. My in laws are VERY wealthy to the point I don’t think I’ll ever be able to match their level of power/money. They will always be able to provide for their grandkids in ways my step kids won’t have. My wife wants me to put “limits” on these kinds of gifts to promote equality, but I also feel like this would be unfair for my daughters, who love their grandparents and are blossoming in their summers there. 

I had a heart to heart with my step kids recently and they expressed similar views, that it’s not “fair” my daughters get the privileges they do. I’ve been trying to spend more quality time with them and taking them on special summer vacations that’s the best we can afford, but that’s still a far cry from French chateaus and Italian villas.

4842,No A-holes here,"My mother has never had a real relationship with my father and I have seen him twice. At least that I can remember of. I love my mother more than anything and there is no bias involved towards my sister. I wanted my mother to find a good man she loves and when she did I encouraged her to get a child with him.

I was 20 when my sister was born. Her father sadly died few years after that and I was super glad that my mother still had my sister because I couldnt be there for her as much as I wanted to.

Now I never had a ""real"" relationship with my sister. I live rather far away so I just visit a few times a year, send gifts on special occasions etc.
I think that's why I dont really feel anything towards her. I wish her all the best and wouldn't ever wrong her, but I dont love her. I probably dont even like her. My mother on the other hand really, really wants us to have this amazing bond of big sister-little sister that love each other and so on. I feel terrible because I simply dont feel anything. I am closer in age to my mother than I am to my sister. I simply cant see how with this age gap and distance we can have a dream relationship. But I never said anything to my mother and always act like I love my sister and would do anything for her.

But I really want to spend time with my mother alone. My sister is 6 now, she is very social and doesnt really have an issue with staying with relatives or a baby sitter besides not having my moms attention. Still the only time we spent just the two of us when I visited is when she was asleep.

Now I got invited to a ceremony for top 500 apprentices in our region where I'll get a certificate and it's generally to honor the best of this year. I can bring two guests, so I decided to invite my mother and my bf. At first my mother was looking for someone to babysit my sister, but then she got this ""amazing"" idea that she can just give my sister a sick note for school (she is 6) and take her to the event as well since ""children surely dont count towards te 2 guests per person limit"". I really dont want my sister to be there. She is a kid and she doesnt know how to behave properly and needs all the attention there is. It's not her fault, but I want this to be about me for once and not about ""Look what your sister accomplished"".

Also I am moving to a new flat soon and my mother offered to help me, but now she also wants to have my sister there even though we will be working on the flat all the time and I really dont see how painting and taking care of a child so that she doesnt do anything bad with said paint, glue etc is a good idea.

I feel like an asshole that I dont want to have my sister at the ceremony and think about declining the invitation, look for an excuse for my mother and not going alltogether.

5575,Not the A-hole,"You may have seen a post on this sub about a woman being told not shaving her legs was unhygenic. This is actually related to that. First, some background:

I (18M) have been with my GF (18F) for over two years.

I'm a pretty serious competitive swimmer, so I started shaving my legs about a year ago. GF told me that she liked how my legs felt during sex, so I kept shaving them and moved on to basically my entire body (arms, legs, armpits, genitals, etc.)

We're both active Redditors, and few days ago, my GF saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ct8w0a/aita_for_not_shaving_my_legs_for_work/) about a woman being asked by her boss to shave her legs for work. She thought that was ridiculous (I did too) and told me that she was going to stop shaving to ""protest this sexist bullshit"" and ""help get rid of the expectation that women need to shave.""

I must admit, I was kind of annoyed by this. I thought her reasoning was terrible (and, let's be honest, I much prefer the feeling of shaved skin on shaved skin). I wouldn't have any problem with this if she, say, thought it was too much work (that shit takes a long time). I just didn't want to support her pointless ""protest.""

We went back and forth for a few minutes, and it ended with me telling her that I'd stop shaving down as a protest against stupid arguments. Swimming's in the off-season right now, so it's not going to affect my performance

She hasn't spoken to me in over a day. I also haven't shaved in over a day.

12348,Not the A-hole,"So my husband and I were stuck in an airport for 15 hours yesterday due to multiple flights to our destination being delayed and cancelled, so we hung out at a lot of different charging stations. 





This lady had her phone on top of someone else’s phone in her group on the charging station. Apparently she had set an alarm thing on her phone to go off if someone moves it because she left it unattended on the charging station. 





When we got to the charging station at our terminal the alarm was going off already and apparently the lady had walked away to do something and someone else in her group was holding it and the alarm was just constantly going off and sounded like a car alarm. Me and my husband were trying to figure out what was making this noise. 






So when she comes back from the bathroom, she’s yelling at her husband “wtf why is my phone going off?! Who touched it?!?!” 





So she looks over at me and my husband with the nastiest face assuming we fucked with her phone, which we did not. I do not care to mess with other people’s stuff. She was just yelling and going on and on about someone touching her phone, very loudly and angrily. For a good solid 10 minutes, constantly bitching. 





Her husband tells her someone bumped it while trying to get their phone plugged in to this station. And she just gets even madder still yelling about people trying to take her shit, which nobody did. 





So she comes to the station, moves other people’s shit around to get her phone plugged back in and she puts that damn car alarm trigger back on it, so if it moves, it goes off very loudly. 





When it’s time to start boarding she’s waiting at the desk, even though she was in the last boarding group. She was in such a hurry to try to cut every other boarding group, I guess she forgot about her heavily secured phone on the charging station. 





Her husband tells her, this isn’t our group you can’t board and she just shrugs her shoulders and stays in the line. My husband and I are still by the charging station because our boarding group was next to last. I unplug my phone and notice hers is still plugged in. She’s near the front of the line at this point. 






So I’m not touching that thing to make it go off very loudly again and have her accuse me of stealing her shit, yet again, just to take it to her and line cutting husband.

20450,Not the A-hole,"My sister, let's call her Billie, is a bit of a hypochondriac. Whenever she sneezes or her eyes water a little bit, she claims to have ""severe hay fever."" I have severe hay fever that I take medication for, and she does not show the symptoms and does nothing to treat it. 

Another example is that she'll experience something as innane as a headache she'll Google what the cause could be and usually asks me if I think she might have a tumour. I usually tell her to just drink some water. Pretty standard stuff. This is basically as far as it went during our childhood. 

The thing is, this doesn't seem to be anxiety based because the moment it's just us two all of her health complaints disappear. She posts about them on her SC story and makes a big fuss about wanting gluten free options in restaurants in front of our friends and then eats sandwiches at home, her hay fever disappears the moment she's outside in a grassy area with only me, etc. 

Recently, her I guess you could call it attention seeking has taken on a new development. A while ago she started claiming to suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome. She actually went to the doctors about it, and then another doctor, and another doctor after that, but none of them gave her a diagnosis because she's perfectly healthy. She also claimed to suffer from lupus, multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia. She would post about these conditions on Instagram and Snapchat and consistently complained about symptoms without actually showing any of them, and again, every doctor she went to wouldn't diagnose her with any of the above conditions. 

This story comes in because of the whole corona virus epidemic. She called me practically the middle of the night back in March and started ranting about how she's so worried she'll get it because she has ""so many underlying conditions and severe disabilities"" and that they put her ""at severe risk"" and how she could die. At this point I had just about enough of her bullshit. I know plenty of people who are actually at risk and this just seemed disrespectful.

So I told her point blank ""You don't have a real disability Billie. Stop your fucking attention whoring, you are so self centred that you even have to make an entire epidemic all about you. If you're ever unfortunate enough to suffer from anything you keep lying about you'll see that it's not some fun personality quirk. Go to hell.""

She hasn't spoken to me since that interaction and I honestly don't think I did anything wrong. However, our parents are siding with her and very pissed off at me for it, because they completely believe that she is in fact disabled. Everyone around her thinks she's disabled. I feel like I'm going crazy because it seems so obvious to me that she's not, she has NO diagnosis and her ""symptoms"" disappear the moment it's convenient.

5980,Asshole,"Using an alt because I don't want any inkling of my own personal beliefs (which can probably be found on my reg account) to get into this post. My wife and I are having a major disagreement about what to do and the word ""asshole"" has come up more than one time on both our parts. So here I am. 

Every year one for the past 10 of either my wife's siblings or mine has hosted a ""sibling BBQ"" some weekend in August. It started off as a way to just get to know each other since we are all family now but's it morphed into an actual event where some years T-shirts are made, cousins are now invited, we've had a band, rented a hall when it's too hot. It's a really fun day. This is our year to host. 

I have a younger sister who is just a political firebrand, whatever her politics may be, she can't help but turn just about any discussion into a political one. And it always goes one way, she steers the conversation to what she wants to talk about, she starts to lecture, she starts to get angry, she starts to get personal and she gets insulting and usually storms off. Especially with how divided things are, she gets so amped up and can't control herself. 

My sister is currently in a town about 4 hours away. I thought we could bypass her lectures this year as she wouldn't be willing to make the drive. Well she just texted me that she has some dates confused and she wanted to make sure sibling BBQ is happening today because if it is, she'll get on the road. 

I haven't responded yet. I want to just respond and tell her ""no sorry, not today"" and by the time she starts to see that family posting on social media that it is actually happening it will be too late for her to drive down. I would much rather deal with the fall out of lying to her than having to save her from getting punched in the face when she starts screaming that a cousin is a fascist or a cuck (again, whatever her politics may be). 

My wife says this a major assholish thing to do. I say the bigger assholish thing is to let her come and ruin everyone else's fun.

431,Not the A-hole,"Back story: 2003 I had two lines of cell service one for my mother and one for me. For 6 months never went over the minutes on the lines. Fast forward a few months my sister moves in and starts to take my mothers line from her and uses it. The next bill comes in and is $600 above the normal fees do to sisters use. I am unable to pay the bill and lose both lines. Some context: a few weeks after my sister goes crazy and commits crimes against both my mother and younger brother, police are called and she ends up arrested. 

Fast Forward to 2007: This is where the story takes place. A year prior I had gotten a cell plan witch included four lines of service, another feature was the plan had roll over minutes that built up for a year. Any unused minutes were saved and used in case I went over and I would pay no extra fees. My brother, mother and I each used a line and the other one just sat around with out use. One night my cousin comes over and I tell him how wonderful my plan is and how I have a crap ton of roll over minutes and even have a extra line sitting around. Cousin wants that extra line, so I think about and say you can have it for $30 a month till all the roll over minutes are used. Cousin takes the phone.

A week later I find out cousin gave the phone to my sister, as soon as I find I make contact with cousin. I tell cousin this isn't happening and he needs to get the phone from sister and return it. Cousin says I am being an a-hole and have no reason not to let sister use the line. I don't like bringing up peoples dirty laundry but had no choice at this point. I tell cousin back in 2003 sister took and used my mothers line of service I was paying for and caused $600 of overages and this isn't going to happen again.

Cousin then say, you are just doing this cause your mother and brother falsely accused sister of committing crimes against them. At this point I am furious and say, you have some nerve making lies up and for your information mother and brother both had evidence after the crimes were committed which police used to convict her. Cousin then says, your mother and brother fabricated the evidence before police arrived and sister told him this so it must be true. At this point I had enough and say, you are delusional cause my mother called me and asked for the police stations phone number and while on the phone with my mother I could hear sister committing these crimes. I tell cousin he has two options give the phone back or I cancel the line.

Last night I really wanted to go out to dinner rather than cook, but it was fairly late and we wouldn't have made it to the casual dining restaurant until half an hour *before* their closing time.  My girlfriend insisted that by the time we finished it would be at least forty five minutes after closing and that we were being rude to the restaurant staff who just want to go home on time.  My position was that we'd hardly be the only ones the staff was waiting on and that they have no real expectation of going home at closing time anyway - most restaurant staff are going to be on shift for an hour or two after the customers leave cleaning up and tearing down.  We had a mild fight about it and ended up ordering pizza.

5216,Asshole,"Warning: this is a bit long. I’m on mobile. 

TLDR at the bottom. 

Background: I’m a medical student at my dream school. I will be the first to get a doctorate in my family. Most of my family and friends come from low income backgrounds and that’s the life I grew up in.

I’m living off scholarship in med school right now, but I am very good at budgeting and occasionally have funds to spend on the people I care about. Not a lot, but enough to take my grandma out to dinner or treat my best friend to a night out every once in a while. 

A lot of times people will insist on paying since I’m a student with no real income. I tell them I don’t mind, that I wouldn’t do it if I couldn’t afford to. They often insist anyway. Now, I do appreciate the gesture and their sentiment, but what usually bothers me is what a lot of these people say immediately afterward.

“You can treat me with expensive dinners and five star restaurants when you’re a rich doctor!” (Or some variation there of.)

Now this may just be me being petty but I really resent that people assume that I’m going to just want to blow money on them if I start actually making money one day. 

To me, a persons income shouldn’t ever be relevant to your relationship. Someone could make a million dollars and still take my ass to IHOP and I’d be over the moon that a friend wants to treat me to anything. 

It just really irks me because A LOT of people in my life say things like this. My mom, my friends, a lot of extended family. Basically anybody who occasional treats me to something, they basically say they’re treating me now so I can treat them later.
My best friend from college used to joke that she was “investing” in me now for when I could afford to treat her in the future. 

I feel like a huge asshole now because all I think now is that when I doing start actually making money I won’t want to spend it on anybody because they’re basically saying they’re entitled to the benefits of my labor because they treated me to dinner a couple of times when I was broke. 

I mentioned this to my mom and she called me ungrateful and said that I have to pay back people who supported me along the way. I countered that she was the only person who really financially supported me, and even then, I got through college on full scholarship, same for med school. She is probably the only person I’d want to take care of despite her entitlement simply because she’s actually always been there to support me when needed for things besides money.

She’s still convinced I’m being super petty, cheap, and ungrateful to everyone else. I honestly want to know if she’s right because sometimes even I have my doubts that I’m right. 

TLDR: Am I being petty for resenting people who say that they don’t mind spending money on broke me now because future rich me can treat them to even more fancy stuff later in life?

Edit: to clarify, I don’t believe all the people in my life who have made jokes like this are being genuinely serious. But there are a handful of people that do this repetitively that I think deep down are serious about it. 

And to amend: It wasn’t just my labor that got me to where I am. It took a lot of things coming together in just the right way and the help of a lot of people. 
I meant it more like it was not THOSE people who only make me feel like a cash cow who helped me get to where I am today.",36,47,0.79,AITA for resenting people who are waiting on me to be “rich” so I can treat them?,cx0als,2019-08-29 12:34:31,YTA,3385,AITA
6844,Not the A-hole,"I've been dating Jen for 6 months now.  She has a kid, Tommy, that is now 2.5 years old.  I was first introduced to him about 2 weeks ago.  Tommy doesn't speak.  At all.  He also didn't make eye contact, didn't seem engaged in anything other than the little toy in his hand that he kept...petting.  He also bit my leg.  Jen just said he was really shy, and didn't like new people.  I accepted this answer, but in the back of my mind I still thought something was awry.  I do have 4 cousins that are on the spectrum, and a lot of his behavior reminded me of what I have seen from them, but I didn't say anything because its not my field of specialty.

&#x200B;

This weekend, my Mom came to town so I suggested everyone just come to my apt and I'll order in (Jen and Mom have never met). Everyone got here, made introductions, everything was smooth, but I could tell my Mom kept looking at Tommy.  She kept trying to interact with him in different ways and I could tell she was gauging his response.  Now, my Mom has an Ed.D. in Early Childhood Education.  She's been a Child Psychologist for over 20 years.  Tommy sat in the living room petting his toy while we got the table and food set up.  They had been here for about 15 minutes before my Mom asked Jen, ""Is Tommy on the spectrum?""  Jen immediately seemed offended by the question, but replied that no he's just shy.  Jen also insisted that delayed speech runs in her family, and her brother didn't talk until he was 3 and he's an Engineer now.  My Mom just said OK and dropped the subject.  

&#x200B;

At one point in the evening my Mom pulled me aside and simply said, ""He shows strong signs of ASD.  You need to insist she get him a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation ASAP if she hasn't done so yet.""  While dropping Jen off at home, she blows up on me.  Apparently she thinks I must have been talking shit about Tommy to my Mom about him biting me before they got there, and thats why my Mom asked that question.  I literally never even told my Mom Tommy existed until tonight, we rarely speak.  I told Jen my Mom's extremely decorated background, and what she told me privately about Tommy needing an evaluation.  Jen flipped out.  She claimed there is nothing wrong with Tommy, all kids are different, how dare I call her kid retarded (I never said that at all).  

&#x200B;

At this point, something must be seriously wrong with her.  She said she hasn't taken him in for a developmental screening with his Pediatrician in over a year, and I know thats because she knows something is off.  I tell her its imperative she addresses this while Tommy is still young...the quality of his life could depend on it.  I told her shes being delusional and if she doesn't address this she is an unfit mother.  She spit on me after that.

im sorry but how is that a thing? but she is always judging someone for something and i just (as lame as this is about to sound) do not want all that negative bullshit in my life.

more over she does this thing where if im talking about my day whether good or bad she clearly doesnt care. She is always looking to talk about herself.

Okay, so, a little bit of backstory. My parents got divorced when I was really young, around 3 or so, after the divorce, my mom got remarried and didn’t really give two shits about my father. My dad died when I was 11, and I’ve been getting survivor benefits since then. I was able to get my own bank account last April when I was 17, but I had to have my mom on the account as well, since I was underage. 

After I turned 18, my survivor benefits started getting directly deposited into my account, instead of my mother’s. I didn’t realize this until a month or two later because my mom was taking all of it out.

When I asked her about it, she said that I was basically “paying rent” and that my survivor benefits were being used to take care of me.

Here’s some more backstory — my mother doesn’t give a shit about me. My mother has been abusing my sister (16) and I for years, my mom does not take care of us, and when she does, we have to BEG her to. I buy my own clothes, food, etc, I try to take up the least amount of resources in the house. My mom also doesn’t care that I’m still grieving my father, she says I need to move on and “get over it” despite my PTSD worsening from my father’s death.

My sister and I’s survivor benefits were used to fund my mother’s 3rd wedding and honeymoon back in December. We both get around $1000 a month and my mom takes all of it from both of us. 

I cannot work during the school year due to chronic illness and autism. I cannot apply for disability at the moment because of everything going on in the world right now. I graduate in a month and this will be the second to last time I get paid before I can actually apply for disability, but my mom will take all of that as well.

I got paid this morning, my mother hasn’t woken up yet, all my money is in my bank account.

I’m not worried about spending all of it in one day and needing it later in the month, I’m more worried about what my mother will do to me if I spend any of it at all.

7298,Not the A-hole,"So our family has been going through a bit of a stressful situation that I can’t detail, but it’s been putting a lot of pressure on my husband. So of course he is busy trying to make the right decisions for us, and can’t really be bothered with making other types of decisions. I tried to talk to him about what he would like to do for his birthday and he just couldn’t give me any answers. Fair enough, I totally get that. So I decide to make plans for him myself.

We have three kids. Oldest is 7 and youngest is 7 months. We can’t exactly do things on a whim and need to definitely plan it out in advance, especially if we want to do it without the kids.

So I decide to get a sitter for Friday evening (he works Sat-Wed). I got REALLY nice tickets to a local baseball game (which he LOVES to attend!) I asked him BEFORE I bought the tickets if this is a good idea and he said “yes thanks!” GREAT! Green light given!

Then I remembered that it’s my Dad’s birthday too (their birthdays are 4 days a part). They get along pretty well. So I figured, hey maybe two birds one stone? Neither my dad or husband like to be fussed about on their birthdays but definitely appreciate doing a little thing. So I asked husband if he would mind if I had my dad tag along with us for the game. He said he didn’t care. I asked again, and said “This first and foremost is your birthday present, so I just want to make sure you are OK with this, it’s your decision” and he just kind of brushed it off again. I asked again a few days later. He responded he didn’t care again. Alright, he can’t be bothered to make these little decisions and he says he doesn’t care, so I invited my dad. 

My dad is VERY excited about going to the game too. So I set up the baby sitter for the kids. I work until 5. Sitter comes at 6. Game starts at 7. 

Tomorrow is the game. This morning, husband said to me “How about we skip the game, and go to dinner and a movie instead?” I asked why. He said “The game doesn’t start until 7, it probably won’t end until 9. I have to be up early for work” I said “Okay but I am not sure how dinner and a movie would get us home earlier? We don’t have a sitter until 6. And I already got the tickets to the game. And I already invited my dad”. 

His face dropped. He said “I thought that was MY decision?” I said “Well it was, but you just kept saying you didn’t care, and I figured you really didn’t care, so I invited him”

He stopped talking and just said “k”. I can tell he is upset. I said “I’m sorry but I did try to ask what you wanted.

13309,Not the A-hole,"I work with a heavy set girl who has taken to calling people Heffer, which is a reference to a cow. She’s basically calling people fat, and some of the people she refers to as heffer are actually a bit heavy. So I’m walking down the hallway at work yesterday and I hear her call out: “move it along, heffer.”

I turned to see her smiling, so I asked her if she thought she of all people had the right to call people fat. I don’t think she understood what I meant at first, so I said to her that she’s half my height and probably twice my weight. Between the two of us, she’s the heffer. 

Now, I’m not friends with this person. We don’t have inside jokes. I only learned her first name recently. Anyway, she started crying and this morning I’m in the office first thing explaining that the whole situation was misinterpreted and I was only responding to her using the word first.

She asked my advice on this and I told her to stop looking and work on herself and love will find her. She got pissed in return, told me I'm wrong, that I could never understand because I'm not a mom, and that she's now gonna ignore me.

At that exact second, my boyfriend called me. (For reference it's a very happy, healthy, long term relationship that blossomed from me following my own advice.)

So I did.  I posted a picture to the group chat.  Most of my family loved it, except my aunt.  She said it would never due to be a marker and how I should be ashamed for doing it.  For clarity, my grandfather was cremated and his final wishes were to be buried with his son who passed as a baby.  My aunt has pretty much stopped us from getting grandpa a proper marker.

21916,Asshole,"My (28M) parents own a beach house. We stayed their for a couple of days to celebrate the 4th of July. 

The house has two bedrooms. My parents stayed in one. The other room was for me, my girlfriend of one year (32F), my brother (34M), and my little sister (23F). The room has two double beds. 

After dinner, I took a walk with my GF. When we got back to the room, my brother and sister were on one bed. He was sleeping and she was playing with her Switch. I asked her nicely if she could stay on the other bed beside my GF so I could stay beside my brother. She said no. 

We grew up in a Catholic family. This means no sex before marriage, and I would rather not sleep on the same bed as my GF to avoid temptation. So I was hoping my sister would understand. 

I tried to explain to her, but she got progressively more annoyed. She was so noisy that she woke up my brother, who asked what the problem was. I explained it to him too, but he sided with my sister. 

My brother said I had two choices. One, I could suck it up and sleep beside my GF, which might lead to something more happening. Or two, I could sleep on the couch. 

I was hurt that they couldn’t understand where I was coming from, but ended up sleeping on the couch. 

The next day, my GF told me that she was sad that it seemed like my sister didn’t like her. My sister didn’t talk to my GF the whole night. She only talked to our brother. 

I confronted my sister about this, and she told me to “fck off.” This made me angry, because I was just trying to have a conversation with her. I tried telling her she needs to be more respectful.

14045,Not the A-hole,"Ive had my dogs since before we were together. We got together in HS and now decided to live together as we attend uni in the same state.

I chose to take my dogs with me because they were always MY dogs, i took care of them, fed them, trained them. Moreover, they ***feel*** mine. They love me more than anyone in my family, follow me even to the bathroom. They are super well behaved but also I have to admit they are very possessive of me, wanting to hug all the time (as in lay against me while they sleep) 2 of them are super small, one is medium sized, all mutts.

My bf wasnt excited to live with them but he wasnt against it either.

But now he is, 4 months into our living together he told me an ultimatum - either I send the dogs to my parents/shelter/new owner or he leaves. 

As arguments he presented that they have to sleep in our bedroom ( they do, but they don't sleep on the bed, they have their own small dog beds) so he cant focus while having sex, they are always near me, that they lick me and I kiss their foreheads - both of which he finds disgusting - and that out flat is too small anyway to have 3 dogs in it. When i said he had no problem before we moved in, he claimed he thought i will come to my senses already and ""besides, you wouldnt move in if I told you to leave your dogs and I love you too much to live away from you""

I was heartbroken but when he said he will leave if I dont get rid of the dogs, I packed my stuff and moved to my friend's flat. She was looking for a roommate anyway (thankfully) and accepted the dogs. 

I thought we were over, cried my heart out for a week and now after 2 weeks he called me and said he ""made a mistake"" but that he was hurt I loved dogs more than him. My whole family is on his side. Even my friend said I overreacted and that they would be mad too if ""i broke up with them over a dog"".

1710,Not the A-hole,"I do my meal prepping and baking all in one go so I have food to get me through the whole week. I noticed my boyfriend was taking some. I didn't mind, I like that he likes my cooking/baking, so I just started to make double batches. One batch with my recipes usually makes between 10 and 14 of whatever it is (cookies, muffins, cupcakes, ect), which is around 2 a day for me, so double batches means between 20 and 28 of whatever it is. However, I've noticed that I'm still running out before the end of the week, which means he's having more than 2 a day. I've never approached this with him, as I know that when he's stressed he tends to overeat and he's got a lot going on right now.

I decided to make cupcakes earlier this week, and I made a chocolate cupcake base, but then I split the batter in two, and flavoured one with chilli and the other with mint. My boyfriend loves chilli, but I hate it, and I love mint, but he hates it. To differentiate, both flavours were coloured and then marbled. The mint chocolate cake was a visible swirl of dark brown chocolate cake and bright green mint cake. The chilli was a mix of dark brown and vivid red. When I was done there were maybe 10 mint chocolate and 20 chilli chocolate. Didn't actually count, so that's an estimate.

I figured those would last him until my next baking day, a week from that day, but it's been 4 days and he's already polished off all 20 cupcakes. Tonight, in a way that was not rude or angry or anything like that, he started talking about the cupcakes, asking me to make more of the chilli but not to make the mint ones again because he hates mint. I responded that I was going to make both because I don't like chilli. He then realised I made those cupcakes specifically for him.

What happened from there was a conversation where was asking me why I went out of my way to make two different batches of cupcakes, one he likes and one he hates, and eventually I admitted that I made those because I figured he'd eat the chilli and leave the mint chocolate alone. He asked why I did it like that and I said, in the nicest way possible, that he'd been getting through them pretty quickly lately and I wanted to make sure I had some for lunch.

\#He then got upset, saying that if he was overeating I should have said something, and I said, also getting upset, that I'm not about to start a log of what he eats. I said I'd noticed he gets through the baking I made pretty quickly, I wanted to make sure he had something he liked, and I liked that he liked my baking, but I also wanted to set some stuff aside for myself, and I didn't mean for it to start an argument. He replied that I was babying him, especially by making stuff that he would eat and stuff he wouldn't. He said that I might as well have held them out of his reach for all the dignity I left him. Then he said he didn't want to talk about this any more, and he's left to stay at his place tonight.

Info:  

I think he's just stressed. He's got about half a dozen projects all due before the end of the month and they're not exactly small pieces.

10299,Not the A-hole,"Last year my younger brother (20) stole 3k in cash from me as well as lots of random trinkets and priceless belongings. I caught him red handed and confronted him, which he denied for a while until finally admitting to (some) of it. 

Note that earlier in the year i lent him $400 which he never repaid. I got him 3 jobs (on my good word) all of which he lost. Then he crashed his car, parents bought him a nice new civic and he crashed that. When he crashed the civic I went to the accident, took the weed out of his car so he didn’t get a DWI and cleaned the broken glass off our neighbors driveway for them. 

Instead of berating after catching him stealing I calmly explained how everyone makes mistakes and this doesn’t define him, gave him an opportunity to help me move furniture and do some work I needed a hand with and took the opportunity to talk about life with him. I gave him the chance to confess to our dad on his own instead of having me tell him, which he thanked me for (of course I still gave my dad a heads up). 

Side not, when I told my dad that he stole from me and that I highly suspect he may have a drug problem, probably Xanax, my dad responded by telling me he doesn’t even leave his wallet out anymore because money keeps going missing. He broke down crying and told me he would move out from his wife and son and get a place with me if I needed help (I didn’t need that but the gesture showed me just how cornered he was feeling).

My brother needed to get our step mom a birthday gift the same day I confronted him and my dumb ass lent him $30 to buy her a gift which he assured he would repay me. Of course he didn’t.

Fast forward a few days... Instead of confessing to our dad he twisted the story to my step mom instead and completely omitted his worst offenses. 

I snapped when she confronted me and made it very clear that he is a lying manipulative brat that I highly suspect of being a drug addict. 

Next time I saw him I blew up and told him he was dead to me. It’s been nearly a year since that and the only thing I’ve said to him was “happy birthday stay safe” in a text to which I got no reply, I haven’t talked to my stepmom once and I talked to my dad only half a dozen times. My dad wants me to call him and work things out but I can’t wrap my head around how to even begin that conversation. I strongly feel that he is an adult and he needs to be the one to begin repairing this broken relationship.

TLDR: my younger brother stole a ton of money from me after I lent him money, helped him avoid a DWI and he lost a few jobs that I got for him with my good word.

4391,Not the A-hole,"In 2015 I rented an apartment for $3350 a month with a $3350 security deposit. She was a less than stellar LL often taking days to respond. She had me pay rent directly to an out of the way bank, and I was once late when he wouldn't accept a postdated check while I was away. I sent it in but was charged a $200 late fee. She never gave me an electric bill, but after the first 6 months, she sent one for $1800. I started writing my checks for $3500 so $150 would cover it. Over 4 years I helped them out by fixing things myself in order to save them the hassle and hoping my kindness would be paid forward.

As per the lease, I expressed my intent to leave within the allotted time and they accepted my notice to move by August 9th. I had it professionally cleaned with the carpets. I was told that I had to have the parking spaces cleaned for oil spots. Although there was no notice in the lease regarding this, it was easier to have it done for $100.

Upon final inspection we met, and I submitted all receipts and the keys. She mentions that there  were missed oil spots in the parking stall and it would have to be re-cleaned. She then asked me questions about damage that was there before I moved in. I explained it was on the pre-inspection checklist. There was also a stubborn stain on the carpet that didn't get out 100%. She asked me repeatedly if I had an animal and if it was urine from a dog. I politely explained I have never had any pets there.

I have moved many states away and in the last month have received many texts and e-mails asking me about a pet and describing very minimal damages. I told her I had no pets and those items were damaged prior. Of course, I cannot inspect these items now.

Last week I received a letter, saying she forgot to mention there was over $3000 of unpaid electricity and that they had to fix items they re-cleaned some things (with costs but no receipt). None of this was mentioned when we were in the apartment. There were no receipts and the estimates had no cost. Also not mentioned were my 3+ years of paying an extra $150 for electricity.

I came from a very renter friendly state and the laws are written as such. A few examples are: 1. Notice of any withheld money must be sent or delivered on or before the 14th day after expiration. 2. Any work done or money to be collected must be accompanied by receipts. 3. If there was estimated work to be done, it must have an amount.

In regard to these issues, 1. The notice was postmarked August 24th, and since the lease ended on the 9th, the 24th would be considered the 15th day. 2. No receipts were given for work done or the electricity. 3. The estimated work was left blank.

WIBTA to demand all of my deposit back? The law is clear about notice on or before the 14th day. The law allows me to sue for 3x the deposit plus court costs.

I clicked it off and forgot about it for a while.

That night, I did some porn-browsing. I ended up downloading about five photos to my desktop, to be put in my “saved” folder later on. These five photos were all VERY, VERY graphic.

Twice during the first act and again during the second act a baby started crying during the show. It happened during some of the more serious moments of the show and I was very annoyed. 

I turned to my friends during intermission and after the show and said: who brings a baby to a show? I was really annoyed but my friends (who aren’t usually theatre goers) thought it was no big deal. They said maybe the parents couldn’t get a babysitter or something and I should have empathy for the parents.

Am I the asshole for having no sympathy for the parents? If you can’t make arrangements for your baby, then you can’t go see a play or musical.  Wait until the kid is old enough to control their actions and possibly even enjoy the show. It’s not like you can easily leave the theatre if the baby decides its time to cry.

14117,Asshole,"This morning my wife informed me that she was going to RSVP for her friend’s bachelorette party.  It is going to be a 3 night trip to Cancun at a 4-star all-inclusive resort in Mexico with around 8 girls.  The cost for the resort and flights is roughly $850 per person and I’m assuming the total cost of the trip will easily pass $1000.

I initially balked at the cost and asked if there was maybe another option for a bachelorette party or if she could stay at one of the other, cheaper resorts in the area (there are quite a few in the area that are significantly cheaper and she could purchase day passes to the expensive, 4-star resort the bride chose).  

She got defensive and brought up the fact that 2 years ago we were guests at a friend’s destination wedding (I was a groomsman) at a different resort in Mexico that ended up costing us around $800 total.  In addition, I went to a bachelor party in Vegas that year (although I went on the cheap, stayed one night sleeping on a hotel floor and ended up actually winning several hundred dollars which covered all costs and put me $600 ahead).


I guess what really makes me upset about this is that about a year ago my wife unilaterally decided to effectively stop working as a realtor (where she made around $60k) and began working as a Zumba instructor instead while doing a little bit of realtor work (making under $20k).  This has made me, a teacher, have to pay basically all of our bills for the past year and has put us in a pretty tight spot financially.

I’m already a bit thrown off because a few people in the party ordered appetizers that the rest of us didn’t eat, yet when calculating the they split the app evenly. (It was only a $2 difference for me so I didn’t want to make a fuss). Also, I asked everyone $1 for tax when it was actually $1 and some change to keep things simple.

But when everyone sent me their payments later, I was about $15 short. One person owed me at least $5 more and she gave it to me then but I was still left about $7 short. I went home and did the math and it ended up being that a few people were just $2 or $1 short, but it all adds up. As a college student, I could get a whole other meal for $7.

I jotted down the math and sent a pic to my friends explaining how everyone’s bill chalked up and who still owed. But honestly, they seemed a bit perturbed that I was making an ordeal out of just a few dollars.

AITA for asking for exact change? I thought I was doing a favor by putting it on my card (and honestly in the past, when someone has paid for me I always overpay them a little back if anything!)

EDIT: lots of people asking why he couldn’t split the bill. One of the guys in our group knew the restaurant owner, so we were offered a discount but the server could only apply that to one bill. Either we could all get the discount one bill, or it would only go toward one person. Everyone wanted the bill together so we could all get the discount (though I said I didn’t mind just splitting)",46,51,0.9,AITA For asking for exact payment from friends?,bh5s28,2019-04-25 07:25:50,NTA,1789,AITA
5792,No A-holes here,"My dad passed away shortly before I \[now 30M\] was born. My mom, who kept her maiden name, gave me my dad's last name ""to carry on his legacy"". The next bit will sound harsh but it's important. Mom almost never talks about dad and when she does, there's no hint of sadness, only fondness. She's not 'actively mourning' if that makes sense.

In March I proposed to my gf \[32F\] and she said yes. Yay! Soon after, we discussed whose last name we would take, because we both wanted to have the same last name as each other and our future kids. My fiancee is in a niche career where name recognition is very important (being vague for anonymity). I've been with the same company for years and plan to stay here, so I felt like it would be easier for my name to change. After discussing it a bit, we decided to both take her last name. It helped that I only share my last name with a bunch of distant relatives, while she has many siblings and cousins with the same last name.

We didn't make an announcement about this, not seeing it as a big deal, and only told people who expressly asked. Lots of people did actually ask, because in her field this is a common issue (eg, her family found out early because one of her bridesmaids asked at a dress fitting in front of her mom and sister.) My mom never asked and we never raised it.

Well, I don't know who, but someone told my mom last weekend at a party we were hosting. Mom came up to me almost in tears and asked if it's true that I'm changing my name. I took her aside and said yeah, and explained why. She said some surprising things - that this is a betrayal to my dad and to her,  it's like I'm completely turning my back on my family, and she couldn't believe I would ""throw away"" the name that's meant to honor my dead father. I tried to explain that's not how i see it at all and I didn't realize she was still in such pain over my dad, but she wasn't having any of it. She asked why we didn't discuss it with her and I said, truthfully, because we had already discussed it with each other and made up our minds. This did not go down well and she left the party in tears. I've tried to call her since but she texted me to say she needs some time.

My fiancee and I have been discussing this a lot. We both don't think that we're TA for taking her name (but welcome any judgements). However she thinks that maybe we were TA for not discussing it with my mom first and letting her find out this way. Knowing now how she feels about it, I do wish we'd spoken to her privately, I guess I just really didn't think she'd be upset. However I remain firm that we didn't need to discuss it with her. We had discussed all of the options with each other and it would have been disingenuous to ask for her input when we weren't going to change our minds no matter what she said.

AITA?

Edit: Wow, thank you for the silver and the responses! Sorry, I went to work and stopped replying to comments, and have just got back to this (with fiancee) to go through everything. Thanks everyone for your thoughts and your personal stories, and to those who said YTA-, we fully understand and plan to apologize to mom for upsetting her.

19240,Asshole,"weird title, and this’ll sound fake, but it’s 100% true. my girlfriend (26F) and i (29M) have been dating for 5 years and have been living together for 1. shes vegan and health conscious and i am too. but here’s where the problem lies.

she really likes proportioned foods. things that are already packaged in small portions to prevent her from over-snacking. that’s normal, but she gets these small apple sauce pouches and these fruit purée pouches, small low calorie snacks that are literally made by Gerber and they’re intended for literal babies. 

she likes them bc to her, they taste good, they’re low calorie, and again, they’re already portioned into small servings. but it’s literally childish. it’s for BABIES. there’s plenty of “adult” foods that are small portioned and low calorie. every time we have family or friends over they always comment on that food being in the fridge and some even question if we have a kid or not. it’s just annoying and unnecessary. 

so i asked her to stop buying these snacks and get something more “grown up” and she simply said “no”. she even tried to show me on her phone that what she’s doing is common and that so many other adults eat these snacks but i wasn’t buying it so it broke into a whole fight, where i was calling her immature and saying she had to grow up (i know, that was rude) and she was saying that im being a dickhead for getting mad at her for something that she says is harmless.

6407,Everyone Sucks,"I guess it's relevant but I'm 26f. So for some background my sister is going through an ugly, ugly divorce from her husband who none of us have ever liked. They did however agree that is was best for my niece, AJ, to be somewhere else this summer so I said I'd love to take her with me. I am in a phd program and completely burnt out so I decided to take the summer completely off and just hang out with her. She is an amazing kid and incredibly extroverted and has made a ton of friends her age. She really wants to be 21 and while she's very cute, she's obviously a teenager. 

I live in a rapidly gentrifying college area neighborhood in my grandparents old house. Most of the houses are airbnbs now but a few are still college rentals. Such is the house behind me. It's sort of like a ""frat house extension"" as all the guys that live there are in the same frat. They are totally cool and I'll occasionally hang out and drink beer, watch football, etc... they do have a above ground pool and one or more of them is in the pool near 24 hours a day. 

So last week I did have to go into work and I came home and found AJ and a 2 friends literally peeking through the slats in the fence toward the ""frat"" house. I asked what they were doing and she said the frat guys were so hot. I was like that's normal but peeking is not cool. They sort of giggled and agreed to not to it again. 

I ran into one of my neighbors and he said that he wanted to let me know that AJ and a friend had actually hopped the fence and wanted to ""hang out"" and stayed there for several minutes despite being asked to leave. He said AJ was sort of a teenage version of flirty and made them all uncomfortable but the guys were polite and were able to walk them through the yard to leave. I asked if it was a big deal to them, he said not at all, he just didn't want any misunderstandings. I said no problem. 

AJ's dad (my soon to be ex brother in law) called me this weekend to see how she's doing. I pretty much explained the situation like I did above. He absolutely freaked out and wanted to know what I hadn't called him right away. I said it really didn't seem like that big of a deal to me and she was just being a normal kid. He wanted to know who the ""sluts"" where that were talking her into this, I said I think actually AJ was the one that hopped the fence first. He wanted to know how I was punishing her, I said I wasn't. He screamed at me that he was coming to get her (he lives 19 hours away). So I called my sister and she's mad that I ""created a situation"" that could now be used against her. I told her I was really sorry that I was just gone for 2 hours. Now she claims to be on her way to pick up AJ before soon to be ex can get here.

1739,Not the A-hole,"A little background info, I (25f) grew up in a rough household. Both parents were drug addicts, constantly in jail and so forth. Lived in a one bedroom trailer with five brothers. Grew up and also became an addict, I am currently five years sober living with my fiance in a hotel bc we have been trying to save money for a house. 

Well we got approved for a mortgage and we are house hunting. My mother (56) never really got her life together when my father passed away over 15 years ago. She lives with her abusive/drunk husband now and has for the past 6 years. We have a great relationship but its more of a friend/I'm her mom relationship. I have to help her with saving money and so forth. I love my mom more than anything and told her she could move in with me and my fiance when we get a house to get her stuff together and save up some money so she can make it on her own. 

Well my brother (30m) is currently homeless bc of his bad choices in the past. He sleeps in his car and gets a hotel room two nights a week out of his check. He has been sober for over eight months and I'm proud hes trying to get his life together. 

I mentioned to my mom that after a year of living with us and saving, her and my brother should get a place together to help each other, she was not happy. She asked me what I meant when I said after a year. I had told her previously that it would be temporary her living with us bc my fiance wants us to have a life and do our own thing and basically just be adults. She tried to guilt trip me and say she might as well stay with her abusive husband if I was just going to kick her out after a year. It worked and I do feel extremely guilty and have tried to talk to my fiance and just let her stay with us. He is very adamant on her only living with us for a short period bc he says she takes advantage of my kindness and walks all over me. 

I feel like a complete asshole for not helping my mother and brother more but honestly if she keeps this up then I'm just going to not help her at all.

Edit: I just want to say thanks to everyone for the advice it has helped tremendously. Me and the fiance talked last night and she will not be living with us.

12481,Asshole,"I split up with my ex a year ago. When we split, I moved long distance and hired a moving company. They grabbed a box of my ex's school and work related degrees/certificates/awards by mistake. When I unpacked, I found the box and told her about. She also said that she had found a few of my things. I arranged for a friend who was visiting me in my new city to transport the items (the box of degrees to her, my box of of stuff to me). For reasons I don't understand, she didn't have the box ready in time, even though she had five months.

&#x200B;

A few more months went by, and I grew tired of the delay, and gave her two weekends to get the items to me. She did, but she didn't pack the box carefully, and a couple of things got ruined: a $1000 leather coat, and my dad's overcoat (dad is deceased, so it's a cool coat because it's vintage and well made, but also has sentimental value). A bunch of paperwork she included got trashed, but it was all garbage anyway, so I don't care.

Now I have this big box of degrees, certificates, and work-related awards that I need to mail back. I'm not sure how much it will cost, but it's a big heavy box (almost the size of a bankers box).

18204,Everyone Sucks,"This weekend I was walking through the park and I saw a cat that looked like one I had seen on posters that were posted around the neighborhood. They said there was a reward of $500 for finding their lost cat. So I caught the cat, which was pretty easy since he was friendly, and checked a poster to see if it was him - it was.

I went home, put him in the back porch, and called the number on the poster to let them know I found their cat. They were happy that I found him and said they could come pick him up right away. I confirmed that there was a $500 reward, texted the guy a picture of the cat, and gave him my address.

This is where the problem started. When he got to my house, I asked for the reward money before returning the cat. He said that there actually isn't a reward and that he only advertised one to increase the chance that people would look for his cat. I told him that I wasn't going to give his cat back until he paid the promised reward and that he shouldn't have posted one if he didn't want to pay one. He then got angry and threatened to call the cops if I wouldn't give him the cat. I said that he was welcome to and that I would be happy to get things on the record in case I had to take him to small claims court. He begrudgingly told me that he would be back later with the money. Later that night he came by with the full $500, I gave him his cat, and that was the end of it.

When I told my girlfriend about it, she thought I should have just gave him back the cat since it cost me nothing to catch him and that everyone was having hard times right now. Some of my friends also think that the guy was probably desperate to get his pet back and that it was kind of shitty for me to profit from a lost animal.

11527,Not the A-hole,"I will start by saying I pay for about 70-80% of me and my wife’s cost of living expenses (necessities). She makes about 1/3 what I do so I like for her to be able to save and have extra money for things she wants, vice dump it all into cost of living.

My wife has a friend called Yasmin. Yasmin is part of some group (it has a spanish name so I don’t know what it is) that says they empower women. My wife told me about this group one day, apparently you submit $1000 (somewhere or to someone??) and become a level 1 group member, gaining levels by recruiting more members. Once you reach level 5 or so of the community, you have about 30 people under you, and you graduate from the community and receive $30,000. All the while the group is supposed to support each other and help you attain your goals by giving you that cash infusion at the end. The whole process is supposed to take 2 months.

As soon as she told me about this, the words MLM, scam, and other things came to mind. In my opinion, this is some type of MLM disguised in a veil of “empowerment of women.” Yasmin is 4 months in and still trying to recruit people because she has not seen her money yet. Somehow Yasmin has convinced my wife to join this cause. I tried explaining to her that some MLMs *do* actually work, but those stories are few and far between and only to the insider people who started the whole thing in the first place, never the grunts that join later. I told her that if she does this she will 1) never see her money again 2) become an embarrassment to herself as she begins to essentially ask all her friends and family for money to join the program so that she can get hers 3) waste a lot of time when this never works out. I think she has good intentions, at least as far as wanting to make more money and contribute, but she has somehow gotten tricked into thinking this get rich quick maneuver will work.

When she told me she wanted to join I fought her on it and told her that I will stop helping her pay for things on this main basis: I am currently doing so because I like to help her with her basic needs/necessities so she can spend her money on things she wants.  Because this $1000->$30,000 is not a 100% guarantee, she is essentially gambling her money that she will turn a profit. In this perspective, she has money beyond her basic wants and she even has enough to gamble with, therefore there is no reason for me to still be supporting her needs/necessities.

I don’t want kids, my partner does. It wasn’t a consideration when we both got together because we were super young. 16 to be exact. 

He always told me that “not having kids is no big deal with him,” and “he’s fine with that,” and “he never wanted kids anyway,” but I think I was kidding myself by believing that. 

He loves kids. When he was in high-school, he use to babysit for our entire neighborhood. He was awesome with them, and everyone trusted him. Even with the babies. When one of our friends got pregnant, he was happy and smiling for a full on week. He always wanted updates. Said he would help with anything. All our neighbors kids love him. He worked at daycares during college. He’s a cook now, but he said he would have loved to be a teacher. He was a huge help in raising his siblings. He has more of a parent-caretaker relationship with them than a sibling one. 

So, yeah, I’m kidding myself when I believed his nonsense about not wanting kids. So, we got drunk one night and I asked him why he always says he doesn’t want kids even though he seems to love them. He was basically like, “because I get to be with you. I’m fine with giving that up, even though it really sucks. I know you’ve never wanted kids.” 

And I don’t. I’ve never particular liked kids. At least not enough to put my job and life on hold. I definitely don’t want to be the host of one. But knowing that he’s giving up something he clearly wants a lot to be with me hurts. 

I’ll never want to be the host of a child, but something like a surrogate is an option. But I’d straight up not want to have to change diapers or wake up in the middle of the night. I’m about to be a doctor, and I definitely don’t want this to impact my career at all. I’m such a bad person.

My mom has season tickets and I had my son who is 11 months old and wanted to take him to the game and asked my mother if she would take my son and me. So it was raining very bad out and I didnt want to take my kid on the public transit for how rainy it was and how young he was so we decided to drive to the stadium and park at the stadium. The second we got into the vehicle and started driving my mom started complaining saying we should have just taken the light rail and she doesnt want to pay for parking because she knows right now I'm not doing great financially and am living paycheck to paycheck with everything going on in my life. As we get closer she starts getting louder in the car and basically yelling at me for making her pay for parking. As we are on the highway about to get on to the main highway to get us to the stadium I have the choice of going north or south, north takes us to the game south takes us home and I looked at her and said,"" fine we don't need to go to the game so you dont need to pay for parking I can just turn around and we can go home"" she sits in silence for a second then continues to complain about how much she will spend on parking so at the last second I went south to go home which resulted in silence for the 25 min drive back to her house. When we got to her house I made the decision to just drop her off so when I pulled up she scoffs at me, gets out and slams my car door shut and makes a couple comments under her breath.

21044,Not the A-hole,"I have been living for three years in a village that unfortunately has very few parking spaces. My house is located on a small but steep hill, as is the one of my neighbours. Since their garage (big enough for two cars, but so full of garbage that there is no room for a car there) is at the foot of the hill, they park their cars in the general visitor parking lots, which are located directly in front of our houses on top of the hill. They are just too lazy to clear out their garage or walk the 200 stairs from the garage at the bottom of the hill to their house on top of the little hill. My garage is next to my house, right on the hill. That's why I only use the visitor parking lots when I have visitors. But when I do, Kevin and Karla show up at my door within minutes and complain that I use their parking spaces. FYI: These are available to the general public, the two of them just think that they belong to them alone. You can't talk to them calmly about it because Kevin drinks a lot and Karla is agreeing with everything he says.

Since I rarely need these visitor parking spaces, I have accepted it, for better or worse. But now there is another problem that I do not want to accept:

Kevin and Karla's daughter - let's call her Jessica - has had a moped for a few months now. She parks it in front of my garden entrance (a gate which I only use once a month). She didn't ask me if that is ok for me. So I told her and her father that I don't want that. She didn't park there for a few weeks, then it was right in front of it again. And also that of her boyfriend. So now two. I asked Jessica again politely not to park the moped outside my backyard driveway. She didn't ask me if that is ok for me. I already told her and her father that I don't want that. She didn't park there for a few weeks, then it was right in front of it again.

I confronted her and her mother yesterday about the situation. They don't see how it can bother me, because I don't use the driveway very often. They think it's mean that I force their princess to park the moped in her garage (a moped just fits in despite of the trash). So now she has to climb 200 stairs everyday because of me and that is too exhausting for her. But for me this is a matter of principle.

The moped will soon become a car. And I don't want them to park it in front of my gate. I don't want to have to ask my neighbours to drive away if I want to reach my own property.

If she’s screaming and crying, the moment she gets that toy she stops. Every time she is with someone else i always say do not loose that toy, i say it every time even if I’ve told them before. This toy is a homemade knitted bear/comforter made by a family friend who passed away 2 months after my daughter was born and cannot be replaced by a replica.

14238,Not the A-hole,"No throwaway because I don't think 85 year olds use Reddit too much.

Anyway, here's the scoop...

So my grandma moved in with us last year; she got too old to take care of herself so this was the next best option. I love her, and have always been very close to her, but this has turned into a different ballgame. Over the course of probably the last six months or so she's continued to get worse in terms of how she treats people, but I don't know how I'm supposed to respond to it. She's called my girlfriend a brat - to her face. She constantly guilts me if I'm not home that night to eat supper (even though I'm there like 4 times a week), and has just started being passive aggressive overall. Her and I share a bathroom, and she started locking my entrance to the bathroom to try and keep me out - plenty of small things like this that have just continued to add up.

My conundrum is this. She's 85, I'm not entirely sure if she understands what her actions are doing, and sometimes she speaks before saying what she wants. Each thing she does isn't enough to warrant getting pissed about, but all this added up seems like enough. I just don't know if this is a battle worth picking.

Also, other family members in the house have mentioned minor annoyances with her before, but she just turns it into a guilt trip saying she's a burden on the family and starts crying. WIBTA?

Edit: Not literally ""fuck off."" Definitely a fairly harsh conversation though because of previous experience with her guilting behavior since normal conversations haven't worked.

9958,Asshole,"Up front, let me say that I will almost certainly get her a present bc I don't believe in retribution like what I'm about to describe, but I am sorely tempted...

My stepdaughter is about to turn 15. She insists on making a huge deal of her birthday. Everyone has to be nice to her, do whatever she wants, evening they hate the activity, etc. Fine. We celebrate birthdays in our house as that person's day to do what they want. And I personally enjoy birthdays all around.

Here's the problem: Even when it's not her birthday, my stepdaughter is incredibly selfish.  She's also a scorekeeper and always insisting on everything being equal (tracking if her brother gets something she doesn't, not offering to help with things, always expecting us to go out of our way for her and rarely saying thank you while also never ever wanting to do things for others). A lot of this is typical teenage behavior but trust me when I say it is relentless.  On top of this, over the last year, she ignored or forgot her mother's  birthday, her father's, and mine. Like, didn't even ask if she could get anyone a card. When her brother's birthday rolled around, she made him a card at the last minute and that was it. This despite the fact that her younger brother spends his own money to get her birthday presents.

Last year, my mother sent her brother money for his birthday months after hers. My mom is older and had forgotten hers, so of course her reaction was to be mad that she didnt get anything. This year, my mom remembered. 

Now, given all of this, she still acts as if she should be queen on her birthday and everyone should treat her birthday exactly the opposite of how she treats theirs.

I want to treat her as she's treated others. WIBTA?

PS, I might also add she does the same thing at Christmas and gets no one anything at all while expecting everything. This has been pointed out to her many, many times.

EDIT: Just a point of clarification since it has come.up multiple times. I have only been in her life for 3 1/2 years. The birthday issue is just the one that is immediate, but her behavior towards other people has been constant despite all of her parents discussing it with her. This is not simply a matter of teaching her better as nothing we've done on that front has mattered and this behavior is not learned from any of her parents. 

She doesn't treat people well in almost any situation, to the point that her stepmother really has little to say to her and that she has no true friends. I keep hoping she will learn and a blatant demonstration of how she makes others feel (e.g., when she ignores their birthday) is only the latest attempt to illustrate that for her in a way that sinks in.",118,312,0.93,WIBTA if I didnt get my stepdaughter a birthday present?,c59bn2,2019-06-25 14:24:47,YTA,2711,WIBTA
14194,Asshole,"I’m probably going to be ripped to pieces on here, but I’d genuinely appreciate an insight to see if I need to change my mindset. 

I am 28 years old and my partner is 36. His child/ my stepchild is 14 and lives primarily with his mum. 

I and my partner do not make much money. When we got married, 3ish years ago, my family gave us some cash as a gift. We used it to fund our honeymoon as neither of us really had savings. 

Last year husband and I were going through some heavy shit in regards to my husbands health and I decided I would book us a holiday. He flat out said he couldn’t afford ANY savings to put towards a holiday, but I said I would handle it and saved about a grand to take us to Egypt for a week. I worked overtime for it, and paid for literally everything including food + dining out + drinks. Last year he expressed a strong desire for us to take his son,  but I gently told him that I could only really save for both of us. An extra person would incur a £500 extra charge and I just didn’t feel comfortable spending that out of my money. He didn’t argue it and was cool with it.

This year proved a bit shit again- only for me this time. I would like another holiday but finances are extra tight because I have lost my job and would be paying for this holiday out of small errands I’ve begun to do for neighbours and the like. My husband has started a new job that literally pays 50% more what he was getting paid before, but he’s also helping out with paying for my car and paying off other of his debts. He said that in a few months he can slowly start to put away cash for a holiday but right now he can’t. I understood that to mean he couldn’t commit. He also said that about getting me an engagement ring when we got engaged and sadly he’s not been able to save for that either, so I know I’m not to expect anything. I understand life is hard. 

However he also said that he really really wants to take his son away too. I said that again, I could really only afford to take myself and my husband away if we are solely doing this on my dime. But the truth is, I just don’t feel like I should be paying for my stepson, and strictly in the confidence of Reddit, I find him stressful to be around and so a holiday wouldn’t at all be a holiday for me. He is very needy of his fathers attention, quite spoiled (which his father has admitted to me before- he feels as though his son has a hard home life with his mother so wants to make up for it at our place) and is generally unable to give much more in terms of conversation beyond fortnite and pewdiepie. I knew getting married would mean that I needed to give him my money and time the same way as if it were my bio child, and I *do* buy him games and contribute financially sometimes for him- I just think a holiday is a really big ask. 

My husband seemed a little wistful and sad, but he also understood and was very supportive and said ‘don’t worry- we’ll make it happen’. I do feel bad though. AITA?",184,41,0.73,AITA if I fund a vacation/holiday but don’t include my stepson?,berwkp,2019-04-18 22:50:55,YTA,2983,AITA

Backstory, my work shift starts at 9am - 5pm every single day. They are my contracted hours, no more, no less. I get a 30 min unpaid break every day. 

I’m being weaned off of being on furlough. I am diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression & I am taking medication for it, however it’s a recent diagnosis so the medication hasn’t correctly settled in just yet.

‘This has come from higher up, you are all expected to be here 15 minutes before your shift starts or you will get a late warning. 3 late warnings and you’re terminated.’ 

I asked him if we were getting paid for those extra 15 minutes, since he is clearly stating that if we do not arrive at 8:45am, we will get late warnings, even though our contracted hours do not start until 9am. He said no, because ‘that’s just how retail is.’

5940,Everyone Sucks,"Background: My parents have a long history of oversharing their kids’ information.  Some were egregious: when my older sister started menstruating, they called a bunch of relatives and told them.  Some were just annoying: I was on a stressful work trip in a city 2 hours from where my mom’s cousin lives and mom made a point of calling to tell her, which meant I had to field calls and texts to explain why it wasn’t possible for me to go meet up with them in person during the 30 hr trip even though it was “so close”.  I still hear about how I came so near where they live but didn’t take time to go see them and it’s been 2 years!  

Currently: I recently bought a condo which is my first non-rental home as an adult.  I covered the down payment myself and have been financially independent since I was 24.  I did rely heavily on my parents during the closing process for advice on the paperwork, going over the inspection, and general knowledge of how things work when you are buying a home. I went for a visit and walked in to hearing my dad talking to his brother and he goes ahead and lays out how much my condo cost, how much of a down payment I made, how much my monthly mortgage will be, and what my condo fees will be.  I got angry and made a wtf? face while he was on the phone and once he had hung up, demanded to know why he was telling people this information.  My dad got really angry too and snapped back that I’m stupid for being upset about him sharing publicly available information with his own brother. Then stormed off muttering about how I have no values or sense of what it means to be family. 

I complained to my sister about it and with no hesitation, she told me I was unreasonable and that I had made a fuss over nothing.  I felt strongly in the moment and even now when I’m calm that my privacy was being infringed on, but it seems I’m the only one in my immediate family who thinks that.  Am I really the asshole here?

Update: Thanks for the feedback.  Many of you said that I shouldn’t have let them get so involved and I totally agree. At the time, I caved because my Parents were already so angry because they found out I was looking for a condo and made an offer without telling them.  There were tears and yelling from them and when dad demanded to see the papers, I wussed out and justified it by telling myself that at least I’d be able to avoid a big mistake if he is looking things over too.

19058,Not the A-hole,"My buddy (let’s call him Ben) and his girlfriend of 2 years just broke up. They got into an argument after she informed him that she stopped taking birth control. Ben said that she “blindsided” him with this information, and that he “can’t stay hard with condoms on”, so it will ruin their sex life. But what got him most mad was that she decided to stop taking birth control without talking it over with him, and she can’t be making huge decisions like that on her own without consulting him. She did not like how mad he got about it and it turned into an extremely ugly argument that ended with her breaking up with him.  

Ben was devastated and wanted a few guys and me to meet him at his bar. He told the story and all of my buddies were on his side. I was kinda shocked. I told him that it sucks he got dumped and i felt bad but at the same time he was in the wrong here. I went on about how taking birth control is totally up to her, and he can be “bummed” by the decision because sex without condoms is way better, but if she doesn’t want to take birth control, it’s her choice. I have a wife and lots of female friends, and I’ve heard countless rants on why birth control sucks and taking it can be a nuisance. It’s not like she told him about it mid sex, she told him right away. Then i said, half jokingly although it’s kind of accurate, “i love you man, but that was toxic af” and yes i said it like that to be comically dick. He did not like my response and said I was being an asshole. My one friend took me to the side and said that “this is no time to act woke, and that a bro always takes the bro’s side in a breakup”. It’s not like I plan on being friends with her and ditching my friend. I’m still gonna be friends with him, I just now know he has some warped opinions on birth control etiquette, and can’t hold a boner in condoms.

14049,Everyone Sucks,"So I knew this girl for a long time who I kinda grew up with, let's just call her Emily. So throughout secondary school me and Emily were kinda on and off every now and then, not fully going out but having light fun here and there. Then when we were about 16 it got a little more serious. We were each other's first time for everything up to sex, which we didn't have at that stage, and it was fun, but called it quits after a while. Then I got a girlfriend for a year, and I lost my virginity to her. That relationship ended really badly, and fast forward to when me and Emily are both 18 and in our final year of school. We were all out at the club one night and got drunk, then I ended up going back to Emily's house and we had sex. After that, we were kinda friends with benefits, having sex and other stuff often enough, but at the beginning before we did anything I said to her I didn't want a relationship because of the bad experience I had in the past, and was done with that stuff, to which she said no problem. So we weren't exclusive, yet she would get jealous any time I would mention another girl even though we are not together. Then one night she got with another guy, which I was fine with because like I said, we weren't going out. Then on New Years Eve, I got with another girl, and Emily saw us, and spent the night crying in the bathroom with her friends, and she wouldn't speak to me for a while. Then we made up and said it was fine for us to get with other people (our original agreement) and continued our FWB thing. I got with another girl then, and she absolutely cut me off, blocked me on everything and then got with other lads which I didn't mind, because that was our thing. I decided to end our FWB for good because she kept getting upset if I got with someone else, even though it was okay for her to do it. Now, any time we all go out to the club or anywhere, and I just do my thing and get with girls, Emily always ends up crying when she sees it even though we ended like 4 months ago, and even her friends are just like ""she needs to cop on"". So AITA for continuing to get with other people and moving on, while Emily still gets upset?

Edit: Also, she has rang me when she was drunk before and asked me to get back together and I've said no outright to her, because it's not okay for us to be FWB because although I see it as just that, she clearly wanted more and can't handle just the FWB

We don't live together, but we keep essentials at each other's houses. Naturally, my GF has a toothbrush at my place. Some more background, my GF is the type to get weirdly sentimental about anything she owns. As an example, I've seen her get teary when she accidentally lost a hair tie before. So, to the situation. One day we were dog sitting and the dog got her toothbrush and chewed it up really bad. No big deal I thought, I had a packet of new toothbrushes and I grabbed one for my GF. I was about to throw out her old brush when she yelled at me not to. She said she only wanted that specific kind of brush (honestly nothing fancy, normal brush). So I left her toothbrush but told her I would happily buy her a new one of the brand she wanted. She said no, her toothbrush is fine. Now it's been months since this happened, and she still refuses to get rid of the brush. It literally has MOLD growing on it, which I pointed out, and she casually shrugged off. I now keep her toothbrush separated from mine (because MOLD) but honestly I just want to throw it out and be done with it. WIBTA if I did and replaced her toothbrush with a new one?

Edit: Thank you all for your comments. I've tracked down the exact type of toothbrush and ordered it for her. When I get it, I'm going to sit down and have a talk with my GF about it.

My parents worked (and still do) full time and advised my older brother and I to do the same during summers in highschool. My brother and I would work full time in the summer and part time during the school year. My oldest sibling (my sister) was never told that she needed to get a job. 

Fast forward to now when my brother and I both worked enough to buy our own cars and are both in college.  Instead of my sister having to work for her car, my grandparents just gave her a car. They pay for all of her expenses, insurance, and gas while my brother and I have to pay for our own car expenses. And lately my sister has been acting extremely entitled. For instance, she's a senior in college and hasn't worked a single job during her entire college career. I suggested to her that it would be good to get a job her last semester to prepare for her career. She got extremely upset with me and hung up. Am I the asshole for getting upset with her?

7107,No A-holes here,"Throwaway for anonymity.

My parents passed away recently from a car crash (they were quite elderly). My sister and I are in our 30s, and the costs of two funerals is quite a lot of money for us. Because of such, our family lawyer friend who wrote our parents' will, is trying to expedite the execution of their will to pay for the funeral.


It turns out my parents left everything to my sister (around $2m), and gave me $50k cash. This is likely due to them not approving of who I married (she's a different race), but I was still shocked to hear how little they cared about me anymore, especially since when they were alive, they treated my sister and I as if we were equally loved. The worst part of it is, from what I know about law, they only left me the 50k so that I wouldn't be able to sue to my sister for half of the assets. The fact that they thought I'd even do that is what hurts more than anything. 

The will hasn't been executed yet and it may take a while, so my sister wants to plan the funeral without the money and pay off the debts later. She's asked to come over so we could plan the funeral and costs, and I told her no. I don't want to have anything to do with my parents funeral, whether it's helping pay for it or helping plan it. My sister seems very stressed, and I feel had about not helping, but every time I think of my parents now I get angry and upset. I don't think it's too much to ask that she pay and plan the funeral considering she's basically getting paid $2m to do it.

Until he sat me down and told me that he was dumping me. I was so shocked and the last thing I wanted to do, was let him know I was hurt. So I acted relieved. That confused him, so I told him that I was glad he was ending things. I didn't think I ever loved him, but now I won't hurt him and we can still be friends. No worries.

He got so fucking mad, and said that NOW there's no way, we could EVER be friends. He wanted to be friends, until I said I never loved him.

I didn't understand how he could be mad that I didn't love him, if he didn't love me? **Did he expect me to cry and beg for him to take me back?**

This was a couple weeks ago and we haven't talked since. I ran into his friend at a coffee shop and he paged the fuck out me. He said that what I told my ex ""seriously fucked him"". He doesn't sleep, or eat properly. He's behind in all his classes, and missed practices because of me. But I think it was probably more than just one comment I made. He called me an ""evil bitch"". I was in shock so I didn't say anything back.

What I said wasn't true, but I needed to seem so unbothered by being dumped. He broke my heart, but I didn't want to show it. I don't understand it (because he, dumped me), but it doesn't change the fact that I hate he's feeling this way. I did want to hurt him a little, at the time, I won't lie.

I get passive comments each year from at least two of them. I have had them tell me things like “I don’t like these color roses” or “that’s pretty but I’m not your mom”, and those comments hurt. Most of them acknowledge and say thank you and that’s that.

17135,Asshole,"I (22F) am currently in the midst of a *disagreement* with my boyfriend John (26M). The disagreement is mostly about my close friendship with a guy named Cody (23M). 

Cody has expressed attraction to me before, and I am also fairly attracted to him (he’s an attractive guy). I’ve never had any sort of sexual encounter with him, mainly because even when I was single I wasn’t a huge fan of the way that he tends to sleep around casually a lot, and because I think that sex can complicate friendships and I don’t want that. Cody and I are very close friends and are open with each other, and since I initially told him I wasn’t interested in sleeping with him he has never tried to initiate anything. He completely respects the fact that I said no and the fact that I’m in a relationship. We have a really strong friendship and I can’t imagine cutting him out of my life, but neither of us have any sort of romantic interest in each other and we treat sex extremely differently and understand that about each other.

Last week, John asked me if I was attracted to Cody. I said yes, because it’s the truth and it would be a trivial thing to lie about, but that it’s not a big deal. John asked if Cody was attracted to me and again I said yes, and that Cody and I are pretty open with each other about that kind of thing but that it’s not a big deal and nothing would never happen. John told me that he was uncomfortable with the fact that I still hung out with him, and that Cody was probably trying to fuck me. I tried to explain that we’d been friends for years and that he was really trivializing a good thing because of one insignificant detail, but he basically said that Cody has a history of sleeping with a lot of girls (true) and that he probably only wanted sex from me. I got mad, because Cody’s a great dude, and yeah he gets around but only with single women who also only want casual sex. It’s not like he goes around lying to women or sleeping with people who are in committed relationships, and he completely respects that I don’t view sex the same way as him and supports my relationship. John basically acted like I don’t understand men and said that he wasn’t comfortable with me hanging out with Cody anymore because I was clearly too naive to see what’s going on. I said that he has no right to tell me who I can and can’t be friends with, and he told me I was being insensitive about his feelings. AITA?

4391,Not the A-hole,"In 2015 I rented an apartment for $3350 a month with a $3350 security deposit. She was a less than stellar LL often taking days to respond. She had me pay rent directly to an out of the way bank, and I was once late when he wouldn't accept a postdated check while I was away. I sent it in but was charged a $200 late fee. She never gave me an electric bill, but after the first 6 months, she sent one for $1800. I started writing my checks for $3500 so $150 would cover it. Over 4 years I helped them out by fixing things myself in order to save them the hassle and hoping my kindness would be paid forward.

As per the lease, I expressed my intent to leave within the allotted time and they accepted my notice to move by August 9th. I had it professionally cleaned with the carpets. I was told that I had to have the parking spaces cleaned for oil spots. Although there was no notice in the lease regarding this, it was easier to have it done for $100.

Upon final inspection we met, and I submitted all receipts and the keys. She mentions that there  were missed oil spots in the parking stall and it would have to be re-cleaned. She then asked me questions about damage that was there before I moved in. I explained it was on the pre-inspection checklist. There was also a stubborn stain on the carpet that didn't get out 100%. She asked me repeatedly if I had an animal and if it was urine from a dog. I politely explained I have never had any pets there.

I have moved many states away and in the last month have received many texts and e-mails asking me about a pet and describing very minimal damages. I told her I had no pets and those items were damaged prior. Of course, I cannot inspect these items now.

Last week I received a letter, saying she forgot to mention there was over $3000 of unpaid electricity and that they had to fix items they re-cleaned some things (with costs but no receipt). None of this was mentioned when we were in the apartment. There were no receipts and the estimates had no cost. Also not mentioned were my 3+ years of paying an extra $150 for electricity.

I came from a very renter friendly state and the laws are written as such. A few examples are: 1. Notice of any withheld money must be sent or delivered on or before the 14th day after expiration. 2. Any work done or money to be collected must be accompanied by receipts. 3. If there was estimated work to be done, it must have an amount.

In regard to these issues, 1. The notice was postmarked August 24th, and since the lease ended on the 9th, the 24th would be considered the 15th day. 2. No receipts were given for work done or the electricity. 3. The estimated work was left blank.

WIBTA to demand all of my deposit back? The law is clear about notice on or before the 14th day. The law allows me to sue for 3x the deposit plus court costs. She was fairly apathetic when things needed to be done and accused me of things that didn't happen which bothers me still.

14528,No A-holes here,"TL;DR - My daughter is spoiled and doesn't know the value of a dollar. We're thinking of 

My daughter is 13, almost 14 - let's call her Tara. I've come to realize that she is somewhat spoiled. We (my husband and I) are very well off and have given her a good lifestyle; throughout her and her sibling's childhoods, we made sure to make sure our children know that they are very lucky and that we will not provide for them forever. However, it seems that Tara doesn't quite understand the value of a dollar yet and refuses to recognize how much of a privilege it is to have a huge house in a safe neighborhood, private schooling, a cellphone, etc. 

I haven't yet given a punishment to her yet, but it is on the table (and she knows it). For the past few months, she's been acting like a spoiled brat. In February, she destroyed a very nice dress we bought for a school dance and was mad because ""It's not like you guys can't afford another one."" For that, we made her do extra chores as a mock job until she repaid the value of the dress (and she did not get another). In March, Tara complained to her father that she didn't want him to drop her off at school anymore because it isn't as expensive and fancy as the others in the car lot (he drives a 2013ish Volvo and her friend's parents have Jaguars and BMWs); she had to walk 2 miles to everyday for a week for that. 

This past Thursday was the worst offence yet. I'm still seething. She was being foolish at school and somehow broke her phone AND someone else's. Now, the other girl in question is a close friend of Tara's, so I don't suspect any bullying, but I am still enraged at how she handled the situation. She apparently told her friend not to worry because we (her father and I) would pay for it. We had a nice, long chat about this last night about what happened; after a little digging, I realized Tara just isn't appreciative of what her father and I have provided her with. We've had multiple discussions about it, but I don't feel she truly gets it.

So far we have 3 options:

* Take away her phone and other expensive tech away for the next month. 

* Have her get a job doing yardwork/babysitting around the neighborhood until she can pay the equivalent of her phone bill

* Have her spend the summer at an uncle's house in a middle class neighborhood close to an impoverished area, where she'll do volunteer service at the local shelter every week. She will also have to have a job.

The last one is the most brutal, as it means she can't go on a girls trip with her BFFs - a (very expensive) trip she's gone on every summer for the past 2-3 years. I'm definitely a proponent of it, however, as she NEEDS to know how lucky she is and MUST gain some real world knowledge (considering my husband and I will only cover college tuition, not anything else, after she leaves the nest). My husband, however, feels it is a little cruel; he feels like we would have to ease her into conditions that ""shocking.""",420,1389,0.97,WIBTA if I were to prevent my daughter from going on a summer trip as punishment?,bck1a5,2019-04-12 22:58:59,NAH,2975,WIBTA
21846,Asshole,"My older daughter is now 31 and my younger daughter is 27.

4 years ago, my older daughter's fiance left her for my younger daughter a month before their wedding.

Yes, it is as terrible as it sounds. Made even worse by the fact that my younger daughter was 2 months along in her pregnancy.

I was extremely disappointed in my younger daughter. They both claimed they were in love and are still married till now.

It literally destroyed our family. My older daughter has banned her sister from coming around her. Which everyone has been accommodating all these years. It makes holidays very stressful but it is what it is.

I've tried my best to have a good relationship with my grandchild while navigating the family issues.

My older daughter has made very cruel comments about my grandchild which I've ignored. That's a mistake on my part for not shutting it down.

In February, my older daughter dropped by our house unexpectedly and encountered my younger daughter, son in law and grandchild.

It was very tense and and my younger daughter broke down in tears and tried apologizing again and revealed to us that my grandchild was likely on the autism spectrum.

And my oldest daughter immediately replied by saying that it's sad that the karma of cheating parents is inflicted on the children. And that maybe this will be a lesson for my younger daughter.

My son in law and my oldest daughter got into a huge fight and everyone left in tears.

I've always been sympathetic to my older daughter and have usually taken her side. But I think what she's said is extremely out of line and mean.

I told her that what she's said was unacceptable and that she needs to apologize or I will not be having her over anymore.

She then told me that my parenting is atrocious and it's no wonder my younger daughter turned out to be a ""bad word""

I've clearly messed up somewhere to have raised two daughters who've made such cruel judgments. 

But am I wrong for taking a stand on this issue?

Both my daughters were lovely people with a lot of success. But our whole family is so angry and sad now. My oldest daughter is the complete opposite of who she used to be.

4165,Not the A-hole,"A friend of mine is going through a divorce and had nowhere to go. Since she has a 1 year old child, and a dog she claims is her ESA, I offered her a room at my place. It was going to work out PERFECTLY because my fiance went to jail shortly after she moved in (nothing bad, he was just dumb and didn't pay tickets) and I prefer having someone around. I told her not to pay me with the first check she got after moving so her and her kid could get settled but after that, her rent to me would be $300/month (which included utilities and internet) and she agreed. Well, her second check came around and because she decided to go to a used car dealership instead of using my fiance's car (I don't drive), she suddenly didn't have money for ANY portion of her rent. Plus she also just HAD to buy a washer and dryer (which I bought hoses for), so she felt the need to pay that person back.

Fine, I can understand that, I use the washer and dryer too. Then she started leaving lights on, doors unlocked, all that. I would tell her about it and she would always say that it was an accident because she leaves in a hurry (which is true). Then she needed help with a few groceries so she can take lunches to her job and promised to pay me back. Then her dog started eating my cats' food and her response to that was ""***your cats can climb, my dog can't, just move the food***"". I ended up just moving their food to the bathroom  where, I hoped, the dog didn't go.

But what broke the deal for me was that I was always the one taking care of the dog when I got home from work, which wasn't enough out of the day. I get a message from my landlady with a screenshot saying that the dog was up all night while I was gone HOWLING and it kept the neighbors awake. My landlady also knows that I don't have any animals on my lease yet. I had to tell her that the dog would be gone so I wouldn't risk eviction. I told my friend about it, she got FURIOUS, and said that she would just have to ""move the f\*\*\* out"".

Now she posts these super passive aggressive messages on Facebook and I know they're about me.

15428,Everyone Sucks,"A coworker always talks about how she needs emotional support for anxiety and shit like that. She’s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here’s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. 

So she gets the puppy, and can’t really train it because she’s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. 

Now she’s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic “Give the dog to an owner who can care for it”. And man did I get attacked. It’s a “therapy dog”, it’s a “getting her through a tough time”. My reply was “She should try Netflix, it won’t piss itself and die while she’s away”. 

Well, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I’ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I’ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something.

22294,Not the A-hole,"When my bf and I first started dating I was experiencing some mental health troubles related to my childhood/a past relationship.

He met a guy online I’ll call Roger. Roger and he immediately hit it off and very quickly I was introduced to him as well. Roger introduced himself to me as a mental health specialist and started questioning me about my past.

I was obviously very reluctant to speak with him about anything — I’d just met the guy. But my BF thought that Roger would be able to ‘help’ me. I told him I already had a therapist/psychiatrist for that. BF thought they weren’t helping me enough. Finally he says unless I speak to Roger he is breaking up with me because ‘I won’t help myself’.
I speak with Roger. He starts asking about my history with therapists and I don’t say much. I mention most of my trauma I just laugh off (I often use it to cope) he twisted this into I was laughing at therapists and wasting their time.

He convinces my BF I am a psychopath because I laugh at my trauma, and twists him around so my BF calls me begging I let Roger help me. I refuse all of it, but again my BF says he won’t talk to me if I won’t help myself.

Roger calls me up later and I tell him it is people like him that manipulate people that suffer from mental illness to the point they get even worse. It seemed to me all he was trying to do was deliberately sabotage the progress I’d made. He says I shouldn’t have said that and threatens to call the police on me. I refuse to give him my address, so he says he will call them on my BF instead (evidently my BF gave him his address and paid him a considerable sum of money to ‘help’ me)

My BF blocked me for 3 days and during that time I found out that Roger wasn’t who he said he was. He was lying about his qualifications and had no mental health training. It all came to an end when Roger called my parents and tried to extort them for money for ‘treatment’ as well. My parents who are ex-police saw him as a con man, and my mom showed up at my apt the next day and went with me to my actual therapist to talk about everything.

I wanted to report Roger to the cops for impersonating a mental health professional and attempting to extort my family and loved ones for money, but my BF begged me not to because he still saw Roger as a friend.

AITA for wanting to report him to the police? He still runs a semi-popular discord server to this day as far as I know, and I have no idea how many others he may have affected in this way. My BF has apologized for his part in everything, but still thinks Roger was actually trying to help me and I was the asshole for threatening to get authorities involved. He also said Roger always said I was ‘vindictive ’.

TL;DR BF doesn’t want me to report conman to the police that attempted to sabotage my mental health and our relationship because he still thinks the guy had good intentions.

This happened when me and a friend of mine were at mall's food court. There was a new Shawarma outlet that had opened and of course i wanted to try it out. I went to the stall, gave my order and paid the salesperson the money and waited in front of the stall till my order was ready. I expected the lady to slice off chunks off the rotisserie and wrap it. Instead, she went inside her pantry and brought out some chunks of chicken and heated them in the microwave. I was obviously pissed. I went to stall and asked her Wtf she is doing and said that I wanted fresh Shawarma off the rotisserie and not whatever she brought from the pantry!

Following were her reasons for not giving me freshly cut pieces:

It's not economical for them for turn the rotisserie on and off every time they get an order so they do it just twice a day

That's how they usually do it

Nobody has ever complained about this (it's a relatively new shop)

As I was walking into the store, there was a lone cart that someone just left. I sped up to it, and rested my hand on the handle. I always like to clean it with a disinfecting wipe that the store has a dispenser of, so I turned my back and walked about 5 feet from my cart to get a wipe. When I turn around, a man in his 50s sniped my cart. As a note, I am a man in my 30s. 

I saw it happen and said excuse me sir that was my cart. He said “there was no one here when I got here so it’s mine actually” and shrugged and walked away. I was extremely annoyed because there was no carts. I also anticipated a large order so I needed a cart and a basket would not be sufficient 

I decided to follow the man around the store. He began to put items in the cart. When he got to an aisle, he turned his back, walked about 20 feet away to look at something. I saw this as an opportunity.. he had maybe 5 items in the cart, all small food items. I took the cart and began to walk backwards. He turned around and began screaming at me.

5418,No A-holes here,"It would be after the actual wedding. My twin brother and his girlfriend are getting married in Paris on 31/8. Me and my girlfriend of 3 years are taking the eurostar there on 29/8, as are a lot of our family and mutual friends. After the wedding, on 1/9 the newlyweds are heading to the South of France for their honeymoon, but me, my girlfriend, my parents, and a few friends have decided (separately) to stay a couple extra days. Me and my girlfriend don't leave until 5/9, our friends leave the day before, my parents leave the day after.

I've asked her about proposing and she said she'd love for me to propose, and she'd say yes, and we agreed to a public proposal. She loves cliches and thinks Paris is really romantic, but she doesn't think I'll propose any time soon (I asked in a way where it could be any time).

I want to take her to the Eiffel Tower on 3/9, just the two of us, and pop the question. I want to do it on that date specifically as our friends and family will all still be in Paris, and she's said she would want to tell them as soon as it happened.

However, this would mean doing it literally 3 days after my brother's wedding. IDK if that's the best idea, but the only reason we can go to Paris is that my parents are paying for everything, IDK when we'll next be able to go.

WIBTA?

EDIT: I asked my brother and he just said ""your proposal, up to you"" but IDK if that actually means he's alright with it. It kind of reminds me of that line in Jurassic Park ""your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could that they didn't stop to think if they should""

Also: my girlfriend and I got together in Paris. We went with some friends (including the ones who will be in Paris on the date), at some point on the first trip we got drunk and admitted we liked each other. We went there as friends and left in a relationship, and had our first date at a cafe near the Eiffel Tower. Admittedly not the most romantic story but it's ours, and proposing in the same place feels right. If we'd gotten together back in England I'd still have gone wherever we had our first date to propose. My brother and his bride have never been. I know they're getting married there but if it's anyone's ""place"", it's ours. Didn't want to say this in case people think I'm trying to reclaim it or some shit, but now people are saying it's my brother and his bride's place, so doing anything there would lose significance to them, and while I know we can't ""claim"" a city, if either couple gets Paris it's just not my brother.

For everyone saying we're already engaged: I asked my girlfriend if when I propose she'd want a public or private proposal and if she'd want it to be a surprise. She said it was my call. I want to take her back to where we got together to propose, so my choices are either the Eiffel tower or a room in a youth hostel, and the tower feels like the more romantic option.

However, the commute is nothing compared to having to live in the dorm and I've even come to enjoy it, so having to move out 6 months prematurely is not even my primary concern.

The first red flag was on move-in day when I asked about her shower schedule and she shrugged and said, ""Oh, you know, whenever I remember to."" I didn't think much of it but as this year has progressed, I have never once seen her go into the bathroom and hear water running, come out with wet hair, or wash her bed sheets. The BO is more noticeable when she's in the room so I try to go there when she's not.

She also has a habit of bringing food into the room and letting it sit for months (there's a bowl of squash that has been sitting there since winter). I bought our mini-fridge at her request and I hardly ever use it. She lets food go bad in there and when I ask her to eat it faster, she tells me she'll ""eat it at whatever pace I want."" The pinnacle of this was me throwing out her spoiled food in December as she had already left for winter break and her yelling at me over text about it.

Another side-note: she keeps an empty bottle of parmesan cheese in her bed. She tucks the thing in like it's her child and one time, I saw it on the ground and said, ""You dropped something"" and she scrambled out of bed to grab it and tucked it back in.

For anyone who thinks I should go to my RA, I don't because my RA is the most antisocial guy I've ever met. He's nice but his entire vibe tells me he wants to interact with other people as little as possible and I'd also like to interact with my roommate as little as possible which would not happen if he had us talk things out.

This morning, after a bad night's sleep, I went back to my room to see if I could nap but she was there. The godawful smell hit me like a freight train. I couldn't be in the room without feeling like I was going to vomit. I asked a friend to come over and he agreed with me, saying ""It's not even something words can describe."" Later, I texted her asking her to shower and she told me, verbatim, to ""fuck right off"".

Even though I can't stand her, I've tried keeping things civil and she basically has had a single room this whole year. But I feel like it's gone too far. My bf suggested we take the mini-fridge back to his place as we could actually use it, but she seems mentally unstable frankly, and I'm worried she would go off at me and that it's too extreme.

8761,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for reasons.

So basically, I have a friend that I met online that I've known for about 5 years now. Recently I got a new job and I make pretty decent money for once. Me and this friend has been wanting to meet up for quite some time, and I managed to find a good deal on a flight/hotels so I flew out to Texas from California yesterday morning. 

First day/night went good explored the city, got some food, had some drinks/sex. But, today is basically what's pissing me the hell off. Friend claims she'll be back because she needs to fill her gas tank, and she wants me to stay back and watch her dog. That's fine, gas station is nearby should take what 10-15 minutes tops? Thanks to Snapchat having that creepy feature where you can see on the map where your friends are (I recommend opting-out if you like privacy, or are going to lie to somebody about your whereabouts.) I pretty much got curious/concerned where she was at because 30 minutes passed, not answering calls or text. So looked her up on the map. Saw that she's basically is on the waaaaaay other side of the city at someone's apartment. 

I'm in a bit of a moral dilemma because, well I don't want to abandon her dog. But, I'm also just really debating on saying fuck this shit and just up and leave. It just rubs me the wrong way that I basically spent all this money to fly out to Texas to spend time with a friend, and get basically ditched on my last full day in the state. Especially because I've been sitting up in this hotel alone basically. Honestly, I could've stayed my ass in California and did that for way cheaper. 

Basically, the room isn't in my name and if I do leave the dog (which I don't want to do) she'll be financially responsible for any damage, or mess the dog makes. Been left alone for roughly 5 hours with no contact. So, would I be an asshole if I just up and left without saying anything?",70,130,0.94,WIBTA If I ditched my friend?,ccw4mb,2019-07-13 23:36:54,NTA,1895,WIBTA
3001,No A-holes here,"To preface, I am a Buddhist, and while avoiding animal products is not required by my faith, for me, it is an important aspect of my practice of it. My avoidance of alcohol dates back to when I was thirteen, and my then sixteen year-old brother had to have his stomach pumped. My family and friends are well aware of both. 

Moving to the matter itself, every year, my hosts a large Halloween party. Usually, there are around two hundred guests in attendance. For a variety of reasons, my parents are unable to host the event this year, and they asked me to do so in their stead. 

When they asked, I said I would be willing, but I immediately reminded them of my beliefs and avoidance of both alcohol and animal products and how I did not think I would be a suitable host because of them. They said it would be fine. Earlier today, my mother called me. I had emailed her the menu and guest list for final approval. She was furious. 

Apparently, I was unclear when I said I was uncomfortable. My parents thought that when I agreed, I agreed to serve meat and alcohol. They are saying it will be a huge issue at the party. 

I once again suggested having someone else plan it, but, as they pointed out, it’s less than a month away from the party. We really don’t have time for someone else to take over the planning. I don’t want to compromise my beliefs for this event, but I also don’t want to disappoint my parents or their guests.

4600,Asshole,"My boyfriend has had trouble with his skin for a long time. In particular, shaving leaves his skin severely irritated. When I met him, he had a very rough beard, which he said he kept to avoid shaving. About a year ago he started a white-collar job which meant he had to shave it off. Since then shaving has been a pretty bad experience for him. Every morning he goes to work with a very bad red neck and face. He started to shave in the shower at my direction and that helps a little, but it’s still pretty bad. 

A few months ago, his birthday was coming up. I am really bad at buying presents, and was pumped when I thought I had figured out the perfect present. I had done some research and bought him exfoliate, a razor for sensitive skin and some other shaving-relating products to round it all out. I was excited to finally be proud of a present I got for him.

His birthday was last week, and it turns out exfoliating and this new razor doesn’t entirely fix his issues, but helps immensely. He was absolutely ecstatic and said it was the best present he had ever received, and he felt he could finally move past the discomfort and embarrassment of having inflamed skin every day.

While he was thanking me, I told him that I had been holding onto that present for three months and had been dying to give it to him the whole time, and that at times I had almost broken and given it to him early. Upon hearing I had it for months, he suddenly turned.

He has been furious with me the last week and we just can’t agree on who is at fault here – our friends/family are equally split so I’m interested to hear Reddit’s take. 

His perspective is that I have been allowing him to suffer for my own benefit. He seems particularly mad about that fact that every morning he complains about his skin and for three months I’ve had the “option to fix it” and decided not to so I could maximise my own gratification. He thinks it’s the equivalent of if I had, for example, terrible back pains and he stumbled on a pill that would fix it, bought it and then decided to wait three months to give it to me while watching me suffer every day.

I think that’s a pretty big exaggeration. I do see where he is coming from, but I feel like he is being very ungrateful for a well thought out present. I just wanted to bring him happiness on his birthday and didn’t feel like it was so serious that waiting was immoral. He is so difficult to buy presents for, and I had finally figured something out and if I gave it to him early I’d be left at square one and faced with the likelihood of disappointing him.

12084,Asshole,"My wife has never gone to the gym seriously. Closest thing to it was highschool where girls would hate it and do the bare minimum. Her goal is to gain muscle, mostly in the lower ass and legs. I've been a gym buff ever since highschool, about 6 years. I agreed to help her and go with her. This is already a sacrifice I'm willing to make since teaching can take lots of time out of my workout and I have to accommodate when I go to when she wants to go. The first week went fine. I was perhaps too instructiony and threw alot at once on her but other than that it went well. Today we decided to go kinda separately since my aim isn't on getting my ass bigger but we did do some stuff together. While we were separate I noticed she only did 1 set of lunges so I asked just to make sure how many sets she had already done to which she said 1. I laughed and told her the point is to aim for 3 or 4 sets and to exhaust the muscles. She told me she only did 1 because last time she only did 4 reps for a set and did 3 sets. This time she did 20 reps and 1 set. This led to sets vs reps confusion and me telling her again that the point is not to get the reps out of the way but rather exhaust the muscles. So she does her remaining sets then we do an exercise together. We start doing dumbbell squats. She does her sets but takes very little rest in-between sets. I asked how many reps she's doing and I tell her to take more rest in between sets to allow her to do more reps. She looks at me and laughs and says this isn't the Olympics. That's when I finally ignore her I do the rest of my workout and give her minimal help only if she asks. When we get home we talk about it she tells me I'm overreacting and that it's not that big of a deal. I try to explain why I wanted her to rest more and how it's better my way, given her goal of putting on muscle and she says I don't think so. I tell her to trust me and that I know more than her at this stuff. Honestly, I do. I have 6 years of experience and she just started. She says she'll just do it her way to which I reply well what's the point of me going to the gym with you and helping you if you know just as much? I tell her I don't want to do it if shes not gonna listen. We both try to get our points across and are yelling. My point is basically if you just listen to why I'm telling you to do thingsy way it might make more sense and if you don't want to then I don't see why I need to be there with you. Her point is basically I shouldn't get so worked up over one small detail and to just get over it and not start am argument over it. She gets emotional at me and while she's blending her protein shake in the blender its not blending very good and she storms off into the room and locks it.

3588,Not the A-hole,"The backstory: I love my niece, I really do, but she can be a real handful. She's cost myself and my partner thousands of dollars in damage to our property (pouring stuff down the dry cleaner vent, holes in the walls, broken phones, smashing heirlooms, etc). I understand you have to watch young kids, but I do. I even get criticised for keeping a close eye on them. And the majority of the damage has been done when her parents were present.

We had to look after her for 2 weeks. We discussed with her parents ahead of time about this issue and cleared it with them that, if she broke something, she would ""work it off"" in an age appropriate way.

&#x200B;

It wasn't long before she broke a few things, including cutting up a stress ball and hiding the evidence. It wasn't worth much to us, but could have been toxic if our pets had found it before we did. We had her sweep the bathroom floor (she did an amazing job), clean the walls near the light switches, and the last job was to clean the toilet.

&#x200B;

The toilet situation: Absolutely NO harsh chemicals like bleach were used, I'm allergic to them. While my partner was putting on gloves for her, I did a thorough clean of the toilet, including sanitising the seat. I switched out the toilet brush for a clean and unused one afterwards. Her cleaning amounted to us pouring in the toilet cleaner, her bobbing the brush up and down a few times, and a single wipe of the seat. We gave her calm guidance, and monitored her the whole time, including for any sign of distress. She was apprehensive at first, but handled it like a pro! Afterwards she was so proud of herself, we praised her, and thought it went well.

&#x200B;

The aftermath: She told her parents that she learnt how to clean a toilet. They blew up. We couldn't explain that it was clean, no bleach, that it wasn't out of anger. They said it was child abuse.

I got really upset that I could have hurt her without realising it. I went onto parenting sites to see age appropriate chores. All I could find on cleaning toilets is that it shouldn't be for ages <10 if harsh chemicals are used, given the danger there. Now I'm confused and upset. I had thought that it went well, we were able to drop the issue without anger or frustration, she took a lot more care of our stuff afterwards, and she seemed really proud and happy with herself. For all her issues, she is a sweet and caring kid. I don't want to hurt her.",43,31,0.95,AITA for making my 6 year old niece clean the toilet?,d8gep1,2019-09-24 01:41:27,NTA,2439,AITA
14880,Asshole,"My girlfriend and I are in our early 20’s and have been together for 6 months. A few days ago she found out she was selected as a Fulbright finalist and will be moving to Europe in August for 10 months. I’m extremely proud of her and I’m happy that she’s fulfilling her dreams but I can’t help but feel a little sad that she’s leaving. I’ve been trying my best to keep those feelings contained and to just be happy for her but it’s been a little difficult and I’ve sort of been distant with her these past few days. 

Last night we were at a bar celebrating this girls birthday party but also kind of celebrating my girlfriends huge achievement. Long story short, she started posting on Instagram and Snapchat right next to me about how she’ll be living in Europe in a few months and will meet one of her friends in Paris. I didn’t say anything but having her flaunt that in my face when she knows it’s a sensitive subject brought down my mood and made me shut down. She then went to the bathroom so I got on my phone for a little bit and was still on it when she came back because I was reading something. Admittedly, I didn’t really feel like talking at that moment and the phone was my escape but I couldn’t have been on there for more then 5 minutes after she came back. She then told me I looked miserable and to go home if I was having such a bad time. I told her I wasn’t having a bad time and I was here for her. I questioned why she was upset and she kept telling me to just go home because I looked miserable but I said no. She said she was leaving and Ubering home then and as I followed her out of the bar she kept turning around telling me to stop following her. She got in her Uber outside and called out to me saying “BABE” implying she wanted me to follow her and get in the car but I just said “No, I’m not going with you” so she gave me the middle finger and took off. That last bit made me upset and I texted her afterwards asking what the problem was and said that this wasn’t some game where she runs away and I immediately go chasing after her. She said I looked miserable when I was on my phone and humiliated her because I couldn’t even hold a conversation. Today we talked about it more and she says that she’s incredibly hurt because it’s unfair for her to have to censor her excitement around me. She says my excitement for her isn’t genuine and that I say all the right things but don’t mean them. She says she understands that I’m sad but if the roles were reversed she would at least make sure I felt celebrated and excited first and foremost and that after the celebration we would start having those conversations about how she’s feeling. In response I said, “If it was me getting a huge award I would like to celebrate with you but I would try to avoid flaunting it in your face until we’ve really talked about it. I’d know that something this big is obviously a good thing but it affects you too as my girlfriend so I’d try to be aware of your feelings.”

After dinner, I took a walk with my GF. When we got back to the room, my brother and sister were on one bed. He was sleeping and she was playing with her Switch. I asked her nicely if she could stay on the other bed beside my GF so I could stay beside my brother. She said no. 

We grew up in a Catholic family. This means no sex before marriage, and I would rather not sleep on the same bed as my GF to avoid temptation. So I was hoping my sister would understand.

* a lesbian but not exactly interested in having a relationship with anyone

So I’m super in to baking. I find it fun, plus I get a little snack at the end of it. My sister is gluten sensitive, so must of the stuff I make, she can’t eat. 

My mom told me a while back that I should start making stuff for her. There are a few reasons why I don’t want to do that. 

1. Most of the stuff I make is my first time making it. My logic is that if I change the recipe and it comes out bad, I won’t know if it was something I was doing, the gluten free ingredients, or the recipe.

I didn't mind, I like that he likes my cooking/baking, so I just started to make double batches. One batch with my recipes usually makes between 10 and 14 of whatever it is (cookies, muffins, cupcakes, ect), which is around 2 a day for me, so double batches means between 20 and 28 of whatever it is. However, I've noticed that I'm still running out before the end of the week, which means he's having more than 2 a day. I've never approached this with him, as I know that when he's stressed he tends to overeat and he's got a lot going on right now.

I decided to make cupcakes earlier this week, and I made a chocolate cupcake base, but then I split the batter in two, and flavoured one with chilli and the other with mint. My boyfriend loves chilli, but I hate it, and I love mint, but he hates it. To differentiate, both flavours were coloured and then marbled. The mint chocolate cake was a visible swirl of dark brown chocolate cake and bright green mint cake. The chilli was a mix of dark brown and vivid red. When I was done there were maybe 10 mint chocolate and 20 chilli chocolate. Didn't actually count, so that's an estimate.

I figured those would last him until my next baking day, a week from that day, but it's been 4 days and he's already polished off all 20 cupcakes. Tonight, in a way that was not rude or angry or anything like that, he started talking about the cupcakes, asking me to make more of the chilli but not to make the mint ones again because he hates mint. I responded that I was going to make both because I don't like chilli. He then realised I made those cupcakes specifically for him.

What happened from there was a conversation where was asking me why I went out of my way to make two different batches of cupcakes, one he likes and one he hates, and eventually I admitted that I made those because I figured he'd eat the chilli and leave the mint chocolate alone. He asked why I did it like that and I said, in the nicest way possible, that he'd been getting through them pretty quickly lately and I wanted to make sure I had some for lunch.

\#He then got upset, saying that if he was overeating I should have said something, and I said, also getting upset, that I'm not about to start a log of what he eats. I said I'd noticed he gets through the baking I made pretty quickly, I wanted to make sure he had something he liked, and I liked that he liked my baking, but I also wanted to set some stuff aside for myself, and I didn't mean for it to start an argument. He replied that I was babying him, especially by making stuff that he would eat and stuff he wouldn't. He said that I might as well have held them out of his reach for all the dignity I left him.

10010,Not the A-hole,"This is extremely petty and the title makes me sound vain, I know...

I have very thick, coarse, and curly hair. It's not often that I straighten it, but I do when I want to switch things up and it makes trimming easier. I usually do my hair by myself but this time my mother kept insisting that she do it for me, but I refused. The reason why is because she's not the most patient person and you really need to take your time when it comes to hair like mine. She also doesn't like my hair texture and has tried to talk me into chemically straightening it multiple times, so I figured zero patience and a negative attitude would only makes things worse. I was about a quarter of the way done when she came into my room and said she wanted to try something with my hair. I asked her what she wanted to do and she didn't tell me; she just repeated that she wants to ""experiment"" with something.  My hair has been extremely damaged in the past. I put a lot of time and effort into nursing it back to health, so I don't really like the words ""try"" and ""experiment"" like my hair is some kind of toy or template to do whatever with it.

At this point I didn't have a choice, and she took over. I saw her put some oil in her hands and I immediately turned around and asked her not to apply oil as it will fry my hair and will make it stiff. Once again, she said she just wants to ""try"" something with it and did it anyway. I saw her pull out the flat iron and I realized she didn't use my heat protectant spray. I asked if she used it and she said yes. I asked if she was sure, and she said ""Just sit there and be quiet"", and proceeded to flat iron my hair with just oil. She liked the result, and I said I don't feel comfortable putting oil on my hair before using a flat iron and she said, ""Well I like it"" and then continued to do what she was doing.

As time went on, I noticed she was putting these giant, old Hollywood style curls in my hair, and I said I didn't want that, I just want my hair to be plain straight. Then the situation escalated and she started saying I was being a brat for making all these demands. She said she offered to do my hair ""out of the goodness of her own heart"" and that I was being ungrateful for making a bunch of criticisms. In my opinion, it's no longer out of the goodness of your heart if you're forcing someone to accept your help, and then forcing that same someone to accept your version of helping.

So I am a nurse, currently on a string of nights, my husband is a stay at home dad. This is a new job and I've been late several times recently because of accidents on the way. What's usually a 25minute journey can take up to an hour and a half!

I checked the traffic this evening and was ready to go 1h20m before my shift, getting me there 10 minutes early. My husband was out, and I couldn't find my car keys anywhere. When I called him he said he'd had them earlier but couldn't remember what he did with them. He was on his way home but didnt get there for half an hour, only to discover the keys were in his pocket and he didnt even apologise. I was fuming and called him a fucking idiot. I hate being late and this is a new job where I'm trying to make a good impression. He said I was over-reacting and I think I told him to fuck off.

In the end I was only about 10 minutes late as the traffic had cleared a bit, but it's still late and doesnt look good. He has texted me now to apologise but I've left him on read. AITA?

Backstory: I have three teenagers and they are all GOOD. Like, they talk to me, don’t lie or sneak etc. (that I know of, of course, but I’m pretty sure). We have very open relationships, they are good students, have jobs, talk to me if they are going to a party where people are drinking etc and never ever drive under the influence. I have a full time job and sometimes we don’t connect until nighttime. 

So. I love having them on location services for a couple of reasons. First of all, i don’t want to be a helicopter parent who says “where are you” all the time. A quick check lets me know my son is at work or my daughter is at a friend’s house and then I don’t bother them. No calls or texts, all is well. I also think about how fast we move around and if something bad happened I’d be able to find them ASAP. One of my kids was in a car accident and I was able to get there immediately without having to ask for directions. Another kid went off to college and it gives me so much pleasure to see him in another city without getting in his face and asking what he’s doing. It makes me feel connected without bothering him.

18613,Not the A-hole,"My first time writing a reddit post bear with me. My husband(Harry)’s brother(Adam) has been lying for the past week about having memory loss. I’ve know Adam for 12 years and he’s done nothing but lie cheat and steal from EVERYONE around him including Harry.

Backstory...
Two weeks ago Adam had an infection in the skin on his chin from a haircut. Not a big deal he cleared it with antibiotics. After he was seen in the ER and came home he started saying he had memory loss. I’m a nurse and I’ve talked to other nurses and his infection wouldn’t have led to memory loss unless it spread to his brain which is a very serious he also is not showing any symptoms of this being an issue.

Adam has been telling his family he’s suffering from short term memory loss but he’s showing them symptoms of long term...idiot! He conveniently doesn’t remember me(because I don’t like him and won’t believe his lies. Also because I’m a nurse and would be able to tell he’s lying), he doesn’t remember the girl he recently cheated on his children mother with even though he lived with her for a year prior to this past week,he doesn’t remember getting tickets while driving and saying he’s Harry(which we have a court case for but it’s been postponed because of what’s happening in our world)


I finally told my husband that his brother was lying and although upset we set out to find out the truth. We had a list of the lies we caught him in about having memory loss. Harry was supposed to go to a doctors appointment with Adam to catch him in a lie but Adam didn’t answer his calls or text messages. Adam has their mother call Harry and ask him not to come to the doctors appt.(which we’ve realized was a lie) Long story short lol Harry ended up telling him and Adams mother that Adam is lying. The mother argued against it at first but now she sees that he was lying. The mother tells Adams children’s mother that we think he’s lying.

367,Asshole,"About a year ago, my younger son (14M) came out as gay.

My wife and I have no problem whatsoever with this and neither does my older son (16M). My brother on the other hand was not happy at this news. Me, him and my sister grew up in a relatively conservative community and he still reflects that. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, he is homophobic. He doesn't like the thought of same sex relationships one single bit. I never tried to confront him about this, even though I disagree with him on it, until I found out about my son. However, it's clear I am not going to change his mind about it.

While I'm sad that he thinks like that, he is family and I want to keep in contact with him. My son however said a few months ago that he wants me to cut him off and said that he basically feels that by keeping in contact with my brother I am not valuing him as a person. I understand why he doesn't want anything to do with my brother, and have allowed him to stop coming with us when we visit and stay in his room or go out the house while my brother visits us. But I don't want to tear the family apart over this and lose my relationship with my brother, and also my niece and nephew.

12560,No A-holes here,"Hi all,

Our daughter just graduated from University with a degree in art. We (the parents) work as doctors and always tried to steer our daughter towards a high paying profession but her passion for art throughout school was very strong. When it came time for her to apply to University we told her that we won't pay for tuition if she studies something that doesn't have a good rate of return. She borrowed around $150k (NZD) of student loans to do her art degree and now she has a job that pays significantly less than the average wage doing some casual painting for small studios and her overall prospects don't look good - almost 100% of her paycheque goes on a rented apartment that she shares with two other people.

We haven't told her, but we're going to pay off her student loan debt this year so she can be debt free.

We (parents) want to sell our house and leave the country, we're looking at moving from New Zealand to Europe so we can enjoy skiing in the winter and french vineyards in the summer. We're in our 50's now so we feel like we've earned the right to start enjoying our lives rather than continuing to live in the city.

Our daughter recently asked if she could move back in with us in order to reduce her living expenses, we told her that we are planning on moving to Europe. She suggested that we let her stay in our house after we leave; we really need to sell the house as we need the money. She is incredibly angry at us for ""abandoning"" her. We feel that as a 22 year old adult, she should be able to take care of herself, we gave her access to the best private schools in the area, the best after school tutors and her grades were A's across all subjects. She chose to live the life of a suffering and poor artist despite us trying to get her interested in medicine, law, business etc. We tried not to push her too hard towards things that she had no interest in but we really did try to show her that art isn't going to let her live the kind of life that she became accustomed to when she lived with us (ski trips, nice houses, restaurants etc).

Are we the assholes?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I just want to point out that we HAVE NOT had an ""I told you so"" moment with her where we make her feel bad for studying art. We love our daughter greatly but we really want to retire and get out of this city living.

&#x200B;

Second edit: looks like I need to add some more context in order to stop the accusations of abusive father. I have supported her passion for art her entire life with every fibre of my being. When she chose her degree and her University, I just sat down with her to look at average salaries over the lifetime of various careers, she still chose art, we supported that choice despite being worried for her. She completely supported us retiring to France, she was excited for us and for all the skiing she would get to do with us. She only got upset when we told her we are selling our house (not her childhood home). She studied at Oxford in the UK, she tried to live in the UK post-grad but couldn't get a good visa due to not securing work with a company that could sponsor her, turns out there's not much demand for what she does.",402,327,0.89,AITA For leaving our daughter without money or anywhere to live?,bp5awk,2019-05-15 23:33:31,NAH,3178,AITA
575,Asshole,"I'm 29, she is 28. My wife had been away visiting her parents for the past 5 days. One night, around 7, I decided to invite a few friends over to our basement. The basement is a great place to hang out in general and we often throw parties there. 

&#x200B;

At around 9:30 I just decided, screw it, lets invite a bunch of friends and throw a little party. About 15-20 people came to the basement and we had a party. Me and my wife casually do this a lot, invite a bunch of people over for a party. I didn't assume it was a big deal. Nobody ever goes upstairs, everything is contained to the basement. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, wife came back 2 days after. Everything was fine and dandy, I didn't even think to tell her about the party because again, I didn't think it was a big deal, and she was already stressed about her parents so I didn't care to tell her about anything here. Then she looked in the garbage outside and saw about a hundred beer cans in there and a bunch of bottles of liquor. She asked me what it was, and I mentioned I had thrown a party in the basement two nights before. She right away got insanely mad at me. Like ""YOU THREW A PARTY IN OUR HOUSE AND DIDNT EVEN TELL ME!!?"" kind of mad. I just told her I was sorry, I didn't think it was a big deal. Then she started getting accusational and asked me why I was throwing an entire party and not telling her, as if I was hiding something. We got over the fight quite a while ago, but I still think about it a lot. 

&#x200B;

If this was actually in the house, like on the first and second floor, that is a big deal. But our basement is just sort of empty except for a couch, a TV, a stationary bike, a punching bag, some boxes with useless shit in them, a tiny bathroom, and... that's really it. Its a huge basement, 90% of it is just empty. There is practically nothing to destroy or even make a mess of. Not to mention we've thrown like 15 parties in the basement before in the past 5 years we've been living here.

7591,Asshole,"I live on a creek and have no yard so I have to walk him to use the bathroom. The creek I live on is not one people swim in or anything, seeing as there is no real bank. It's down about 6 feet from the surface where you walk and there's no way to get down to it, so people don't do anything except walk by it. Also it is lined with trees, which creates a pretty dense foliage of tall grass, kudzu, and other viney messy undergrowth. When the city mows that area, they don't cut or maintain the undergrowth. So it just flourishes like crazy all along the creek. 

My dog has always been the type to hide when he poops so he goes into all the brush to do his business. I don't think I have to clean it up because you can't even see it since it's in all the foliage from the trees and brush that line the creek. Plus, its difficult for a person to even get to it. But the other day someone happened to be walking in the area and was super passive aggressive about how I just walked off after he pooped, but like I said, you can't even see it. There's no way someone would step in it and unless you saw him pooping, you wouldn't even know it was there since he basically burrows into the undergrowth. If he poops outside of the brush, then I always clean it up because people walk there and I'm not a dick. But I don't think I have to when its essentially buried in kudzu and tall grass that you can't even walk into. 

So, am I the asshole?

Edit: okay, so I didn't know dog poop was harmful to the environment. Thank you for pointing that out. I really do appreciate the knowledge. I just thought dog poop was the same as any other animals poop, but it makes sense since they don't have the same diet as wild animals. Also, for those that have mentioned the leash thing, he is always leashed. He just walks into the kudzu patch to do his business. And I do pick up his shit if he goes outside of the kudzu/ undergrowth, I just never did it if he went in that since I didn't think it was a problem because I didn't know it was harmful to the environment.

15324,Not the A-hole,"Best friend and I (both early 30s) have been basically brothers for 20+ years, and him and his wife were together for seven years and married for four. This last year he got a new job which made him very conceited and would go out every weekend with his new workmates who are all...quite misogynistic. I definitely noticed changes in the way he would treat people and pulled away a bit. 

Three months ago he showed up at my place in tears saying he made a big mistake and his wife was leaving him because she found a thong under the bed that wasn’t hers and an email between him the workmates joking about hiring hookers. He swears up and down that he never cheated on her and never would and he was so devastated I had to believe him. His wife left him in the middle of the day without saying a word, just divorce papers and no one knows where she left to. 

He was so broken and spent a lot of time talking to us about it, I know he really loved her and was totally blindsided but the situation also looked so bad from her end. We did our best to comfort and be there for him. A few weeks after all this, he stopped hanging out with us as much and started hanging out with his work friends a lot more. His attitude did a total 180, he wasn’t sad and moping around anymore but cocky. He got on this kick about how she probably elaborately set him up to leave him for another guy and pin all the blame on him because he got his friend to watch her at her work and she was eating her lunch with a guy. He suddenly started dating this new girl - my wife and I were pretty surprised but trying to be supportive asked him about her and he said, verbatim ‘she’s a butterface but always down to bone’. The new girlfriend started posting about them on Instagram in his hot tub that ex wife got him as a wedding gift with a caption that said ‘my hot tub, my man, my house now’ with the laugh emoji. Of course this got back to ex wife and she went absolutely psycho on him, telling him things so terrible I can’t include them in the post, trying to screw him as much as possible in the divorce and selling the hot tub in the middle of the day while he was at work.

5418,No A-holes here,"It would be after the actual wedding. My twin brother and his girlfriend are getting married in Paris on 31/8. Me and my girlfriend of 3 years are taking the eurostar there on 29/8, as are a lot of our family and mutual friends. After the wedding, on 1/9 the newlyweds are heading to the South of France for their honeymoon, but me, my girlfriend, my parents, and a few friends have decided (separately) to stay a couple extra days. Me and my girlfriend don't leave until 5/9, our friends leave the day before, my parents leave the day after.

I've asked her about proposing and she said she'd love for me to propose, and she'd say yes, and we agreed to a public proposal. She loves cliches and thinks Paris is really romantic, but she doesn't think I'll propose any time soon (I asked in a way where it could be any time).

I want to take her to the Eiffel Tower on 3/9, just the two of us, and pop the question. I want to do it on that date specifically as our friends and family will all still be in Paris, and she's said she would want to tell them as soon as it happened.

However, this would mean doing it literally 3 days after my brother's wedding. IDK if that's the best idea, but the only reason we can go to Paris is that my parents are paying for everything, IDK when we'll next be able to go.

WIBTA?

EDIT: I asked my brother and he just said ""your proposal, up to you"" but IDK if that actually means he's alright with it. It kind of reminds me of that line in Jurassic Park ""your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could that they didn't stop to think if they should""

Also: my girlfriend and I got together in Paris. We went with some friends (including the ones who will be in Paris on the date), at some point on the first trip we got drunk and admitted we liked each other. We went there as friends and left in a relationship, and had our first date at a cafe near the Eiffel Tower. Admittedly not the most romantic story but it's ours, and proposing in the same place feels right. If we'd gotten together back in England I'd still have gone wherever we had our first date to propose. My brother and his bride have never been. I know they're getting married there but if it's anyone's ""place"", it's ours. Didn't want to say this in case people think I'm trying to reclaim it or some shit, but now people are saying it's my brother and his bride's place, so doing anything there would lose significance to them, and while I know we can't ""claim"" a city, if either couple gets Paris it's just not my brother.

For everyone saying we're already engaged: I asked my girlfriend if when I propose she'd want a public or private proposal and if she'd want it to be a surprise. She said it was my call. I want to take her back to where we got together to propose, so my choices are either the Eiffel tower or a room in a youth hostel, and the tower feels like the more romantic option.

20712,Asshole,"My (f23) parents got divorced when I was 12. My mother moved my younger brother and I to her boyfriend's home in a different city and we'd visit my Dad on weekends. A few years later my Dad married my stepmother who told Dad that the custody arrangement was unfair to him and he should get it formalized in court so he'd have more time with us. My mom, naturally, got very upset that Dad was now going to see a lawyer instead of following her rules like before and cut off visitation. There were a lot of ugly fights at this point and Dad did get more visitation through court order and he had to pay less money.

Mom was very angry at my stepmom and talked bad about my stepmom a lot. In my teen years, I believed my Mom and gave hell to my stepmom, later I gradually build a decent relationship with my stepmom. We are not close, but she has always been very nice to me and patient with me so it is easy to talk to her.

When I was graduating high school, Mom didn't want my stepmom at my graduation party so my Dad didn't attend either. I was sad about that, but my Dad and stepmom did a different event for me and my stepmom even paid a part of my college tuition so I know she's not the person to stay angry at me. After my brother got into a fight with stepdad, he got kicked out of the house and went to live with Dad and stepmom. He's mad at my Mom and is close to my stepmom, so my Mom is very emotional about losing him. She is very upset so I have to keep assuring her that I will always take care of her and love her.

I am getting married next year and Mom had wanted me to wear her wedding dress. It's not something I want to do since it doesn't fit my body type. When I mentioned this to my stepmom, she wrote me a check and told me that's her wedding gift. From that money I could buy the dress I want, and get my makeup and hair done too.

When I told my Mom I will not be wearing her wedding dress she got very upset and I am trying very hard to respect her wishes and keep her happy till my wedding is done. She is very adamant that she can't stand for my stepmom to be at the wedding. I understand her position, she's always bad mouthed my stepmom to my relatives and having her there would be difficult for her. Plus with my brother not talking to her, I don't want her to think that I have abandoned her too. I know my stepmom wouldn't throw a fit if she wasn't at the wedding. These things don't matter to her, but it is very important to my Mom. The problem is that I am worried Dad won't take it well, he is very devoted to my stepmom. WIBTA if I returned stepmoms money to her and instead ask that she give me the wedding gift of not attending my wedding and talk Dad into attending it?

Update: I am sorry I can't respond to all posts but I have been reading the comments. I agree it'll be mean to ask my Stepmom to not attend. I'll not do that. I'll manage my Mom somehow, the wedding is a long way away, hopefully she'll adjust by then. A lot of you are making assumptions about my Mom that aren't true, but I can't write my whole life story here. I know she acts out and makes some foolish choices but she's not a bad person.

22035,Not the A-hole,"(Posting on behalf of a friend who doesn't have a reddit account, what follows is her words translated to English, not mine)

I (f28) have been dating my girlfriend (f27) for two years and have been living with her for the last year.

While we both hate our jobs, mine is more stable than hers and I make about 35% more than her. Because of that, when we first moved together we agreed that I would pay a larger share of rent, utilities and groceries. I also often treat her when go out to have dinner or to the cinema. It was an arrangement we both were happy with, and I was glad that I could help her out.

Yesterday she told me she was seriously considering quitting her job. I told her that it wasn't the best time for such a move, but that if she really hated her job so much of course I'd be happy to support her while she found a new job. It turned out that that's not what she meant.

She wants to quit working entirely and become a full-time homemaker. 

We had sometimes joked about that, but I had no idea she was serious. I told her that I wouldn't be comfortable with that. If we only had one salary, we'd go from living comfortably (if frugally) to having to make a major change in our lifestyle. I'd have to worry about how to pay our bills, which used to really stress me out.

She got very upset. She said she felt I wasn't taking her feelings seriously. I know that she hates her job, but I also hate mine. She's seen me crying in bed after a bad day, or losing sleep over whether I'll be fired. Quite frankly, it felt like she was saying that her own emotions were more important than mine.

Eventually, she called me cheap and said that I should tap into my savings account to help her. It's true I have some money in that saving account, but I had been hoping that it would one day become the down payment to a flat we could live in together. 

I've never been able to make her understand why it's important to me to have an egg nest. She's not very good with money herself. She's the type of person who will spend all her money on clothes or games and then will ""borrow"" money from her parents or me which she never pays back. She never saves a penny. I used to think that it wouldn't matter. I could be the responsible one, we could keep our finances separate, and that way if she ever was in an emergency I could help her out. But if she's going to insist on quitting her job I'm worried she'll use my money irresponsibly and we'll be in financial trouble. 

During our argument, I ended up admitting to that, and she got were upset. She said as her partner it was my duty to support her and that if I wasn't willing to merge our finances then I mustn't be very serious about relationship. But I am! That's why I wanted us to be able to buy a flat together eventually!

The reason I banned it you ask?

- it's not educational

- his perception of what actual families are like is skewed. These people don't film the parts where they argue, scold/discipline their kids

- they're spoilt. It's no secret that such families have made millions from their kids and as such, every other video shows them being showered with toys and money

- huge houses. Our son seems to think that our 2 bedroom flat in England is abnormal compared to these multi million pound homes in the states.

I don't agree with these channels anyway. Nobody knows yet the repurcutions these kids face from being publicised so heavy from a young age and the embarrassment they might feel watching back on themselves acting like a bunch of loons.

3931,Asshole,"I'm 47F, husband is 49M. We have three children: Jack, 26M; Jane, 23F; and Jill 19F.

When Jack went to university, he applied for grants and we paid the remainder. He graduated with no debt. Likewise when Jane went, the same situation applied. Jack went for chemistry, Jane went for kinesiology. Jill finished highschool and took a gap year and is looking to start in January.

We paid for Jack and Jane's school because university here in Ontario is relatively cheap after you account for grants. It's something like $5,000 tuition per year, but they both received anywhere from $3,500 to $4,000 per year in grants and bursaries, with the remainder being loans. Some of these grants were based on academics, but the majority is based on income and other factors. It's very cheap to go to school here because these grants are available to everyone, basically.

But we also paid for them because both my husband and I found their program choices have merit and real world applications. And we were right: Jack went on into pharmacology and makes a pretty penny, Jane got a job right out of school in sports management.

Jill wants to go double majoring in gender studies and asian culture studies. We don't want to pay for it because we think it has little merit and she'll have difficulty finding a job. Why? Some of my friends went for gender studies or sociology or anthropology when I was in school and none of them work in related fields. Some of them don't even work and are SAHMs and didn't work inbetween school and becoming SAHMs. Nothing against SAHMs but Jill claims she is career oriented and thinks this will be her career when both my husband and I don't think it'll work out.

She already got quotes for her government grants/loans and her final cost is going to be only $1,500/yr or so. She lives at home: this is something she can reasonably pay off saving a little here and there in just a couple of months. If she was determined, she could pay off her yearly loans in a single month. Even at a minimum wage job.

We want her to have the experience of having to work for school so she can rethink her major. If she has to work to go to school, she'll realize it's not as simple as she thinks and she'll become more interested in a major that can actually make her some money.

19076,Not the A-hole,"I’m using a throwaway account because I use my main solely in another sub.

I was invited to an old school friend’s wedding that happened a few days ago. We’re not ride or die, but whenever we’re both in the same region we always meet up.

I ordered a nice yellow jumpsuit for the wedding from a trusted retailer. When it came, it was much paler than the picture, basically a straw yellow. I started to worry as I’d read those stories about guests wanting to steal the thunder by wearing white/traditional wedding dress colours at weddings, and I messaged my friend to ask if she was wearing white. She said she was, and asked why. I sent a picture of the jumpsuit and said that this was what I’d been sent in place of a much brighter colour. She said that it looked fine, and she’d shut anyone up if they tried to make a deal about it on the day.

On the day itself, I didn’t actually get any comments about it directly, which was a relief. However, when I went to the bathroom, I encountered two of the bridesmaids gossiping about how that girl in the jumpsuit (so, me) had the nerve to wear it, especially after the bride had told her directly it wasn’t suitable. To frame this as it happened, I was in a cubicle when they came in and started chatting. I came out of the cubicle, and said that no such conversation had happened, and if the bride really had an issue she should have told me months ago when we talked about it. They basically scoffed and said they’d believe me when they saw the ‘receipts’. I saw them later on in the evening with the bride, and all three of them were giving me the stink eye.

Yesterday, the bride posted a thank you message on Facebook, with the comment that ‘even scene-stealing wannabes’ couldn’t spoil the day. I was going to leave it, but one of the bridesmaids commented with a poorly-taken picture of me from behind with drawn-on devil horns and tail. I reacted on impulse, and posted screenshots of the conversation where the bride had told me that my outfit was fine, with a comment saying that it was a shame that the bride couldn’t tell me to my face there was an issue, and that since I’d been asked for ‘receipts’, here they were. The comment got a few further comments saying that the tea had been spilled and that this is what happens when people don’t know all the facts, as well as the inevitable ones saying that I was being childish and creating a drama.

I do view this as stooping down to the level of those who couldn’t even tell me straight there was an issue (I mean I had another dress in my car just in case I got comments) in how I reacted, but I also think I was defending my reputation and honour among people I’ve known for over two decades. The peace-keeping side of me wants to apologise to the bride, but my heart knows she won’t offer the same olive branch, especially now people know she was two-faced in this situation.",1086,11649,0.96,AITA for posting messages exposing my friend as a liar over something that happened at her wedding?,eh7csf,2019-12-29 15:48:13,NTA,2891,AITA
2111,Not the A-hole,"My (30f) husband (39) had a vasectomy on Monday. I would say it was a pretty standard procedure, but the doctor did have to use some extra lidocaine during the procedure for pain. I've been as supportive as I know how to be. Taking on the 3 year old and 4 month old pretty much exclusively since.  And ice pack duty. 

This is including middle of the night toddler wake ups, and early morning pediatrician runs for an ear infection.  I'm waking up early to do all of the things that normally takes the two of us to do. I'm just a little worn out between work and kids, and not having my partner who is usually pretty equitable. 

The doctor said no lifting 10 pounds within 24 hours (which means both kids have to give daddy space), and light work after 48. They even said he could return to work (he took the week off) after a day off

Well tonight after staying at work late, putting both kids to bed, making a steak dinner, and staying up to watch two episodes of The Office, we squabbled.

 I went to the kitchen to unload and load dishes (usually he loads, but as stated above, I've been doing all of it), but as soon as I started I realized I made a critical error. I forgot to get more baby formula, and we wouldn't have enough for childcare tomorrow. Not good. I had already stayed up too late to spend some quality TV time with my husband, and this was just going to add to my night. 
 
I immediately looked to my husband for help. I haven't wanted to push him, but I was running on empty.  I asked him to do the dishes so I could get the formula. It was almost 10pm (LATE for me on a work night) and I'm already dead on my feet.  He gave me a big nope. He said he was still recovering and couldnt do that. He also couldn't go get the formula because he was on the Norco. I was kind of speechless. I asked again of he could do the dishes. He refused.  
I have a bit of a short temper and can get real bitchy if I'm mad, so I just kind of went silent. I had nothing nice to say so I just gave him the silent treatment. On my way out the door to the car he told me to grab him a Mountain Dew. 

When I returned he insisted that I owed him an apology. I continued ignoring him. If it's possible to see double red, I did it. 

Realistically this Reddit rant is taking longer than it took to go get the formula, but I'm just so damn mad.  I don't want to discount his pain, but he's been up and walking around since I got home, he just hasn't physically done any housework or parenting. I have a hard time believing he's in such pain that he can't take some plates out of the dishwasher, and put some bottles back in. He's about 53 hours post op.

He didn't say he was in agony, just that he was supposed to take it easy. He said he didn't want to hurt himself bending over the dishes.

So Reddit, am I the asshole? Do I owe him an apology?

19767,Asshole,"
A few (4) weeks ago I was drinking with my husband (H), his best friend (HBF), and his very pregnant wife (PW) on their back porch one evening. 

I am a loud drunk and I also joke around a lot, to the point where a majority of what I’m saying is not serious. If I need to talk about a serious subject I will change my tone but I’d say about 95% of the time, I’m joking around just being dumb. 

H, HBF and I were all decently intoxicated, PW obviously was the only sober one. Our friend group has know each other about 4 years, and we are all very close. (HBF and PW were best man and maiden of honor in H and I’s wedding) 
I was being loud, as usual, when PW said something about me hurting the baby’s ears because I was being loud as well as H saying I was hurting his ears. I don’t remember what was said exactly.
I proceeded to say, “fuck off, baby” to PW’s belly. 
In no way did I mean any malice by this, and I said it in a joking fashion. 
The next day I get a text from PW saying how upset she was that I told an innocent unborn baby to fuck off and that she is not okay with things like that being said. 
I understand and agree that I shouldn’t have taken it that far. I apologized to her in hopes that we can move on and I’m obviously never going to say something like that again.",54,45,0.9,AITA for saying something I shouldn’t have while I was intoxicated?,h9md73,2020-06-15 18:53:42,YTA,1291,AITA
14205,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I have a 5 year old boy (R) who is named after my father, who died when I was 14. His middle name (C) is after my MIL's father, and he has my husband's (therefore FIL's) surname. 

My FIL is known exclusively by his middle name, as was his uncle who raised him, but my husband has always been called by his first name.  When my son was a baby my FIL started calling him by his middle name. I asked him to stop, and told him how important the name was to me. FIL then said that he would always be known as C to him. I told him, mostly jokingly, that if he kept calling R that, then I would change his surname to my maiden name. Everyone laughed. 

Since then however, both MIL and FIL refer to him as C, but not around me, only around my husband. R doesn't like it, and has told them C is not his name.  My husband has asked them to stop, but there is a pretty strained relationship there so he's reluctant to rock the boat. In Christmas and Birthday cards they only ever write ""To our grandson.""

Today the in-laws had come round for a visit, and just as they were getting up to leave FIL called my son C in front of me. I said ""who?"" very loudly, but FIL just walked off to the car. MIL had missed it, but could see I was upset and asked what was wrong. I told her and said that I thought it was incredibly disrespectful. I did swear a few times, but then apologised and explained it was just because I was so angry. She was not impressed, she told me that I was being ridiculous and that it wasn't important. I that it was to me, and that if it wasn't important to them, then they should call him by his given name.  FIL had then come back to see what was happening, and MIL was laughing when she told him that he'd upset me. He also laughed and said ""story of my life"" before going back to the car. 

My husband understands how angry I am, but doesn't think the fight is worth it. He's right in that we can't change them, but my current attitude is that if they can't call him R then they don't see him. There is very little positive interaction between them generally anyway, when we're around them they tend to ignore us and just argue with each other. I'm also not going to go into the racist, bigoted, Brexit-voting views they have discussed in front of my son in the past.

Yesterday, she went to the store (without my knowledge; I was in Zoom calls all day) and came back with groceries and a small bouquet of sunflowers. That evening, I told her I would buy us dinner but asked her to order it through her phone (she‘s way pickier about food than I am and often spends 15-20 minutes in the Uber Eats app before we place the order).

I reject the request and proceed to pay her for 50% of the groceries, the cost of dinner but not whatever she wanted me to pay for the flowers. 2 minutes later, she storms into the living room, visibly angry. She tells me she feels disrespected by my refusal to buy her flowers to which I respond that, to me, a gift is a proactive act, and I had no idea she even went to the store in the first place, let alone bought flowers.

I told my BF to just chuck the clothes in (mostly my underwear and 1 dress) when the washer was done. So I leave and come back to ask my BF where my clothes are. He said that he only did one load before he needed to leave so he just left the clothes there for next time. Ok cool. We went there 2 days later and ask his mom where my stuff is. She doesn't know. I look everywhere and think hmmm that is weird I really need to wash my underwear. 2 more days pass and I ask her again where are my clothes? She said that she ""thinks"" she threw them away while cleaning her house. She said she didn't know who they belonged to so she just threw them away and she is very sorry.

WELL I was really upset about this. First of all this felt really personal. None of my BF's clothes were missing plus she lives with her two teenage daughters who have very similar Victoria Secret underwear to mine and none of there stuff was missing either. Of course they are just clothes, I can always get new stuff but for me it is about the principle. I told my BF that I need her to pay me back for what she threw away.

He said ""YoU HaVe PleNTy Of mOnEY JuST BuY NeW OnEs"" and also ""IT WaS aN AcCiDenT"" Again It is about the principle.

11527,Not the A-hole,"I will start by saying I pay for about 70-80% of me and my wife’s cost of living expenses (necessities). She makes about 1/3 what I do so I like for her to be able to save and have extra money for things she wants, vice dump it all into cost of living.

My wife has a friend called Yasmin. Yasmin is part of some group (it has a spanish name so I don’t know what it is) that says they empower women. My wife told me about this group one day, apparently you submit $1000 (somewhere or to someone??) and become a level 1 group member, gaining levels by recruiting more members. Once you reach level 5 or so of the community, you have about 30 people under you, and you graduate from the community and receive $30,000. All the while the group is supposed to support each other and help you attain your goals by giving you that cash infusion at the end. The whole process is supposed to take 2 months.

As soon as she told me about this, the words MLM, scam, and other things came to mind. In my opinion, this is some type of MLM disguised in a veil of “empowerment of women.” Yasmin is 4 months in and still trying to recruit people because she has not seen her money yet. Somehow Yasmin has convinced my wife to join this cause. I tried explaining to her that some MLMs *do* actually work, but those stories are few and far between and only to the insider people who started the whole thing in the first place, never the grunts that join later. I told her that if she does this she will 1) never see her money again 2) become an embarrassment to herself as she begins to essentially ask all her friends and family for money to join the program so that she can get hers 3) waste a lot of time when this never works out. I think she has good intentions, at least as far as wanting to make more money and contribute, but she has somehow gotten tricked into thinking this get rich quick maneuver will work.

When she told me she wanted to join I fought her on it and told her that I will stop helping her pay for things on this main basis: I am currently doing so because I like to help her with her basic needs/necessities so she can spend her money on things she wants.  Because this $1000->$30,000 is not a 100% guarantee, she is essentially gambling her money that she will turn a profit. In this perspective, she has money beyond her basic wants and she even has enough to gamble with, therefore there is no reason for me to still be supporting her needs/necessities.

19058,Not the A-hole,"My buddy (let’s call him Ben) and his girlfriend of 2 years just broke up. They got into an argument after she informed him that she stopped taking birth control. Ben said that she “blindsided” him with this information, and that he “can’t stay hard with condoms on”, so it will ruin their sex life. But what got him most mad was that she decided to stop taking birth control without talking it over with him, and she can’t be making huge decisions like that on her own without consulting him. She did not like how mad he got about it and it turned into an extremely ugly argument that ended with her breaking up with him.  

Ben was devastated and wanted a few guys and me to meet him at his bar. He told the story and all of my buddies were on his side. I was kinda shocked. I told him that it sucks he got dumped and i felt bad but at the same time he was in the wrong here. I went on about how taking birth control is totally up to her, and he can be “bummed” by the decision because sex without condoms is way better, but if she doesn’t want to take birth control, it’s her choice. I have a wife and lots of female friends, and I’ve heard countless rants on why birth control sucks and taking it can be a nuisance. It’s not like she told him about it mid sex, she told him right away. Then i said, half jokingly although it’s kind of accurate, “i love you man, but that was toxic af” and yes i said it like that to be comically dick. He did not like my response and said I was being an asshole. My one friend took me to the side and said that “this is no time to act woke, and that a bro always takes the bro’s side in a breakup”. It’s not like I plan on being friends with her and ditching my friend. I’m still gonna be friends with him, I just now know he has some warped opinions on birth control etiquette, and can’t hold a boner in condoms. 

But maybe I did pick the wrong time to point out that he was wrong, maybe I should’ve just empathized with him for losing his gf. I kind of feel like I broke the bro code for a trivial reason and I could’ve just said “that sucks” and moved on.

EDIT: I feel I should clarify this because it seems to be something brought up a lot in the comments. She told him the day she stopped, it wasn’t like she hadn’t been taking BC and just told him now, she stopped the day she told him. Guess I should’ve said “she’s stopping taking BC”.

21974,Everyone Sucks,"This happened pre-covid, but it's caused a big divide in my family. 

I'm a tattoo artist. Not famous or anything, but I own my own shop and am pretty well known within my city's tattoo scene. I also have a very particular art style and very rarely divert from this style (why fix what isn't broken?). This style does not include portraits, and I have not done a portrait tattoo in years upon years. 

So, my cousin had been throwing not-so-subtle hints every single time I'd seen him since he became a father 3 years ago. My cousin and I aren't particularly close. After 3 years he just straight up asked if I could give him a tattoo of his daughter. I, not being a portrait artist and taking my art very seriously, said no. I did give him recommendations for the best artists in the city who do portraits (and could probably give him a discount if they knew he was my cousin). 

He did not give up. In retrospect, I know I should've stood my ground, but he would switch between being super flattering and telling me how good my art is to passive aggressively complaining about my refusal until I gave in. He did agree to pay (albeit, much less than I would charge my regular customers). 

Anyways, I gave him the portrait and it turned out just how I expected. I mean, it's not the *worst* tattoo anyone's ever seen, but it's not great. I did try my best, but again... not my style. 

My cousin lost his shit, telling me I'm the worst artist he's ever met, refusing to pay, and telling me that I made his daughter look ugly. 

After being practically bullied into wasting my time tattooing someone with no respect for me or my art for a heavy discount, then being treated like shit for giving them what they wanted, I was pretty done. I said ""Well, maybe your daughter is fucking ugly"", and then slammed the door and locked him out of the shop.

Most of my family now thinks I'm an asshole for bringing an innocent child into this, etc. I don't think it matters because that's not really the point (and it's not like I said it to her face). My coworkers and friends are on my side. AITA?


EDIT: 
Just wanted to clarify some things. Some have asked me why I didn't sketch it out before tattooing him--I did. Sketches on paper look somewhat different than on skin, and I told him this, but he insisted that it was fine. Also tracing portraits on the skin beforehand doesn't [give that great an idea of how the finished tattoo will look,](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcR5sv-K2fcDDoswgREj_G_Q7_G6RQTE6-g5qA&usqp=CAU) as another redditor has pointed out (that picture is an example from the internet, not my tat).

1383,No A-holes here,"My sibling and I share a mother and have different fathers. Our mother is dead, and sibling's father suffers from depression and has a lower I.Q, making it difficult for him to cope with situations. He loves and cares for S (sibling,) but it doesn't seem to be even close to enough.

&#x200B;

I have pressure from spouse's family to take S every weekend. I can't/ won't do this anymore. I work, school, and have my own toddler and spouse. Week days and ends are very busy. I am dealing with my own mental illnesses and require times of solitude to recharge for the next day/ week.

&#x200B;

S is a good kid, they aren't rude or violent. They are in grade school, but poop their pants regularly and lie about it. If you ask S if they've pooped, they will tell you no. You have to force them to change underwear and shower. Toddler and S play together very nicely, very rarely any fighting at all. But they both get rowdy and need to be told to quiet down multiple times, which really isn't an issue most times.

&#x200B;

S has issues eating and requires redirection back to every meal. S gets distracted and leaves the meal, and needs to be told to please continue eating at least 10 times during a meal. S's doctor has informed the father that S needs to eat more, as they are very underweight. S is very picky, refusing to eat anything that isn't pizza, tacos, wonder bread (very few fruits and veg,) so when S is here, I make whatever I know they will eat and gently push a fruit or veg with each meal.

&#x200B;

I have not been taking S regularly, averaging about once per month. My spouse's family will go and pick S up and S will stay at their house. S and spouse's family are close. Spouse's family puts a LOT of pressure on me to go and pick S up every weekend. 80% of the conversations I have with spouse's family are about  how I need to take S for more sleepovers. While spouse's family has a good heart, they are not taking into consideration all of the factors when pressuring me to take S. I am not S's parent. When our mother was alive, I took S as much as I could because I knew our mother was a poor parent.

&#x200B;

This is the part that I struggle with, as I know it is very selfish. I do not want to be S's parent or caregiver anymore. I cannot do it without neglecting my own child. S requires a lot more attention and redirection than my toddler. I have my own family to take care of, and S's father needs to learn how to take care of S. Spouse's family does not feel this way, as ""S is my sibling, and I have an obligation to care for their well being, and it's selfish of me to not take S because of the slight issues occur."" I have taken S for several straight days, and by the end, I am exhausted and want to get drunk.

&#x200B;

Once the issues listed are addressed, I don't want to take S for sleepovers. Day trips are perfectly fine. AITA?

Edit: I wasnt clear enough, I understand that now. DCF has been involved for several months, and S sees both a school psychologist and has therapy 1 x month. DCF worker and I have communicated, but she has made it clear that she cant discuss the case in its entirety.

5883,Not the A-hole,"OK. So, not a great title but idk how to word this. 
I am currently planning a big party for my mom's 50th birthday. I have poured my heart into this event. My mom has not had a birthday party since she was 15. Shes been going through a rough time lately, and I reeeeeeaaaaaaaally want this party to be perfect. 
So, problem is, I have a cousin (*Joe*) who has been openly gay for like 10 years, and has recently started dating a very lovely gentleman (*Greg*). My grandmother has never fully accepted that Joe is gay, and has been very dramatic about the boyfriend. Recently, at a family get together, Joe ran his hands through Greg's hair and kissed him, in full view of the family. It was not performative, it was not drawn out, just a quick kiss, almost nobody even noticed(they where off to the side, not actively participating  in the convo or anything). Well, Grandma noticed and is extremely upset. She has told everyone that she will only come to the party if Greg is not there. The whole family agrees, and is saying that it was disrespectful for them to kiss in front of everyone, and that he shouldn't bring Greg, out of respect for our grandmother. 100% if Joe was in a straight relationship and they kissed in the same manner, it would be a non issue, as the whole fam is very affectionate and all about pda. This is ONLY because Greg is a man, and it is a gay relationship. 
She has yet to broach the subject to me directly, but when she does Im going to tell her to not come. I refuse to rescind Greg's invitation, just because my grandmother (and a handful of other relatives honestly) are bigots. 
ALSO, I found out last week that my 13yo sister is bi and has a secret girlfriend, and I never ever ever want her to feel like she has to hide that from family, and I want her to know that I will ALWAYS defend her, and that part of her, especially with our family.
I genuinely love my grandmother. I want her to be there. I want that for her, and moreso I know that it will break my mom's heart if she doesn't come, but I just can't bring myself to compromise my morals on this.
I refuse to treat my cousins sexual orientation (or my sisters) as something shameful or secret, that should be hidden to protect someone's delicate sensibilities. 
So, WIBTA for not uninviting my cousin's boyfriend?
ETA: I'm not un-inviting my grandmother, I intend on telling her that Im not going to rescind Greg's invitation, even if that means she won't be there.

15296,Not the A-hole,"Apologies if weed is a controversial topic. Throwaway account. 

Before me and my fiancé met, I was an intense stoner. Like smoke weed every day kind of stoner. 100% positive that I was psychologically dependent on it. When I met my fiancé, he told me he didn’t smoke weed, haven’t since high school, didn’t like it and didn’t want it in his life. Eventually it came to the question, well do you want to stay with me even though I smoke weed? And his answer was I don’t know. I decided to try to quit and it worked out for quite a while. Soon it became this “promise” between us. Like I quit weed for our relationship.

When I found out my mom smoked weed it sucked because it would have been cool to have smoked weed with her before I quit if I had known. She wished we had too and asked me to share a joint with her for “one and one time only” and I caved and shared one with her. Because it was my mom and I wanted the experience. Strike one. My fiancé was pissed and felt betrayed.

After some time passed (maybe a year) it was around Christmas when a lot of people in my circle were around and visiting. There was weed around and my fiancé made the decision that he wouldn’t be mad at me if I wanted to smoke every now and then, pretty much giving his consent ever since the situation with my mom and some conversations we had over the time span. I said alright and left it at that. I did end up smoking after that, but it still caused some turmoil regardless of him saying it would be okay, so after one argument I said he should never have said that and that I would just try to stop again. He said whatever. 

Fast forward to this year. My sister started smoking so whenever I come home, it’s here and everywhere. Intense triggers. In the beginning I was good. Could be around it and not do anything. But as time passed, the peer pressure got stronger and cravings too.

Now last night, I messed up. My mom was taking a bong hit and she couldn’t clear it so she handed to me in a ‘panic’ and without thinking I cleared it. I didn’t get ‘stoned’ but I felt instantly guilty. This morning, we were talking on the phone and my fiancé asked if I got high (a recurring habit when I’m visiting family without him) and I told him what happened. He hung up on me, and texted me to tell me he doesn’t trust me anymore. I finally admitted that I think I still kind of have the psychological craving/addiction and that I fucked up. And he said whatever, I don’t care what you say or believe what you say anymore.

I asked if it was okay to come home or if he wants space. His response was “Do what you want. It’s not like you care about what I want anyways” and hasn’t responded to my last text. 

AITA for smoking weed or is this an over the top reaction? 

TLDR; fiancé hates weed, so I quit, trip up and smoke, he gives me the go ahead, then gets mad when I do it, I say I’ll try to stop again, time goes by and then I smoked weed and now he no longer trusts me and doesn’t want to talk.

10907,Not the A-hole,"Sounds insane I know. Please hear me out. 

So about 7 months ago I adopted the most ADORABLE kitten from my university’s local pet shelter rescue program. They were at capacity and had to get these kittens adopted ASAP, and since I have an apartment I share with dad, I thought, why not? 

My dad and I LOVE this kitten. He’s quite at home in the apartment and since he was feral, he only trusts us and a handful of other people. 

My parents are divorced, live in different states. Used to live w mom when I was young, currently crashing at dad’s because he’s close to my uni. my younger brother still lives with our mother. My dad and I “share” the cat, but it’s clear he’s mine because I feed him and clean up after him, etc.

Well, when my mother heard about the cat, she flipped. My brother occasionally comes to visit, but is highly allergic to cats, same as her. The thing is, before I adopted the cat, my brother made it explicitly clear that he never wanted to visit my father again. (We have a really rough and abusive past with him but that’s irrelevant here. I’m trying to patch things up because he’s helping pay for my college, my bro wants to cut him off completely.) she keeps telling me to get rid of my cat!

So when our mother freaked out, I explained what brother had said. She said that was no excuse and that he “had to see his father”. I told her he should be able to do what he wants, and that made her angrier. Several months later (now) he actually wants to come visit bc “daddy has money” so my mom is once again pressuring me to get rid of MY cat, so my brother can stay with us for a weekend. 

I’m telling her to just give him lots of Zyrtec or other allergy meds. We are planning on getting out of the house, a little camping trip or something, while my brother is in town so he’s exposed to the cat minimally. Since he doesn’t live here, I feel like that’s fair. He’s my cat, who’s very attached to me. If my brother were moving in, it would be a different situation. 

My mom is very angry, claiming I’m “choosing a cat over my brother”.

So, AITA for not wanting to get rid of my cat?

EDIT- so I saw a lot of stuff calling me TA for “using my father for money.” I actually don’t ask that much of him and he’s not fully paying for my school. I’m trying to be the “better person”, my mom’s words, not mine, and be nice to him even though he was horrible to me in the past. (He actually wants to spend time with me now. He happens to live close to my school. It is convenient) My brother is clearly using our dad for money but I can’t stop him. My mom constantly encourages us to patch things up with him, she never badmouths him. His behavior speaks for itself, unfortunately. Since we aren’t any serious physical danger, she can force my brother to visit since he’s young. Also, my brother’s “severe” allergies are like, a lot of sneezing, watery/itchy eyes, and at the absolute worst a minor cough. He’s never had trouble breathing or anything. He has a hypoallergenic cat at our mom’s place and it’s helping him build some tolerance to cats. I know allergies suck, but we can go elsewhere for the weekend, probably. Hopefully that clears things up.

Me (23,m) and Misha (24,f) are friends and we live together to save money. We decided to throw a mini reunion party for our friends (after pandemic ofc) and we discussed about about everything including food. Misha is coming from a more privileged family, and she suggested that we call a chef to cook for us. I was surprised a bit, and I said it's better to cook simple stuff or order food instead of calling a chef because it might be a teeny bit awkward to invite a chef for a reunion party and it's a bit inauthentic for small events like this. She got peeved and said that its no different than ordering food or eat at a restaurant and all of the food was prepared by a chef. I argued that I'm talking from middle class ground and our apartment is not fancy enough to invite a chef but if she wants to, we can make an arrangement with the chef.

My girlfriend and I just bought our first house in a quiet neighborhood where the houses are very close together and most of the people living there don't seem to mind it at all. We made a point so say hello to all of our new neighbors and build a friendly rapport - this is our first house and we really want to be good neighbors.

Our neighbors on both sides turned out to be really nice! We get along well and talk often. They both offer to help us move and give us advice and tips for places to eat around here - all that stuff. Offer to have us over for BBQs. They're nice people. 

Anyways, the fences on both sides of our backyard are very short, about 4 feet tall.

He spends the majority of his free time in his bedroom, smoking pot and playing games on his PC. About twenty hours a week is spent outside of this setting, either working at the fast food restaurant he's employed at or shopping for junk food at the grocery. He doesn't help clean, do laundry, cook, or complete any other chores around the household. And while I know this shouldn't have any bearing on the situation, he started identifying as a woman about eight months ago. Aside from growing out his hair and occasionally wearing dresses, I've yet to see him attempt to do anything else that would be considered feminine (ie. wear makeup, shower more frequently, etc.) The reason I bring this up is because it makes my mom uncomfortable to be around, but she's a very timid person that tries her best to avoid conflict. All this in mind, I gave up years ago on trying to convince my brother to strive for something more, or to seek financial independence from our mom. It doesn't help that she enables him too, but that's a different story.

I started yelling back, eventually telling him that he was a freeloading mooch that uses his transgender persona as a ploy to gain sympathy from strangers. At this point we were both in each other's faces, and my mom threatened to call the police unless I left, which I did.

I started dating a guy from a Balkan country and was making plans to go visit him and his family, and while doing so I found this AMAZING package deal that lets you travel the Balkans, Spain, Greece, Turkey and Morocco. Seriously, it was like a once in a lifetime deal and though it's pretty expensive, it's WAY cheaper than it would be to find places to stay and travel to those places on your own.

I KNEW Mandy couldn't afford it, and I KNEW it would hurt her deeply that she wasn't getting a chance to go. This trip is literally what she dreams of doing, and with me in particular, but she's been in a lot of financial trouble lately. So I told her I was planning a trip, but not any of the details. I also told another very close friend about the trip, and she looked up the same deal and decided she wanted to go as well. I said I'd love to have the company, so she bought her tickets and she's coming along too. I realized that if Mandy heard about this or found out about this before I got a chance to tell her she'd be super hurt, so I told her about the trip. 

She was SOOOOOOO upset. She asked about why I didn't invite her, and I told her it was because I knew she couldn't afford it and I thought it would just be salt in the wound. (I also privately think she would have made some very questionable decisions in order to fund the trip, or would have gone and then not had enough for money, or her bills, or things like that at home.)

However the issue is that a couple of weeks ago we were talking about moving in together and she says ""well you'll obviously not be making meat in the house anyway"" which just took me by surprise and after talking about it a bit more (which turned into an argument) it turns out that when/if we moved in together that she expects me to not cook or eat meat in the house at all, even if we had separate pans, cooking utensils etc. Her reasoning is that ""I just find it disgusting, I'll never have it in my house, you can eat it at work but not in the house"" I understand relationships are about compromise and sacrifice but surely the compromise here is to have separate cooking utensils. 

I went from wanting to move in with her and progress our relationship to hitting this wall and thinking that one of us will just end up resenting the other if we are so opposed on this and one has to concede.

8631,No A-holes here,"I'm going to word this one in a very frank way without trying to make myself sound better or anything:

My girlfriend and I just bought our first house in a quiet neighborhood where the houses are very close together and most of the people living there don't seem to mind it at all. We made a point so say hello to all of our new neighbors and build a friendly rapport - this is our first house and we really want to be good neighbors.

Our neighbors on both sides turned out to be really nice! We get along well and talk often. They both offer to help us move and give us advice and tips for places to eat around here - all that stuff. Offer to have us over for BBQs. They're nice people. 

Anyways, the fences on both sides of our backyard are very short, about 4 feet tall. During one of our conversations, one of the neighbors mentioned that she was offended, maybe even a little mad, that the person the other side of her backyard put up a taller privacy fence. Here's the thing: I like our neighbors, but they are always in their backyards. I just want to be able to hang out in peace without having to act a certain way and say hello and talk to my neighbors for 15 minutes every time I go out there. I want our backyard to be a private space for us to hang out and do our thing. Maybe I wanna act a little weird without being self conscious. 

That said, I want to plant lots of bushes and trees along the outside of the backyard to get some privacy. I believe I'm the first person to do this. If you were a cynic, you might be inclined to call it ""blocking them out"". I'd still invite them to BBQs and talk to them when I see them, but I do want to be able to hang out in my backyard without them.

My ex cheated on me with him. I lost my house and paid a lump sum in alimony. I still live with my parents whilst trying to get my life back together. I told them at dinner that I would not.

11527,Not the A-hole,"I will start by saying I pay for about 70-80% of me and my wife’s cost of living expenses (necessities). She makes about 1/3 what I do so I like for her to be able to save and have extra money for things she wants, vice dump it all into cost of living.

My wife has a friend called Yasmin. Yasmin is part of some group (it has a spanish name so I don’t know what it is) that says they empower women. My wife told me about this group one day, apparently you submit $1000 (somewhere or to someone??) and become a level 1 group member, gaining levels by recruiting more members. Once you reach level 5 or so of the community, you have about 30 people under you, and you graduate from the community and receive $30,000. All the while the group is supposed to support each other and help you attain your goals by giving you that cash infusion at the end. The whole process is supposed to take 2 months.

As soon as she told me about this, the words MLM, scam, and other things came to mind. In my opinion, this is some type of MLM disguised in a veil of “empowerment of women.” Yasmin is 4 months in and still trying to recruit people because she has not seen her money yet. Somehow Yasmin has convinced my wife to join this cause. I tried explaining to her that some MLMs *do* actually work, but those stories are few and far between and only to the insider people who started the whole thing in the first place, never the grunts that join later. I told her that if she does this she will 1) never see her money again 2) become an embarrassment to herself as she begins to essentially ask all her friends and family for money to join the program so that she can get hers 3) waste a lot of time when this never works out. I think she has good intentions, at least as far as wanting to make more money and contribute, but she has somehow gotten tricked into thinking this get rich quick maneuver will work.

When she told me she wanted to join I fought her on it and told her that I will stop helping her pay for things on this main basis: I am currently doing so because I like to help her with her basic needs/necessities so she can spend her money on things she wants.  Because this $1000->$30,000 is not a 100% guarantee, she is essentially gambling her money that she will turn a profit. In this perspective, she has money beyond her basic wants and she even has enough to gamble with, therefore there is no reason for me to still be supporting her needs/necessities. 

I will admit that I feel like I am using money to strong arm her into making a decision for her. I would normally never do this to her but I just feel so strongly that she is about to get screwed over and I don’t want to see that happen to her, so I am almost threatening her to save her from herself. I did end the conversation with, I cannot make the decision for you, I can just tell you my thoughts on the matter and inform you of the actions I am going to take if you still decide to do through with this.",227,974,0.97,AITA for threatening to stop supporting my wife financially?,bvjb68,2019-06-01 10:13:25,NTA,2979,AITA

My dad on the other hand always blew off my brother and made out that my brother could control his mental state etc and he would call my bro ‘Ralph wiggum’ as a really mean way of calling him dumb.

Anyway all my bro eats is tomato soup and grilled cheese when his routine is disrupted, I guess it’s comfort for him. I hate cooking and usually my mom makes it for my bro if we have to travel out of state or whatever but obviously he’s my brother and I’m gonna look after him. 

My dad refuses to help with my brothers needs because he doesn’t believe in autism.

5412,Not the A-hole," This happened a few years ago, but I was recently reminded of it and it got me thinking again.  I was working in retail. There was a new girl hired in our department who went through the training and  joined the sales floor, and then started calling in sick and missing shifts regularly. 
 Our manager kept us informed of her reasons, which all seemed to be valid. She was pregnant, but having complications,  then in the hospital, then home recovering, then sick with something else. I went out one Friday night for a friend's birthday and ran into her at a bar. We chatted a bit ""Oh, how are you doing? We miss you at the store...etc."" She tells me she's feeling better and will be back tomorrow. 
 Next day Saturday rolls around and we are doing our weekly all store meeting. Manager says ""Oh, sorry guys you're down 1 again today, she called in sick again."" I turn to my ""friend"" next  to me and say innocently ""Oh that's too bad. I saw her last night and she said she was feeling better and would be in. Guess she's still not feeling good enough to work. I hope she isn't back in the hospital."" Later I'm called into the managers office and grilled. Where did I see her? What bar? What exactly did she say? 
 Later that day, I'm in another department and this one guy starts giving me shit for being a narc and getting the girl in trouble with management. ""Oh, remind me never to go out drinking with you!

5245,Asshole,"Hi Reddit!   So, I feel like a dick right now but I need your opinion.   One of my good friends from college, lets call her L, is getting married this weekend and has been planning this wedding for about a year now.   Originally, I was not given a plus one although I had a boyfriend since before she even got engaged.   Whatever, I can deal.

Earlier this month at another friends wedding (whom did give me a plus one and boyfriend knew about months in advance), L finally meets my boyfriend and gets drunk and invites him to the wedding.   He obliged at that time so the next day I send L his info.  Fast forward to 11 days before her wedding, I tell L that I didn't think my boyfriend would make it because it is the last day he could move.  Specifically, he and I have just moved in together and he's taken the entire month to make the move.  In his words, he's got a lot going on and really needs the Saturday to himself.   I can confirm that, he has a very demanding job.

This is where I need your help.   As soon as I told her this, L flips out at me and tells me that he has to come since that Friday (I had told her Monday morning) she already finalized the guest count and sent in the deposit.   Then, 3 days ago, my other friend E who is also a bridesmaid flips out on me about my boyfriend not coming since it was ""a very expensive wedding"".  E says I need to offer L money for his seat since she had to do and pay extra to invite him last minute.

AITA for canceling his reservation 11 days in advance?  Should I offer to pay for his seat?

Please note:  I am not a bridesmaid or in the wedding at all.

UPDATE:  Thank you all for your detailed and honest responses!   I have carefully looked through all of them and yes, I agree IATA.   Now, I did fail to mention that my boyfriend has significant mental health issues and debilitating anxiety.  For context, we're both recovering addicts and mental health and sobriety has to come first for either of us to be fully functioning members of society (some may think this is a cop out, but they have also not walked in our shoes).   He would never have cancelled had this week not been weighing in on this.   Finally, how to make this right.  I spoke to E (who spoke to L) and I came up with a plan to 1. double her gift amount to pay for his portion, and 2. find someone to bring to the wedding who L likes.

15797,Asshole,"I was at a coffee shop after work the other day. When I entered I noticed a guy, white, probably late 20s, scrawny, looked like the kind of person who works in IT and saves his money to fly to Thailand twice a year for ""sightseeing"" with a young Asian girl, she looked like 12 to 14 or so to me, slim, small body, looked like my niece who is 12, and a young looking face as well.

Didn't really think too much of it and I sat down a bit away from them, facing the same direction as the girl so I couldn't really see her perfectly. But I did notice that the guy seemed to do her like gently stroking her cheek and even leaning over to give her a kiss (not on the cheek). It made me sick and since I had recently read about underaged sex traffic victims from Asian countries I wondered whether this might be one of those scenarios.

So outside I decided to call the police and told them that I had seen an adult man making out with a young girl here. I waited across the street until they arrived. They got inside and since there were only few people inside they found them quickly. I could see them through the glass window. They talked to them shortly, then the girl talked, then she showed them what I presume was her ID, the policemen seemed somewhat apologetic and left. Afterwards it looked to me like the guy was consoling her.

I concluded that she probably must have been older and I misjudged her age. I debated whether I should go inside to apologize but I didn't really want to face them so I left.

8685,Everyone Sucks,"This is a throwaway account.

Backstory- I’ve had my cat for five years, meaning I had her well before moving into this house and made sure everyone was ok with it before signing the lease. My roommate decided she wanted to foster a dog a few weeks ago. Seeing as fostering is usually temporary, I agreed because my cat gets along with my mom's dog therefore I didn't think it would be an issue. Turns out she is terrified of the dog and hides in my room 24/7. Long story short my roommate ended up adopting the dog and told us after it had already been done.

I got home yesterday, my roommate was gone but the dog was in the living room. I put him in her room so that my cat could go outside of my room if she wanted to. Her dog unfortunately ripped her carpet and two pairs of her shoes to shreds. Roommate wants me to pay for a portion of the cost of the carpet because this wouldn’t have happened if I had put him in the crate. In hindsight I agree it was a careless mistake to not put him in the crate, but it didn’t cross my mind because I've never even seen her put him in the crate. When she's home she has the dog in her room with her, and when she's gone she just lets him roam around the house. I didn't realize the dog would have a problem being confided in her room.  Under different circumstances I would be more willing to contribute some money, but I’m just pissed about this dog being here so I don’t want to. AITA

18854,Not the A-hole,"Heya. 

So this happened a few days ago, and I'm still pretty worried about whether I'm an asshole or not. 

I take the bus to and from work and it's quite a long commute. Background: 

 I have epilepsy. I have a seizure alert dog, and he comes with me on the bus. Because hes trained to do all kinds of support tasks, hes a large breed dog (sheepdog/poodle cross). 

Ive had a lot of seizures on the bus, so I have a hard time mentally dealing with the commute every day. To accommodate his size and to make me comfortable, I sit in the disability seating section if it's available so he can lay beneath/between my legs and out of the way. 

Now onto the story: 

I'm on the bus ride home, and I found a seat in the disability section. I was about 2 stops from my home, and  I was starting to have a few auras, so my dog turned around and was facing me/alerting me. The next thing I know, I see a flash. 

I look up, and a man sitting near me was holding up his phone and taking a picture of me. I was in a bit of a rough state, so I asked him to delete it. I was probably firmer than I usually would be, but my dog was alerting me and I had about 10-15 mins to get home. 

The man was stuttering and saying things like ""I just wanted a picture he was being so cute and I saw his ID badge (he has one attached to his vest that says ""seizure alert dog"")."" I asked him again to delete the pic and then he goes ""my daughter has epilepsy and it would be important to her to see a working seizure alert dog"" 

I told him there were plenty of resources online and made him show me that he deleted it. 

I was then at my stop and ran home.

I felt bad, because I do epilepsy activism work so I felt for him but I was really uncomfortable with someone taking a picture of me while my seizure alert dog in the disability section just felt wrong. 

Should I have just let him keep the picture? AITA?

Edit to clear up some things: 

-I dont care about legality, just the asshole nature of the situation
-I'm a female :) 
-I live in Canada
-While I dont have exclusive photosensitive epilepsy, flashing lights make my auras worse 
-If he had asked me, I would have gotten out of the way and let him take a picture of my dog. Hes super cute so I get it.

14280,Not the A-hole,"Every year, the HR department for my company (mid-size software company) puts on an Easter egg hunt for the employees.  Most eggs are filled with candy, but as some of the eggs can contain cash (one egg with $50, a few with $5 or $1) or vouchers for time off, people tend to take it very seriously.

Here’s how the hunt works - there’s a strip of grass that runs between the employee parking lot and a major road.  There’s some generic office-park style landscaping on this strip - hedges, small trees, bushes.  HR hides several hundred small plastic eggs, most in plain sight and easily grabbed.  The employees wait at a designated spot, and when given the green light everyone runs for the eggs.

Unfortunately, I was busy this afternoon so couldn’t participate.  However, since my office window looks over the egg hunt site, I thought it would be cute to video the hunt for HR to use in future promos (since they put a lot of work into it).  I prepped my phone, got a good angle, and waited until I saw people moving to start filming.

I hit the video button when I saw movement, but what I realized I was seeing was a woman who had been hanging out between two employee cars with a plastic bag go shooting out into the hunt site and start wildly stuffing eggs into her bag (another girl appears in the frame as well, not sure if she was hiding between cars too).  The video shows a solid 30 seconds of them taking maybe 70% of the eggs.  Then, a wave of other employees (coming from the official start location) comes into frame. The rest of the eggs are gone in seconds, with most employees visibly disappointed not to find a single egg.

So, WIBTA if I sent the video to HR as originally planned?  I don’t want to call out the cheating, but they’ll likely see it in the video if they watch it.  I’d just say, as originally planned, “Hey, I took a video of the egg hunt and thought you guys might want to use for promo material or something.”

One compounding factor - I don’t know the woman personally, but I do know she works in a department notorious for low pay ($15 an hour) and boring work - basically just outbound calling from a list all day.   So, I have sympathy.  But, I also know it meant other people on her team probably didn’t get any eggs.

Most people who go there are great, but today when I went there was a woman there who brought her horde of children with her.

My freshman year of college (I’m now in grad school), I met a senior from a neighboring school (let’s call him Will) on a dating app that I thought was very attractive. We went on a couple dates, but I actually ended up dating a guy in my grade from my university for about 2 years. 

Will was respectful of that, but still kept in touch. He was originally from a suburb of Detroit, but now lives in Nashville. Coincidentally, I interned in Detroit last summer. He randomly came home, and went to a baseball game because my home state team was playing. I thought this was a coincidence, but he later told me he bought last minute tickets to the game after seeing the stadium on my Instagram. 

I am now going to grad school in Nashville, which is where Will lives now. I stayed with him when I came for my interview, and we’ve still stayed in touch. He keeps asking me to send naked pictures, and saying I used to be more playful when I was younger. It bothers me because I just have matured and no longer want to send those photos. I’ve explained this to him, but he says he “wishes we could go back to before”

My brother is going to a military academy tomorrow, and we had a party this afternoon to say goodbye to him. Will keeps texting me despite my letting him know I was busy spending time with my brother since we will have no communication for 6 weeks. Every time I don’t reply “quickly enough” he will text me “please don’t go now”. 

It’s a bit frustrating and to be quite honest, annoying. I feel like an asshole if I block him... especially because I’m moving to the same city as him and may see him. But at the same time, it doesn’t seem like I’m getting through to him.

1243,Not the A-hole,"Ok. So here's the sitch:  


My folks are old, they are on the way out. Could be a couple of years, could be ten... could be sooner.  


So naturally they want to get their affairs in order and leave a will to divide up their estate to their children. Me and my 3 (older) brothers.   
Their estate consists of, 3 titles of land all side by side. One 12 acre lot (no infrastructure), one 120 acre lot (no infrastructure), and another 110 acre lot (house, pool, carport, underground spring water bore, fruit orchard, multiple unaproved sheds and storage facilities plus more). They also have some shares and savings.

Originally their idea was to leave the 3rd block which has infrastructure to two of my brothers to share, my other brother would get the large undeveloped block and I would get the smallest undeveloped block.

The shares would be divided out somewhat equally based on the value of each bequeathment.  
I wasnt thrilled by this as I would be getting less land than the others, although it does have some redeeming qualities - it has good road access and is easy to connect to the electrical grid. however it is TINY! at least compared to the other blocks and it's much less private and lacks the degree of natural features (rainforest) that I would value in a property.

I have also expressed that I would rather share the main block with one of my brothers than get the smallest block or would rather get the other larger block and less shares.

But tonight my dad showed me a new ammended will in which My oldest brother would get the large and only developed block, one brother would get the largest undeveloped block and I would get the smallest block with my other brother just getting the money.

My oldest brother is already well set up - he has a house that is already paid out in full. He has a business worth potentially millions. He is fuckin loaded relative to the rest of us. He also married a woman of no small means who is also set to inherit a reasonable estate from her elderly and ailing mother.  
But my parents are christians - and in the bible the oldest son gets the largest inheritence.

I don't have a house. I don't really have any savings at all. I am paying off $20,000 of debt with my partner to help keep her in the country so we can be together. She has no prospects of inheriting anything at all as her parents own practically nothing. And I think this new will is Bullshit. 

I told my dad as much. In gentler words (slightly).

But he thinks I'm being ungrateful. That many people don't get anything and that I'm getting something and should be happy with what I get and shouldn't see any issue with the new will.  


Am I the asshole for thinking this is unfair and saying as much?",55,36,0.81,AITA because I want an equitable will?,dp67qw,2019-10-30 12:43:54,NTA,2730,AITA
19645,Not the A-hole,"So for context, I (20M) came out as gay to my parents in February last year. My mum was very accepting and kind but my stepdad was very much not so. He hates everyone that isn't straight and white, so me coming out as gay made me a disappointment in his eyes.

Fast forward a couple of months and my mum wanted to meet my boyfriend (now ex) so I did the ~300 mile round trip to drive me and my bf to meet my parents. My stepdad decided to send me a list of instructions on how to behave, which in short was basically ""no PDA and no signs at all you're dating"", which really hurt but we went along with it.

My mental health declined sharply over the next 7-8 months as everything for me went wrong. I broke up with my bf, got hit in a car crash and couldn't take the stress from work anymore. To say the least, my stepdad was not happy about me moving back in after losing my job and being unable to live in another town.

My mental health is improving now, but my relationship with my stepdad is heavily stained. We barely talk and I avoid him as much as I can.

Anyway, on topic - since I'm now living with my parents again I've been forced to spend time with my stepdad, much to both of our annoyance. Since I know he's a massive homophobe and hates me for it I decided to add some colour to my room. I have pinned up a 4×2 ft pride flag on my wall and replaced the strings on my guitar with multi-coloured ones. To say the least, he hates it. He has gotten worse with not just me but my mum and brother. Him and my mum have gotten into arguments over his disapproval of my sexuality and I hate that they are getting into arguments over me.

My mum has said that it was bad of me to put this stuff up as I knew it would annoy him, especially as he has gotten worse for everyone and I am refusing to remove the pride stuff from my room.

**Edit:**

Thanks guys, I appreciate you all taking the time to pass verdict on me and my situation.

I have read every comment made here, and regardless of the vote counts on them I have considered what each of you have to say.

Whilst it is nice to see that the majority side with me being NTA here, I have taken into account the opposing points made, by the people who voted ESH or YTA and also people voting NTA.

General consensus is I could have handled this better. And you're right, I could have. I don't dispute my role in this situation and that if I'd have handled this better things wouldn't be so bad. Now I could ramble excuses here about the difficulties of being gay, or how my mental health was playing with me and so on but that isn't relevant here, as I came here for subjective opinion and not emotional sympathy. So thank you for the subjective opinions, as I did find it worthwhile to read, as hard as reading it can be.

I also want to say thanks to you guys for the kind words and support you have, because as much as I hate to admit it I have not been in a great place recently so reading the kind things you guys were saying helped a lot.

I also want to give my thanks to those of you who gave constructive points. Some of them were hard for me to read but I think I needed to hear it.",31,94,0.88,AITA for using pride colours to spite my homophobic stepdad?,h84mp2,2020-06-13 09:53:30,NTA,3202,AITA

9740,Not the A-hole,"**Removed visual  for privacy after several posts.**

I work from home in a condo building with assigned parking for owners around the sides of the building, which also shares a driveway with two surrounding buildings on either side.

This morning I went out to run some errands and grab lunch, came back to find a car parked in the entrance to the driveway, blocking my access to my parking space beside. As soon as I pulled up I saw a lady from the neighboring building leaving it and carrying boxes to the car, she saw me, shook her head and motioned me to park elsewhere. I rolled my window down, explained she was parked in a drive way and blocking my access to my paid and assigned parking space, I made the point that she surely wouldn't block someone's house driveway to move her things and that was effectively what she was doing to me.

A younger guy (I'm 26, he was 20) followed behind and told me they weren't moving until they were done with those boxes, ""tough shit, (they) don't give a fuck."" I said ""No, you're going to move your fucking car, it's blocking my private property and that's illegal"". The lady again repeated that it wasn't happening, I said ""wow, fuck you then"". The guy suddenly runs at me, I barely closed my window in time as he's right up to the door with his hands in the air asking me who the fuck I think I am, cursing me out, yelling.

I drove away shaken because I didn't expect that kind of escalation for a parking dispute, he chased my car down the middle of the street until the end of the block. I called the police non-emergency line to report it because I was afraid they'd damage my car next time they saw it and I wanted a record. I kind of expected they'd just take a report and tell me it's a civil issue, but they sent 3 cops who took statements from me and them. I told them what I wrote here, the neighbors said I showed up swearing and yelling at them to move immediately and the guy ""over-reacted to seeing his step-mom talked to in such a way"" even though they were rude and dismissive to me from the start and I reacted emotionally once it was clear they weren't going to move. One of the officers I was giving my statement to said that my version of events made a lot more sense as to how the situation would escalate. No one was arrested and I'm not sure what they said to them once I went inside after giving the statement.

I've been wondering if calling the cops was an over-reaction, I've had a lot of issues with other people from their building (drunk hitting/running my car, screaming in the alley at 3 am etc) and maybe this influenced me when should have just let it go.

1530,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account because this is a controversial topic. 

Anyway my girlfriend and I have been dating for the last year or so and things have been going good. I'd say things are moving forward at a decent pace in the relationship.

However, about 2 months ago we ran into a problem. She had missed her period and took a pregnancy test and revealed that she was pregnant. We used a condom, but I think I leaving it in the car and the heat most of weakened its integrity or something. Anyway, after a lot of discussion we decide that an abortion is the best option for us. So we go through the process and the procedure. 

There weren't any complications which is a relief. However, the procedure wasn't cheap, so somehow her parents must have found out about it from her bank bill. They lose their shit partially due to their beliefs and being kept in the dark (which was because of their beliefs.) 

Now, her father is calling me talking about how a real man takes responsibility and how I  murdered his grandchild and how could I keep him in the dark about this (can't imagine why). 
Im not sure what would be a productive step at this point.

Going into the relationship, we each had a dog.

The relationship started out house to house, then she got her place renovated and moved into my place, which took about 18 months. Us, two dogs and housemate all living together.

Her reno got completed, and we moved into her nice house about a year ago. (Rich parents)

It has all been going well, but my dog is a bigger rescue (ridgeback/staffy x) and has been causing increasing strain. She has social anxiety as she was beaten as a puppy, barks at guests which can be scary, is overly attached to me, keeps messing up the veggie garden, my partner can't walk her cause she has shown some aggression to other dogs and is too strong etc.

She has now asked me to get rid of the dog, and while I have told her she is more important to me, and I understand her position. I am struggling with it and feel like I am building some animosity about it despite my best efforts not to.

I know my dog sucks, but she got me through depression where I would have wouldn't be here without her. So I feel deeply bonded to her as an animal, and now I am struggling even to look my puppy in the face.

Edit:  Should have included we are only at this point after putting in a lot of work and training.She is a really well-behaved dog when not under stress but carrying deep trauma and is very physically strong and imposing.

Josh and I met Julie at a Comic-Con event in our city when we were all 18-19 age. Josh and Julie immediately hit it off because of their shared humour, ambitions and interests. They have been inseparable ever since!

They get on great, they never argue and are really mature people. They value things like compromising and apologising and honestly I hope I can have a relationship like theirs one day.

However, it's because of their maturity I was pretty floored by what they want to name their daughter who is due in a fortnight...

Annie Mae, as in after Anime.

They felt that the two traditional names would mask the true meaning, whilst reflecting how they met like a little 'easter egg' sort of thing.

I worry that saying something would make me an arse because the traditional names may well be enough to mask the Anime association, particularly for those who don't know. I can't help but wonder how long it would have taken me to notice had they not said?

Also, she would go by Annie Lastname. The Mae part is only going to be a middle name so unless people had to know (e.g. her future teachers) they would probably never find out.

What's more is that, when written down I don't think it's actually all that obvious. I really don't want to upset two excited soon-to-be parents over absolutely nothing, but I worry this could get her picked on once people her age could make the connection.

(Added info: Julie and Josh were both abysmally bullied in high school and I know they would be crushed if their kid was ever bullied too. My concern isn't out of malice, it's because I love my friends dearly and I want to protect this loveable, wholesome family with every fibre of my being.)

19240,Asshole,"weird title, and this’ll sound fake, but it’s 100% true. my girlfriend (26F) and i (29M) have been dating for 5 years and have been living together for 1. shes vegan and health conscious and i am too. but here’s where the problem lies.

she really likes proportioned foods. things that are already packaged in small portions to prevent her from over-snacking. that’s normal, but she gets these small apple sauce pouches and these fruit purée pouches, small low calorie snacks that are literally made by Gerber and they’re intended for literal babies. 

she likes them bc to her, they taste good, they’re low calorie, and again, they’re already portioned into small servings. but it’s literally childish. it’s for BABIES. there’s plenty of “adult” foods that are small portioned and low calorie. every time we have family or friends over they always comment on that food being in the fridge and some even question if we have a kid or not. it’s just annoying and unnecessary. 

so i asked her to stop buying these snacks and get something more “grown up” and she simply said “no”. she even tried to show me on her phone that what she’s doing is common and that so many other adults eat these snacks but i wasn’t buying it so it broke into a whole fight, where i was calling her immature and saying she had to grow up (i know, that was rude) and she was saying that im being a dickhead for getting mad at her for something that she says is harmless.

7293,No A-holes here,"About ten years ago, my family took a long trip across the world for a two week long vacation. I was 19 at the time; just starting to lighten up from being a real downer of a teenager. I still think of this trip as a real highlight of my life because sometime during that trip a light bulb went on in my head and I realized what an amazing family I have.

The only souvenir I still have from that trip is a 8ft by 10ft cloth with a rooster embroidered on it. I’ve always liked birds and my family had a chicken coop at the time so it made sense.

I moved to NYC the year before and I had that cloth hanging on the wall over my bed all through college and in my first few apartments after college. Three years ago I moved into my current place that is perfect for me, except for the lack of open wall space to hang a massive cloth. I started dating a girl who ended moving into that place, and she created a drawing of the rooster on the cloth and framed it for a gift for some occasion. I hung the drawing on the wall and have the cloth stored at my parents house a few hours away. 

We date for a few years but break it off pretty amicably in the middle of last year, she finds another place and we both move on with our lives. The only thing remaining of hers in my apartment is the framed drawing. It reminds me of that trip, not of her. 

A few months later, a good friend and I realize we have feelings for each other and we have been dating now for most of this year. I’ve never been happier, I want to spend the rest of my life with this woman and that has been clear to me since soon after this relationship started.

 I never mentioned that the drawing came from my ex because it honestly hadn’t crossed my mind as possibly being weird or something I should mention. We had a little get together with some of my girlfriend’s friends at our apartment last weekend and it was a blast, as usual. My girlfriend’s friend (L) set the whole brunch up. L has been close friends with my current girlfriend since college, but had also met and become friends with my ex in the last year of that relationship. She also seemed unhappy when I started to date my current girlfriend and tried to convince me to give my ex another try. Yesterday, my girlfriend mentions that her friend (L) told her it was super weird that I still had that photo up. I told her the whole truth about it and offered to take it down. She said I should keep it up because it fills the space on that wall nicely.

Even though she told me to keep it up I can’t help but feel like I’m the asshole if I do. She’s the most kind, caring, and compassionate person I’ve ever met so I can definitely see her swallowing whatever she really wanted to say so as not to start a fight. I could just go get the cloth from my parents’ place and fold/cut it and frame it. I just get so much joy when I see that dang rooster I don’t want to take it down until I can replace it.

9754,Not the A-hole,"Background on my condition: 

I have narcolepsy, a condition characterized by excessive sleepiness where your brain is constantly on the edge of REM sleep because my brain doesn’t produce the chemicals it needs to make me feel awake. Even with a good night’s sleep, I’m basically functioning as if I haven’t slept in 2 days. I experience constant tiredness, have hallucinations when I go to sleep and wake up, and can have sleep attacks where I basically can’t keep my head up.

I manage it pretty well. I take Concerta (time-release Adderall that serves as a stimulant) and try to get as much sleep as possible. But it’s still a daily factor in my life. My ex-boyfriend was really great with me. If I got too tired, we’d go home. If I had an occasional bad day health-wise, he’d be patient and even get me food or groceries because I’d be too tired to leave the house. Since he woke up before me, he’d wake me up, remind me to take my meds, and let me go back to sleep so I could wake up with them already active. Even though my ex was great (broke up because of circumstances), I can function fine by myself. He was just a support system. 



Recently, I matched with someone on Tinder and we got talking. We were supposed to go out for drinks tomorrow night but he mentioned that he has narcolepsy. I thought that was kind of cool that there are other people near me with the condition because it’s pretty rare but realized that I could not, under any circumstances, get romantically involved with another narcoleptic.

It’s just one date, but on the chance that we ended up really liking each other, I didn’t want to risk it. My narcolepsy is a huge burden in my daily life and I know how it feels to be constantly tired, occasionally agoraphobic, and definitely helpless on some days. If I end up with someone, I’d like that support system again and to be able to support them in whatever they need as well. But I just don’t want to have narcolepsy take over even more of my life. I’m totally aware a first date is very low commitment but I figured it’d be nicer to cut it off ahead of a meeting to not waste his time.

I sent him the following message: “I appreciate your honesty but I’m also narcoleptic. You seem like an awesome guy but I don’t think it’s a good idea to go out with someone who also has narcolepsy. Two sleepy people can be trouble! I hope you understand and I’m really sorry about this.”

He replied with a whole string of messages saying that I was prejudiced against the disabled and I need to learn how to be more open-minded. 

I considered my line of thinking as logical and genuinely didn’t want to hurt his feelings. Also, I’m confused on how I’m being prejudiced because I have the same condition he has.

AITA by not giving this guy a chance just because we have the same medical issue?

Edit: totally get the obligation to not date whoever you want and I just want to say that I’m not trying to seek validation. I was mainly worried that I’m a discriminatory ass which I certainly do not want to be",80,75,0.91,AITA for not wanting to go on a date with someone with the same medical condition as me (narcolepsy)?,c6p3bn,2019-06-28 20:16:02,NTA,3034,AITA
790,Asshole,"My bf and I have been living together for 4 years, so we’re practically already married but it feels important to him that we make it “official”. I’m not sure that it’s something that’s very important for me but I have nothing against marriage on a whole. I’m the type to always cry at weddings even if they’re just between fictional characters on TV, I find it all very sweet and romantic and I’m totally on board. Btw I say “bf” because he never really proposed, we just sort of started planning our wedding recently.

The thing is, a typical wedding is not really something I want for myself, for various reasons. It all boils down to the fact that I would be highly uncomfortable with a typical wedding. There’s just nothing about it that sounds appealing to me and I want my wedding day to be fun, not feel like a chore. So the only way I can envision us getting married is if we elope and/or it’s just the two of us. Absolutely no one else.

My bf on the other hand thinks that’s the most horrible idea on Earth. He thinks it wouldn’t be a proper or serious wedding if the people he cared about (his parents and siblings) weren’t there. 

We literally just had a conversation about this that ended up with somewhat of a fight and him storming away. He says he just can’t understand the source of my discomfort. Well, I understand and respect the fact that he has a specific vision for his wedding day and I’m fine with us just not getting married if we can’t come to a solution we both like.

20360,Not the A-hole,"So my son's name is Edward. However we decided to call him Teddy as he growled the first time I held him. It was the cutest thing ever. And as Teddy is a common nickname for Edward we thought it'd be cute. 
There were a few family members who didn't like it but still respected our wishes as his parents. 
Except my parents. They only came back into my life after two years because I gave birth. But they refuse to call him Teddy. I have had many arguments over this with them but they refuse again and again. 
My son it 18 months old, he knows the name is Edward, but we mainly call him it when he's in trouble. So them calling him that really confuses him. 
They think the name is ""immature"" and that he ""will be bullied for it"" latter on. But I have known many Teddy's through school and non was ever (to my knowledge) bullied. Heck one was a popular kid.
Anyway, the point is that both I and the father want him to be called Teddy by his friends and family. And if he decides he wants to be called something else when he reaches school age or latter we will respect that. 
There was one point we're I was with my parents and a friend of there's asked me what the baby's name was. I said ""Teddy."" And my father instantly snapped back in an angry tone ""ITS EDWARD. Only YOU call him Teddy."" But that's not true. They are the only ones who don't.
Before you ask, they are not old. In fact they had me young so they are under 50 and I 25. His great grand parents respect our wishes. So being older has nothing to do with this. I know they were terrible parents (I'll save that for another story) but I didn't think they would be terrible grand parents.
Am I the asshole for trying to get them to respect my wishes as a parent?

Edit: I should add that my my parents try to control every aspect of my life and how I raise my child. This is why there was two years that we didn't talk, because I moved in with people they didn't like and couldn't control me anymore. So I guess this my way to try to start taking back control and still have contact with them.

Edit 2:I also chose Edward as his name as I belonged to the most important person in my life and is also the name of my husband's grandfather. But that does not mean I have to call him that. He looks more like a Teddy then a Edward. 
And his father goes by a nickname as well so it's kind of a family thing to go by nicknames.

Edit 3: sorry for so many edits. I'm trying to make this more understandable for everyone. These grandparents use to yell at me for playing ""too loudly l"" when I was playing quietly with legos and just dropped them. They also yell at me for my kid playing too loud. 
On top of that. We will explain his name when he's older. He's a toddler. He won't understand that his real name is Edward and you can't explain that. But calling him Edward when he gets in trouble is no different then calling someone's full name when they are in trouble as most parents do.

Edit 4: last one I promise. I dont hate his legal name. I don't hate others calling him it. But they correct me when it's just us too. That's why I'm hung up on the name. They YELL at ME for calling MY son by a nickname.

12562,Asshole,"TLDR; I was stuck on a plane surrounded by babies. I reclined my seat because the seat in front of me did, and the mother and baby behind me ended up with less space than they wanted. 


I am travelling alone and specifically picked a window seat so that I didn’t have to keep moving for people who needed to get up. I generally hate to be bothered when I fly and ideally the goal is to sleep the entire way. I remember when I was a kid, flying was difficult for me (motion sickness) but my parents didn’t take me on a plane until I was 3 years old and had my own seat. I slept across laps and on the floors because there was never enough space to get comfortable.

The mother and baby sitting directly behind me are also travelling alone and the baby was young enough to fly free on a lap. I understand that travel with a baby is stressful, and I overheard that this was the first time she was travelling without her husband. 

Even before takeoff, the baby (approx 9 mths) was already grabbing my headrest, reaching for my hair, and occasionally kicking the back of my seat. I let it go because you can’t really stop a baby, and who’s going to ask a mother to stop their baby from doing baby things? She did make an effort to stop the baby when she did and I didn’t mind. At this point I didn’t recline my seat because I had enough room. 

Halfway through the flight, the seat in front of me (also a mom and a baby) reclined their seat and having just woken up from a nap, I reflexively reclined my seat in response. I could hear her exasperatedly go “no please!” and I momentarily had second thoughts...until she asked the flight attendant if there was anything she could do about it. I’m feigning sleep to see how this plays out, but the flight attendant just sympathetically said it was a tricky situation. 

The baby then proceeds to try grabbing at my hair again and I can hear the mother saying (probably just exasperation) that she didn’t care anymore...she usually does but she just doesn’t care anymore. At this point I decided to keep my seat reclined and she can just deal with it like how everyone else deals with economy class. She made a couple of passive aggressive comments to her seat mates about space, but quieted down eventually. The baby was super well behaved, but the mom wouldn’t stop talking. I listened to the mom blab, white noise, Moana, and Frozen for the entire 3 hour flight. 

I can’t decide if AITA for wanting the space I paid for, or should I just have been the bigger person and dealt with the reduced space because I can empathize that travelling with children sucks infinitely more than travelling solo. I am not a large person by any means so it wasn’t a matter of needing the space physically, but just wanting the space.",188,135,0.85,AITA for reclining my seat on a plane with a mom and baby behind me?

P and R claim it was a gift, called us all greedy for thinking it should be paid back at all, paid it back, and proceeded to start a different shit storm about my dead grandparents estate. Then, they threatened to file a restraining order against some of the family for (pretty nicely and not too often) attempting to contact them to reconcile after some VERY horrible emails from P and R. We have all been pretty nice to them in spite of some horrible things they said about us regarding our relationships with our dead relatives. 

So we've cut off all contact. I grew up with P and R and their children, spent every holiday, vacations, and just hang out time with them. This sucks, but they refuse to attempt any kind of counseling or reconciliation, and have instead escalated this into a baseless legal battle. 

In their business, R BRAGGED about how he commits light tax fraud by writing off things that are not business related, uses other people's receipts he finds on the ground to write off, and even has written off entire vacations because he went into one store that related to his business and purchased an item. He paid me cash under the table when I worked for him from ages 14-16. He has never been quiet about these things.

My question, is WIBTA if I reported P and R to the IRS in hopes they get audited? It comes purely from a want for revenge for the shit storm they have caused and them wanting to attack us with the legal system, but it's not like what I'd be reporting isnt true.

22060,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I (26M) have been married to my wife (25F) for years, and we have a wonderful marriage. We are incredibly open with each other, and I feel lucky every day that I get to spend with her.

From the very beginning there’s only been one thing that she hasn’t been thrilled about: I enjoy crossdressing. Ever since I was 7 or 8 I’ve enjoyed wearing dresses and other girly outfits. It’s never been something I’ve done crazy frequently, and it has always been in private.

As I got older I naturally wanted to try more things like make-up and such, but I’d never really had an opportunity to (first because of parents, then living at college, etc). I was optimistic at first that my wife (girlfriend at the time) would be accepting, but unfortunately it freaks her out. I get it, and I don’t blame her, it’s definitely not something that everyone (or even most people) understand. I’m a straight male, it’s just something that I enjoy.

Here’s where things get tricky though. For context, I haven’t really dressed up in years because of my wife. Sometimes it comes up in conversation as a joke or something, and I’ll laugh and let it go. But occasionally we’ll actually talk about it, and she generally says two things:

1) She doesn’t really want me to do it around her because she likes my masculine side and doesn’t want to find me unattractive.

2) She doesn’t want me to do it when she isn’t around because she doesn’t want to feel like I’m going behind her back.

I totally get the first point, and I don’t want her to find me unattractive either, but it’s the second point that really puts me between a rock and a hard place.

I want to clarify that crossdressing is not my life, but it is a relatively strong desire that comes and goes. Honestly I think having to bottle it up whenever it does come up makes it worse. I know to a lot of you this probably sounds stupid, but it’s something that makes me happy.

I also wish I had some people to talk to about it. Having some girls that are accepting that could help me with makeup and outfits would be fun, and would allow me to express this side of me that I’m holding back. I really hoped my wife would be that person for me, but it’s looking like that won’t be the case.

So, WIBTA for dressing up and talking about crossdressing to people that aren’t my wife? I really want to emphasize that she is an amazing woman who treats me incredibly well with every other aspect of our lives. I don’t want to betray her trust, I just don’t know if I can go the rest of my life suppressing this.",559,2964,0.94,WIBTA for wearing a dress?,hu4x0y,2020-07-19 18:05:20,NTA,2571,WIBTA

I was dating my (ex)fiance for 7 years, we started going out at 18 and just recently sorta ended things. Last September I had a BBQ and invited my dad and my fiances mom (the bbq was to announce our engagement). It was the first time they met and they apparently started sleeping together and then got married the week after. It was a mess. At first my fiance and I tried to accept it (even though it was hella weird) but then everywhere we went, they would introduce us as brother/sister. So we both decided that we wouldn't talk to either of them and went no contact. It was alright, but it really caused our relationship to go downhill. We eventually decided to not get married until this is sorted out. We no longer live together, but are still sorta together (I really have no idea how to describe our relationship right now.)

&#x200B;

Recently my sister found out that we were no longer together and sent me this message: ""I am so glad you and Fiance are no longer together. It is weird dating our brother anyways, I am so glad that you will be coming to Easter now!""

I did not respond or go to Easter. Nor did my (ex?) fiance. Then my sister called me and told me that family was more important than a petty argument. I honestly feel really justified in my decision but that's why I need an outside opinion. So AITA?

I’m socially awkward, insecure despite being average looking(not ugly but I wouldn’t call myself pretty. Just average.) and just reclusive/quiet when not spoken to. The incredibly shy/introverted and slightly studious type. Henceforth my singleness. I have been asked out many times by boys but they never really interested me? They weren’t my type honestly and I definitely don’t want to lead then on.  I’ve always been pretty straightforward about that. I figured when the time comes, it will come. Sure I would like a relationship but I’m not actively looking.

I’m a recently licensed pharmacist who’s worked the beast that is retail for a while since undergrad. I’m a professional in my field, very personable with my patients and coworkers. That’s all fine. 

I have a cousin(34F) who my mother adores. My cousins husband brought her over years ago from her home country through marriage and they are doing pretty well for themselves with a little child. She depends on her husband and expects him to do all sorts of things to accommodate her preferred living style. New Lexus and home and all that jazz. She works too to support her family so I don’t pry into whatever they do cause its not my business. 

Now this cousin is always asking me “when will you get a boyfriend.”, “your younger sister has a boyfriend already. She surpassed you!”,  and all these snide comments about my love life. Which doesn’t exactly make me happy cause it’s none of their business. This cousin also prefers my sister(who I admit is the fun one in her eyes. while I’m the smart one. Its just the way I see our dynamic and quite frankly I’m okay with it). 

My other family members also bring this up sometimes too. It gets really annoying real quick. I hate it. But I’ve learned to ignore these snide comments and to tune them out. Just remain quiet whenever they bring it up cause there is no use addressing it and I’m a pretty non confrontational person. 

But today I’ve finally had enough and replied “ I make 6 figures a year. I don’t need a man to take care of me or make me happy. I can do it myself. Please stay out of my business” to her being single comment to shut her up. it got incredibly awkward real fast.

Laura and my 13 year old daughter (who I'll call Louise) had a movie night yesterday evening. Everything went fine but when Laura had left I noticed Louise wearing Laura's scarf. I asked her and she said she'd given it to her as a gift since she has loads of other scarves. 

Laura has expensive tastes. The scarf was branded and I googled it. Won't go into detail but this scarf just wasn't in our price range. 

I told Louise to give back the scarf next time she sees Laura. I did this for a few reasons. Firstly, Laura's family are well off enough to afford to throw expensive gifts at people. My family aren't that wealthy. I want Louise to grow up learning the value of money. Also, that scarf is fairly delicate and I'm not sure Louise can be trusted to look after such an item. 

Louise was really upset and both Adam and my husband were very unhappy with me, saying that it's Laura's choice who she gives gifts to. I understand that but I don't think this was an appropriate gift at all.

He was hired to be the employee responsible for our company supply room. His primary responsibility was to take and deliver orders to departments, stock shelves, inventory and reorder supplies. Not the most vital job in our company, but depended on by many departments. 

The employee was frequently 15-30 minutes late to work (13 out of the last 20 days, including today) and would usually use the drop off lines at his oldest kid’s school as the reason, or that his wife had an appointment that ran over and he had to stay home with the kids until she got back.  The only reason why I know his wife just found out she was pregnant was because I verbally addressed the tardiness with him last week, and he said that day he was late because he and his wife had an appointment to find out if she was. He was so excited to share the news. 

He was also reportedly receiving 2-3 personal phone calls each shift through our system, all from his wife (cell phones aren’t allowed; employees leave them in a locker room and can check them during breaks and lunch). I only know this because our receptionist complained about the frequency this week. Apparently the wife would keep calling back if the receptionist was on the other line, and the wife would hang up and call back again if it took more than 30 seconds for the receptionist to track him down in the building. 

The employee was keeping up with his work, so we didn’t think his tardiness and time on the phone was an issue, until a few nights ago. Apparently he was struggling to keep up so he and his two oldest kids would come in after hours to help him catch up on his duties. We were not aware this was happening until we watched security tapes to find out who propped the main office door open two nights ago. He was not clocking in to do this, explaining to me today that this job was everything to his family and that it would be devastating to lose their only source of income.  He propped the door open so his kids could get in – they had been closing the door behind them but this one instance they forgot and the security discovered it. 

When I let him go, he was in tears. I had scheduled a meeting with him this morning to address the phone calls and his continue tardiness; this was supposed to be his written warning meeting. However, leaving the door propped open is an unforgivable offense. I also wasn’t really sure how I was going to address his children in the workplace, doing his work.

My car has a range of 15mpg (less actually cause where college is, is at the top of a mountainous town and always have to drive up a literal mountain) gas prices here are usually 2.90 a gallon - 3.10 a gallon. I figured it would be easier to do a flat 3$ rate so even if it’s higher they only pay 3$ and I use the change from when it was less to compensate for the increase. I was told I was a dick for suddenly charging people after going two months without charging people. So am I the asshole for suddenly changing the rules after two months of no rules?",47,93,0.95,WIBTA: If I charge people 3$ a gallon for gas for every 15 miles we drive?,cjidrb,2019-07-29 22:17:11,NTA,868,WIBTA
6467,Not the A-hole,"For context, I'm a teacher who teaches adults. My students are all older than me. One of my student has just started a business selling her handmade wooden products. I was very supportive and bought 2 items from her (paid $100). I had intended to give them to my father in law for his birthday, but when I received the items, I saw that they were of poor quality. For something that is wooden, the wood has not been sanded or varnished. It is essentially an unfinished product.

I didn't give them to my FIL in the end. 

WIBTA if I told her that her work is not that good? She is a very proud lady, and I don't want to destroy her confidence. She has messaged me to ask me if my FIL likes the presents and I have no idea what to tell her.

Edit: I am sorry guys. I typed this in the morning before rushing to work. I can't change my title. I am aware of the grammar mistakes, and know the irony of my English mistakes. I am sorry once again.",30,107,0.94,WIBTA if I told my student that her products is not good?,cp4lds,2019-08-12 00:09:02,NTA,942,WIBTA
15607,No A-holes here,"This was a couple years ago, with a former roommate, F. We lived in an apartment that did not allow pets, as per the lease. Several cats wandered around the complex, and my roommate ended up taking a liking to a kitten. F would take the kitten inside, feed him, and otherwise care for him any time F was home. He was cute, as all kittens are, but I was always begrudgingly opposed to taking him in, on account of it being a lease violation that could cost us the apartment. F didn't care, and dug in further, getting proper cat supplies, and getting the kitten fixed. He let the kitten out when he was at work and keep him inside otherwise. 

After a few weeks of this, the kitten was attacked by some of the older cats and his stitches from the fixing were torn on top of other severe injuries. F told me that his finances were wiped out from the cat supplies and getting him fixed, and asked me to cover the ~$300 operation, or the kitten would have to be put down due to the injuries. I ended up deciding to decline, as he already owed me a lot of money from backed up bills and I had been opposed to taking in the adorable lease violation in the first place. Without my money, he had to have the kitten put down. This understandably tanked our relationship for the remaining 7 months we lived together.

I bring this up now because I've since moved out and became a cat dad myself, in an apartment that allows it. I grew up with pets, but this is the first one that's actually my own. It's given me a lot more context into his feelings at the time, since it was the first pet he'd ever had in his life, and the pain I caused him as a result of my decision. Was I the asshole after all in this situation?",223,274,0.91,AITA for not giving my roommate money that would have saved his cat's life?,b53pu3,2019-03-25 00:23:16,NAH,1707,AITA
21747,Not the A-hole,"I had a dog when my wife and I got married. I loved her, she was my buddy. When my wife got pregnant, she became increasingly paranoid that the dog would be a danger to the baby. She brought up rehoming, and I refused. She was an ""aggressive breed"", but she was trained. One day, she called me crying at work that the dog ran away and she couldn't run after her. I believed her. I looked for that dog for weeks. I finally just accepted it because we had to go to the hospital to welcome our child and there were just other pressing concerns.

It's been 5 years since then, and we now have three children. I've wanted to get a new dog, but the kids take a lot of energy and time. My wife has always had a new excuse not to get another dog. I found out recently that my dog didn't run away, my wife and her father took the dog to the pound while I was at work because her parents agreed with her about the dog being ""dangerous"".

I'm FURIOUS. She was MY dog, my BABY. She wasn't dangerous. I would never have agreed to that. She probably never got adopted. I'm honestly mad enough to consider a separation if not for the kids and practical reasons. I've told her that the only way to make it up even a little bit is for us to get a dog. She ultimately doesn't want a dog at all, and complained that she would have to do too much with it. I'm not planning to let up on this one this time.",2815,28208,0.95,AITA for giving my wife an ultimatum about getting a dog?,hreyxc,2020-07-15 02:05:19,NTA,1385,AITA
