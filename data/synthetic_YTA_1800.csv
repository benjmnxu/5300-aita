You're the Asshole,"I am a 16f. My cousin, who is 15, has been struggling with his mental health and was recently diagnosed with depression. He’s been open about it with the family, and I really do feel for him. 

Recently, my parents hosted a family gathering, and I thought it would be a good opportunity for everyone to support him. I wanted to lighten the mood, so during dinner, I made a few jokes about how he’s always so gloomy and how he needs to lighten up. I thought it would be funny and would help him feel better if he could laugh at himself a little. 

At first, everyone chuckled, but then I noticed my cousin’s face go pale. He looked really uncomfortable, and my aunt shot me a disapproving look. I kept going, thinking I could turn it into a playful roast, but it just made the atmosphere awkward. My cousin ended up leaving the table in tears. 

Afterward, my parents and some relatives pulled me aside to say that my jokes were inappropriate and hurtful, especially given what he’s going through. I told them I was just trying to be funny and that he should learn to take a joke. Now I feel like everyone is mad at me, and I’m wondering if I crossed a line.

You're the Asshole,"For context: I'm a 28-year-old guy, and I've been dating my boyfriend for about a year now. 

Recently, my boyfriend lost his job due to downsizing, and he's been struggling to find a new one. He’s been feeling really down about it and often talks about how stressed he is about money and the job hunt. I completely understand how tough it can be; I've been working in finance for several years, and while my job can be demanding, I make a decent salary and have a lot of stability.

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been trying to be supportive, but honestly, I’m starting to get a little annoyed. Every time we hang out, he brings up his problems, and it’s becoming a bit of a drag. The other day, I snapped and told him that his constant complaining about being unemployed is exhausting and that he needs to focus on the positives in life. I mentioned how lucky he is to have the time to figure things out and that I’ve worked hard to get where I am, so he should stop whining and just get back to job hunting.

He was really hurt and said that he just needed a supportive partner, not someone who makes him feel worse. Now he’s been distant, and I feel a bit bad, but I think he needed to hear it. AITA?",401,1725,0.55,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_55343,2018-07-19 00:00:00,YTA,1204,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I recently had a big birthday party for my son, who turned 6. I wanted to throw an extravagant celebration to make it special for him, so I went all out with the theme of his favorite superhero. I rented a big hall, hired a magician, and got a huge cake shaped like his favorite character. 

However, about a week before the party, I found out that my cousin's daughter, who is also 6, has a serious allergy to gluten. I knew this, but I thought it wouldn't be a big deal since I was already spending so much on the cake and food. I decided not to make any gluten-free options and instead told my cousin that she could just bring her own snacks for her daughter. 

On the day of the party, I was too busy with the other kids and the activities to really pay attention to my cousin and her daughter. I noticed my cousin looking upset, but I just assumed she was jealous of how great my son’s party was. Later, when my cousin asked me about not providing gluten-free options, I told her that I didn't want to cater to just one person's needs when I had already spent so much money.

Now, looking back, I realize that I might have hurt her feelings and put her daughter in a tough spot. I was just trying to make my son's party perfect, but maybe I should have been more considerate.

You're the Asshole,"I work at a marketing firm where we occasionally have team lunches to celebrate project completions. Last week, we finished a big client project, and the manager decided to treat us to a nice lunch from a popular local barbecue restaurant. However, I’m allergic to most types of meat, and while I appreciate the gesture, I knew I wouldn’t be able to eat anything from the restaurant. 

During the lunch, everyone was enjoying their meals, and I just sat there with a salad I brought from home. As the lunch went on, I noticed that the team left quite a bit of food uneaten, especially the sides like coleslaw and baked beans, since a lot of people were focused on the main meat dishes. Once the lunch was over, the manager mentioned that any leftover food would be tossed out if no one wanted it.

Feeling a bit bold, I asked if I could take home the leftover sides since I could eat those. The manager agreed, and I proceeded to take an entire tray of coleslaw and another of baked beans, thinking it was all fair game since it was going to be thrown away. 

Later that day, a couple of my coworkers expressed that they were disappointed I took so much food when they would have liked to have some leftovers themselves. I brushed it off, thinking they had their fill during lunch. 

Now I’m feeling a bit guilty and wondering if I overstepped. AITA for taking home all the leftover sides when others wanted some too?",989,1433,0.9,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_62637,2024-11-02 00:00:00,YTA,1417,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I have a friend named Mark who I've known since college. Over the years, he's developed a passion for photography and has been working hard to build his portfolio. Recently, he asked me if I would be willing to model for him, as he needed some new shots for his website. I agreed, thinking it would be a fun way to support him.

During the shoot, Mark was super enthusiastic, but I kept joking around and poking fun at his setup. I didn’t mean anything by it, but I think I went a bit overboard. At one point, I suggested that he should just use his phone and that it would probably get the same results. He laughed it off, but I could tell he was a bit annoyed.

After the shoot, I posted a few of the photos he took on my social media, but I made sure to caption them with some sarcastic comments about how I could have done a better job myself. I thought it was funny, but Mark reached out to me later, clearly upset. He told me that my comments made him feel like I was belittling his work, and that it was really disheartening to hear that from someone he considered a friend.

I didn’t think I did anything wrong; I was just trying to be funny. But now my friends are saying I should apologize, and Mark has been distant ever since.

You're the Asshole,"Throwaway account because I don’t want my friends to see this.

So, I recently had a birthday party and invited a bunch of my friends over to celebrate. I planned a nice dinner and had a cake made because I really wanted to have a good time and feel special. I live in a small apartment, and I had invited about 10 people.

On the day of the party, I noticed that my friend Sarah brought her two kids with her. I didn't think much of it at first since I generally like kids, but it quickly became a bit overwhelming. They were running around, making noise, and getting into everything. I was trying to focus on my guests and the food, but they were a huge distraction.

At one point, while everyone was eating, the kids started bouncing on my couch, and I snapped. I yelled at them to get down and not to ruin my furniture. I thought it was a reasonable request since it was my birthday and I wanted to enjoy my space. Sarah looked really embarrassed and tried to calm them down, but I could see she was upset with me, too.

Later in the night, after they had gone home, I heard from a mutual friend that Sarah was upset and felt like I was too harsh on her kids. I honestly don’t feel bad, though. It was my birthday, and I shouldn’t have to deal with kids bouncing on my couch and making a mess at my party.

You're the Asshole,"I recently attended a family gathering for my cousin’s birthday. It was a pretty casual affair, with everyone mingling, eating, and enjoying some games outside. My cousin, who turned 10, was really excited about his new video game console that he had just received as a gift.

While we were all gathered around, my aunt suggested that we set up a mini-tournament with the new console. Everyone was on board, and it was a fun way to get the kids involved and allow the adults to reminisce about their own gaming experiences. However, I took it a step too far.

As we were playing, I made a joke about how the kids were terrible at the game, saying, “You guys are really bad at this! I expected better from the new generation!” I thought it was funny, but my cousin looked really hurt. He had been so excited to show off his new gift and to play with everyone, and my comment seemed to crush his enthusiasm.

A few relatives shot me disapproving looks, and my aunt even pulled me aside to tell me that I was being rude. I brushed her off, saying I was just joking and that the kids need to toughen up. But the atmosphere shifted, and eventually, my cousin ended up leaving to play by himself instead of continuing the tournament. 

Now I realize I might have gone too far with my joke. I didn’t mean to upset anyone, but I felt justified at the moment. Am I the asshole for making that comment, or were they all overreacting to a harmless joke?",974,2925,0.67,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_28762,2023-10-01 00:00:00,YTA,1442,AITA
You're the Asshole,"AITA in the situation below?

So, I recently went to my cousin's birthday party, which was being held at a local park. It was a big family gathering, and there were a lot of kids running around. I have a pretty big ego when it comes to playing games, and I like to be the center of attention.

They set up a small soccer game for the kids, and I thought it would be a great idea to join in and show off my skills. The thing is, I wasn't really thinking about the fact that these kids were all under 10, and I’m in my late 20s and a pretty competitive player. I started playing really aggressively, trying to score goals and even slide-tackling a few of them, thinking it would be all in good fun.

At one point, I went after the ball and accidentally knocked over this 8-year-old girl who was trying to kick it. She fell hard and started crying. Instead of apologizing and helping her up, I laughed and said something like, ""Come on, it's just a game!"" I thought it would lighten the mood, but it just made everyone uncomfortable. 

The parents got upset, and one of them told me to back off and let the kids play. I just shrugged it off and kept playing, but I could see the kids were scared to get close to me after that. I eventually got bored and left early, thinking it was their fault for being so sensitive.

Now I'm wondering if I was the asshole there. I was just trying to have fun, but I guess I took it a bit too far. AITA?",837,580,0.76,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_58590,2021-08-10 00:00:00,YTA,1435,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I recently got a new dog, and he's a bit of a barker. I live in a quiet neighborhood where most people value peace and tranquility, but my dog loves to bark at squirrels, birds, and basically anything that moves outside. I thought it would be okay to let him express himself, so I didn't really try to train him to stop barking.

One day, my neighbor, who has a new baby, came over and asked if I could keep my dog quiet, especially during naptime. I brushed it off, saying that dogs bark and it's natural. I even joked that my dog was just keeping an eye on the neighborhood and protecting everyone. I thought it was a silly request since I had my rights to let my dog be a dog.

A few days later, I had some friends over for a barbecue, and of course, my dog was barking the whole time. My neighbor came over again, looking pretty upset, and asked me to keep the dog inside while we were outside. I laughed and told him he was being dramatic and that my dog was just having fun. I let my friends play with my dog and encouraged the barking because I thought it added to the lively atmosphere.

Now, my neighbor is really angry with me and has even threatened to report me to the HOA. I don't think I did anything wrong; I love my dog and think he deserves to enjoy his time outside, barking and having fun. So, am I the asshole for not keeping my dog quiet and for disregarding my neighbor's request?",384,2017,0.98,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_71020,2020-08-23 00:00:00,YTA,1402,AITA

During the night, we decided to play a board game that involves a little bit of strategy and some luck. As we played, I noticed that Tom was taking the game way too seriously. He kept making comments about everyone’s moves and critiquing them, which I thought was pretty annoying. 

After a while, I couldn’t help but make a joke at his expense. I said something like, “Hey Tom, just because you’re new here doesn’t mean you can lecture us on how to play. Don’t worry, we’ll still let you have a turn.” Everyone laughed, including Sarah, but Tom looked visibly upset. 

I thought I was just being playful and lightening the mood, but after that, Tom didn’t really engage much, and Sarah seemed a bit uncomfortable. Later in the night, she pulled me aside and told me that I was being rude and that Tom was just trying to enjoy the game. I blew it off, saying I was just joking and that he needed to lighten up.

I love her and want her to be happy, but I’ve been feeling a little overshadowed by all the attention she’s been getting.

Around the time she got engaged, I started dating a woman named Sarah (28F). Things were going well, but as Emma’s wedding approached, I felt a bit resentful that all the family conversations revolved around her big day. It made me feel like my relationship with Sarah was being ignored.

To cope with this jealousy, I decided to organize a surprise engagement party for Sarah. I didn’t ask for Emma’s opinion or help because I wanted it to be a surprise. However, I planned it for the same weekend as Emma’s bridal shower, thinking it would be fun and that everyone would be able to attend both events.

When I announced the engagement party, Emma was visibly upset. She said it was inconsiderate to plan something so big during the time she was meant to celebrate her own engagement and that it stole her thunder. I told her it was just a coincidence and that she shouldn't be so self-centered. We ended up arguing, and I felt justified because I wanted my moment too.

Emma eventually canceled her bridal shower due to the stress of the situation, which made me feel guilty, but I still think I did nothing wrong.

Instead of just saying I didn't like them, I thought it would be helpful to suggest something completely different. I ended up suggesting a style that I thought would look better on her and the other bridesmaids, but she was really offended by my suggestion and took it as me trying to take control of her wedding.

I told her that I was just trying to help and that she should be open to other ideas. I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings, but I couldn’t stand the thought of her wedding looking less than perfect. After that, Sarah stormed off and told me that I was being unsupportive and rude.

Alex is not exactly athletic, but he was determined to improve. I created a workout plan for him and set aside time to train together a few times a week.

However, I started to notice that Alex was struggling with the exercises I had been giving him, and he was becoming increasingly frustrated. Instead of being supportive, I began to mock him for his lack of progress. I would make comments like, ""Come on, it's not that hard!"" or ""You really need to stop being lazy if you want to see results!""

My neighbor, who is a single mother, has a young son who is about five years old. He’s a lively kid, always running around and playing, which is fine most of the time.

One day, I was working from home and had a really important video meeting. It was crucial that I be able to focus without distractions. During my meeting, I could hear the kid outside my window, laughing and shouting while playing. It wasn't excessively loud, but it was definitely distracting.

So, I (28F) recently decided to throw a big party at my house to celebrate my promotion. I invited all my close friends and made it a big deal — decorations, a DJ, the whole nine yards. I was really excited about it.

One of my closest friends, Sarah (27F), mentioned to me a few weeks before the party that she wasn’t feeling up for large gatherings and preferred smaller get-togethers. I brushed it off, thinking she was just being shy and would change her mind once she saw how fun the party would be. I even told her how much I would love for her to be there and that it wouldn’t be the same without her.

The day of the party came, and I had everything set up perfectly. I texted Sarah again, reminding her about the party and how excited I was to see her. She responded that she was still feeling anxious and didn’t want to come. I got really frustrated because I had planned this whole event around having my friends there, and I felt like she was letting me down.

In a moment of anger, I called her and yelled about how she was ruining my celebration by not supporting me. I told her she was being selfish and that she needed to stop being so dramatic about social situations. I even guilt-tripped her a bit, saying that it felt like she didn’t care about my accomplishments if she wasn’t willing to celebrate with me.

Recently, he reached out to me and asked if I'd be willing to help him with some behind-the-scenes work, like editing videos and brainstorming content ideas. I thought it was a great opportunity and agreed to help him out, but I also felt like I deserved to be compensated for my time.

After a couple of weeks of working together, I suggested that I should get a cut of the ad revenue since I was contributing creatively. Jake was taken aback and told me that he was only asking for my help as a friend and not as a business partner. I felt frustrated because I was putting in a lot of effort, and I thought I deserved to be recognized for it.

Instead of talking it through, I got upset and started posting on social media about how ungrateful friends can be and how they expect you to work for free. I tagged Jake in a few posts, which he saw. He tried to reach out to me to discuss it, but I ignored him and kept posting. Eventually, he decided to cut ties with me altogether, and now I feel abandoned and hurt.

You're the Asshole,"I (28F) recently went on a group hike with some friends, and things got a bit out of hand. There were about 10 of us, and we decided to hike a popular trail that’s known for its beautiful views. As we were making our way up, we came across a family with small children who were struggling a bit with the steep parts of the trail. 

Instead of just being polite and letting them pass, I took it upon myself to make some comments about how the kids should be more active and how they’d get a real workout if they kept up. I thought I was being funny and encouraging, but the parents looked really uncomfortable. One of them even said, “We’re just trying our best,” but I just laughed it off. I felt like I was motivating them instead of being rude.

Later on, as we took a break at a scenic lookout, I overheard one of my friends saying that my comments were a bit much and that I should have just let it go. I brushed it off, thinking they were being overly sensitive. But then, I started to notice that some people in the group were giving me side-eye, and it made me feel like I was the only one who didn’t think I did anything wrong.

To make things worse, when we were heading back down, I jokingly yelled out, “Come on, kids! You can do it! Keep up!” I thought it was all in good fun, but the parents looked really frustrated, and I could tell they were embarrassed. 

When we reached the bottom, my friends told me that I should apologize for putting down the family, but I felt like I was just trying to lift their spirits.

You're the Asshole,"So, a little while ago, I went out with some friends to a local concert. It was a fun night, and we were all excited to see our favorite band. I was in a good mood and maybe a little too caught up in the moment.

At some point during the concert, I saw this girl standing alone near the front. She looked cute, and in my slightly drunken state, I thought it would be a good idea to walk up to her and strike up a conversation. When I approached her, I introduced myself and, for some reason, I told her that I was a music journalist. I didn’t think anything of it at the time, and she seemed really interested.

We talked for a while, and I mentioned some ""exclusive"" interviews I had done, which were completely made up. I just wanted to impress her. I even suggested that we could hang out sometime to discuss music and maybe get a drink. She gave me her number, and we parted ways after the concert.

Fast forward a couple of days, and I text her. We start chatting, and she seems really excited to meet up. But then, as we were talking more, she asked about the articles I mentioned, and I panicked. I didn’t have any proof or articles to show her, and I ended up stumbling over my words. She caught on that I was lying and got really upset. 

She told me that she felt deceived and that it was really messed up for me to pretend to be someone I wasn’t just to impress her. Honestly, I thought I was being charming and funny, but I can see how it looked from her perspective. I tried to apologize, but she ghosted me after that.

You're the Asshole,"Hello everyone,

I need some perspective on a situation I recently found myself in, and I'm worried I might have been an asshole.

So, I (28M) have a younger sister (22F) who is currently in her final year of college. She's been working really hard and I wanted to support her by treating her to a nice dinner to celebrate her achievements. I planned this surprise dinner with just the two of us at a fancy restaurant that we used to go to as kids.

However, when I arrived to pick her up, I found her sitting with her boyfriend (23M) in our living room. I didn't know he was coming over, but they seemed to be having a nice time together. I told my sister about the dinner plans I had made, and she looked a bit hesitant. 

Instead of being understanding, I insisted that the dinner was planned just for us and that she shouldn’t bring her boyfriend along. I thought it would be a special moment for us to bond, you know, just siblings catching up. I even said, “Don’t you think it would be better if we just had this time for ourselves?”

She ended up feeling really awkward and ultimately told her boyfriend he should leave. The dinner was nice, but looking back, I could see she was a bit upset about having to choose between spending time with me or her boyfriend. I kept bringing up how much she needed to focus on school and her future, but now I think I might have come off as controlling or dismissive of her relationship.

Afterward, she told me she felt bad about how I handled the situation and that I should have been more inclusive. I can’t help but feel like I was just trying to create a special moment for us, but maybe I overstepped. 

So, AITA for not wanting to include my sister’s boyfriend in our dinner?",45,1412,0.93,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_28893,2018-10-11 00:00:00,YTA,1726,AITA

I listened to her concerns, but I couldn't help but share my opinion that maybe she just wasn't trying hard enough to make it work. I told her that sometimes you have to put in more effort to find that spark, even if it isn't there right away.

I suggested that she should make herself more attractive to him, like changing her hairstyle or wearing different clothes. I told her that if she really liked him, she should be willing to do what it takes to keep him interested. I even went so far as to say that if she really wanted the relationship to work, she should plan some romantic gestures to show him how much she cares.

Sarah seemed really upset by my advice and said that she shouldn't have to change herself to make someone like her. I brushed it off and said she was overreacting, but she ended up telling some mutual friends about our conversation. They sided with her and told me I was being insensitive and even sexist for suggesting she should change for a guy.

Now, I’ve never really liked Lisa. She’s nice enough, but she’s also very loud and tends to dominate conversations, which annoys the group. Tom seems really into her, though, so I’ve tried to be supportive and keep my opinions to myself.

Last week, we planned a game night at my place. I spent a lot of time preparing snacks and getting everything ready. The day before, Tom told me that he wanted to bring Lisa along. I hesitated but agreed, thinking maybe I could give her another chance.

When game night came around, Lisa showed up and immediately started taking over the games we had planned. She kept suggesting her own games and dismissing our ideas, which frustrated everyone, but I tried to keep the mood light. As the night went on, I noticed that she was really loud and didn’t seem to care about our opinions at all.

At one point, I snapped and told her, “This isn’t your game night, Lisa. It’s ours, and if you want to play your games, maybe you should just host your own.” I thought I was being funny, but the mood shifted instantly. Tom looked really upset, and Lisa just left the room in tears. He followed her, and I felt bad, but I also thought someone needed to put her in her place.

After they left, the rest of the group said I went too far and that I should have just let it go or talked to Tom privately about my feelings. I thought I was standing up for our friend group, but clearly, I misjudged the situation.

I have a younger sister, Emily, who has always been super into arts and crafts. She’s been working on this massive painting for a local art competition for weeks. She’s put in a ton of effort, and everyone in the family was cheering her on. The prize was pretty significant, and she really wanted to win.

Now, I’ve always been a bit of a jokester, and I thought it would be funny to prank her right before the big day. I decided to take her painting, just for a couple of hours, and put it in a random location in the house, pretending I had no idea where it was. I thought it would be hilarious to see her panic for a moment before I revealed it was just a prank. 

Well, when I took her painting and hid it, she freaked out. She was running around the house, searching everywhere, and I could see how distressed she was. I never intended for it to go that far—I thought she would just laugh it off when I finally told her. But when I did reveal the prank, she didn’t laugh at all. She was really upset and said I had crossed a line, especially since it was something so important to her.

I thought I could just brush it off, but then she started crying and said I ruined her focus and made her feel terrible right before the competition. She ended up not being able to finish her final touches on the painting in time, and I felt awful. She didn’t even want to talk to me for days after that.

While I was there, I saw some of her friends and family complimenting her work, and I just couldn’t hold back my thoughts. I ended up making a comment during the showcase, saying something like, “I don’t get why people are saying this is so great; it looks like something a kid would paint.” 

The room went silent. My sister’s face dropped, and I could see her getting really upset. After the showcase, she confronted me about what I said. I told her I was just being honest and that I thought she could use some constructive criticism. I honestly believed that if she really wanted to sell her art, she needed to hear the truth instead of being coddled by everyone else.

I was really happy for them at first, but things quickly took a turn when I found out that their engagement announcement was going to be a surprise event—a small gathering with close family and friends.

Now, here’s where I messed up. A few weeks before the engagement party, I was hanging out with my brother, and we were reminiscing about our childhood. In a moment of honesty, I told him that I never liked his girlfriend very much. I think she’s nice, but I’ve always felt that she doesn’t really fit into our family dynamics. I shared some offhand comments about how I thought she was a bit self-centered and that I didn’t see the chemistry between them. I should have kept my mouth shut, but I just blurted it out.

Fast forward to the engagement party. It was a lovely event, and everyone was excited. However, when my brother and his girlfriend shared the news and toasted to their future, I felt compelled to say something in front of everyone. I stood up and jokingly said, “I hope you two don't think this is a mistake. I’ve always thought you could do better, man!” The room went silent, and I realized I had just killed the vibe.

My brother looked devastated, and his fiancée was clearly hurt, too. I tried to laugh it off, but my brother asked me to leave the party. I felt awful but justified, thinking I was just being honest and trying to protect him.

I was happy for her and supportive, but I won’t lie—I had some reservations. I didn’t know him well, and I was worried he might not treat her right, so I casually mentioned to her that I had my doubts.

I mentioned how he used to be a ""freeloader"" when they first started dating, living off my sister while he figured out his life. 

I didn’t think much of it at the time; I was just joking around. My sister, however, looked visibly upset. She later pulled me aside and told me that I had ruined the moment for her and embarrassed her fiancé in front of everyone. I tried to explain that I was just joking and didn’t mean any harm, but she wasn’t having it. She said I should have respected their relationship and not brought up the past, especially since he was working hard now.

It felt awkward, and I didn’t want to make it about me, so I just smiled and pretended to be enjoying myself.

Jake is a pretty straightforward guy, and I've always found him likable. However, I think he can be a bit boring and too serious at times, which is why I never really saw him in a romantic light. Nonetheless, Sarah is smitten, and I'm happy for her.

You're the Asshole,"I (28M) have a coworker, let's call him Mark, who has been working with me for about a year. We usually get along well, but he can be a bit awkward in social situations. Recently, Mark invited some colleagues to his birthday party. I was planning on going, but I had to work late that day, and I texted him to let him know that I might not be able to make it.

Mark messaged me back, saying that it would be fine if I showed up late and that he would keep the party going until I got there. I appreciated that, but I honestly didn’t think I'd make it at all.

Fast forward to the evening of the party. I got off work late, and by the time I got to Mark’s place, it was already pretty late. I walked in and saw that the party was winding down. Most people were leaving, and it felt a bit awkward. I thought about turning around and leaving, but Mark saw me and insisted that I stay.

At that point, I figured I should at least make the most of it, so I grabbed a drink and started chatting with a couple of other guests. The vibe felt off, though, and I could see that Mark was kind of sulking in the corner. I guess he was disappointed that more people left early.

Feeling bad, I decided to lighten the mood. I started telling some jokes and stories about work, but I could tell they weren’t landing. Instead of reading the room, I kept pushing forward. At one point, I made a joke that I thought was funny, but it was a bit too personal about Mark's awkwardness at work. I thought it would make everyone laugh, but instead, Mark looked hurt.

After that, the atmosphere got even more uncomfortable. People started leaving faster, and I felt terrible. I tried to apologize to Mark later, but he just brushed it off. I think he was really upset, and I could tell I had embarrassed him in front of his friends.

Now I’m left wondering if I was a total jerk for trying to make the party fun when it clearly wasn’t a good time for Mark. AITA for trying to be funny and ending up hurting my coworker’s feelings on his birthday?",36,1562,0.97,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_39095,2022-07-14 00:00:00,YTA,2023,AITA

She's been super excited about it, and I can’t blame her; I remember how thrilling it was for me to start my career. However, she recently asked me if I could help her out financially for a few months as she adjusts to her new salary, which is lower than what she expected. 

I have a pretty good job and make decent money, but I also have my own financial goals and obligations, including saving for a house. I know she’s still figuring out her budget, but I really don’t think it’s a good idea to help her out. I told her that while I’m happy for her success, I just can’t afford to give her any money, especially since I’m saving up for my future.

She took it pretty hard and said that she felt like I wasn’t supporting her during a challenging transition in her life. I could have offered to sit down with her and help her create a budget instead, but I just didn’t want to get involved. I thought that if she really needed support, she should find ways to adjust on her own or ask our parents.

The next day, she posted online about how disappointed she was in her brother, which made me really upset. I felt like I was being unfairly criticized for trying to be financially responsible. I talked to a few friends about it, and they said I was right to prioritize my own finances.

You're the Asshole,"A few weeks ago, I attended a friend’s wedding as a plus-one. The wedding was beautiful, and everything seemed to be going well until the reception. At our table, I noticed that one of the bridesmaids, who I’d never met before, was sitting alone and looking a bit uncomfortable. I decided to engage her in conversation to help her feel more included.

As we talked, I learned that she was actually the bride’s cousin and had flown in from out of town. She seemed really nice, but I quickly became annoyed when she started to share her opinions about the wedding. She mentioned that she thought the flowers were tacky and the music choices were outdated. I felt embarrassed for the bride and groom, who had worked so hard to make the day special.

In a moment of frustration, I interrupted her and said, “You know, if you’re going to be negative, maybe you should just keep your opinions to yourself. This is their day, not yours.” She looked taken aback, and the conversation went cold. I could see her trying to hold back tears, and I immediately realized I had gone too far. 

After that, I just ignored her for the rest of the evening and spent my time dancing and mingling with other guests. A few days later, I texted my friend to tell her I had a great time, but I vented a bit about how I couldn’t believe some people had the audacity to be rude at such a joyful occasion. My friend responded by telling me that the bridesmaid was actually going through a tough time and didn’t mean to offend anyone. 

Now, I feel pretty bad for my outburst. I know I could have handled that situation better, maybe by redirecting the conversation or just letting her speak without being so harsh. I guess I was just caught up in wanting to defend my friends. So, AITA for calling out the bridesmaid at the wedding?",598,1177,0.61,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_76580,2024-06-29 00:00:00,YTA,1806,AITA
You're the Asshole,"TLDR; I refused to help my friend with her wedding planning because I didn't like her choices and told her she should just listen to me since I have “better taste.”

I have a close friend, Sarah, who recently got engaged and is in the process of planning her wedding. She asked for my help because she knows I have a knack for event planning and design. At first, I was excited to help her out, but as we started discussing ideas, I quickly realized that her vision for the wedding didn’t align with what I thought was “good taste.”

For example, she wanted to have a rustic-themed wedding with burlap and mason jars, which I personally think looks cheap and overdone. I suggested more elegant decor options, like silk table linens and crystal centerpieces, but Sarah was adamant about her choices. I found myself getting frustrated because I felt like she wasn’t taking my advice seriously, despite my experience.

One day, while we were discussing the guest list, she mentioned inviting some of her college friends who I think are just a bad influence on her. I voiced my opinion, saying that those friends would bring down the overall vibe of the wedding and suggested she just not invite them. She was upset and said it was her day and she wanted to celebrate with the people she loved, but I insisted she should see it my way for the betterment of the event.

Eventually, I told her that if she was going to stick to her “poor choices,” I wouldn’t help her anymore. I felt that if she didn’t want to take my advice, then she didn’t deserve my help. I just wanted what was best for her wedding, and I thought she should appreciate my insight.

Now, she’s really hurt and has told me that I’ve been controlling and unsupportive. She’s considering not involving me in any more of the planning, which I think is unreasonable, as I was only trying to help. I don’t understand why she can’t see that I have her best interests at heart.

I feel like I’m in the right because weddings are important, and I truly believe I know better when it comes to creating a beautiful event. But now she’s saying that I’m the problem, and I’m not sure if I misstepped here.",468,2234,0.51,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_56586,2022-04-23 00:00:00,YTA,2157,AITA
You're the Asshole,"So, I (28M) have a close friend named Sarah (27F). We've been friends for about five years, and we hang out a lot. Sarah is really into fitness and has been trying to promote a healthy lifestyle, which I totally support. However, it seems like her dedication has turned into a bit of an obsession.

Lately, Sarah has been on this strict diet and has been very vocal about it. She often posts on social media about her meals and workouts, and she even encourages her followers to join her “clean eating” challenges. At first, I thought it was great that she was motivating people, but then it started to feel excessive.

A few weeks ago, we decided to have a movie night at my place. I planned to order pizza and get some snacks. When I told Sarah about the plan, she immediately made a face and said she couldn’t eat that kind of food. I suggested we could get a healthy pizza or something, but she insisted on bringing her own food instead. I thought it was a bit much, but I didn’t want to ruin the night, so I agreed.

When she arrived, she had this massive Tupperware filled with a quinoa salad and grilled chicken. I tried to make her feel comfortable by saying, “Wow, that looks great! I’m excited to try it!” She responded with, “Yeah, I just can’t let myself indulge in junk food. It’s not worth it.”

As the night went on, I noticed she kept making comments about the pizza and snacks I had. She would say things like, “I can’t believe you’re eating that,” and “You really shouldn’t eat so much processed food, you know.” I felt really judged and uncomfortable, but I tried to brush it off.

Finally, I snapped and said, “You know, it’s just pizza. You don’t have to act like it’s poison.” She got really defensive and said I was being disrespectful of her lifestyle choices. I told her that I was just trying to enjoy a movie night and that she didn’t need to make me feel bad about my food choices.

After that, the mood was completely ruined, and she left shortly after. Now she’s been giving me the cold shoulder and hasn’t responded to my texts. I feel bad for how I reacted, but I still think she was being overly critical.

You're the Asshole,"I (28F) recently had a big blowout with my younger brother (25M) over a family event. We had planned a surprise birthday party for our parents, which I was really excited about. I took charge of organizing everything—booking the venue, sending out invites, and even arranging the catering. 

My brother was supposed to help, but he kept making excuses and didn’t contribute much at all. A few weeks before the party, he mentioned that he wanted to bring his new girlfriend along. I was fine with this at first, but then he asked if she could be the one to help with decorations and set up instead of him. I thought this was unfair, especially since he didn’t help with anything else, and I told him that I wanted the people who had been involved in planning to do the setup, not just someone I’ve never met.

He got really upset and accused me of being controlling and not wanting to include his girlfriend. I told him that it was my party to organize, and I wanted it to be special for our parents without any random involvement. I thought I was justified in wanting to keep it a family affair.

Fast forward to the day of the party, and my brother showed up late and visibly upset. He didn’t even say hi to me before storming off to the corner with his girlfriend. I felt a bit bad, but I still thought I was in the right for wanting things to go my way. After the party, he texted me saying he felt unwelcome and that I made it clear he wasn't needed.

You're the Asshole,"A few months ago, I (28F) was invited to my cousin's wedding. She’s been with her fiancé for several years and they finally decided to tie the knot this summer. We’ve always been close, so I was really excited for her and immediately marked the date on my calendar.

A couple of weeks ago, I found out that my cousin had chosen a date for her wedding that falls on the day of my best friend’s birthday party. My best friend has been planning this birthday bash for months; it’s a big milestone for her, and she’s really been looking forward to it. 

I spoke to my cousin about it, and she was really understanding. She even said that I could skip the wedding and come to the party instead. But I didn’t want to miss my cousin’s special day, so I told her that I would try to make both events work.

As the wedding day approached, I felt increasingly torn. I told my best friend that I would definitely come to her party after the wedding, but I started to feel guilty because I felt like I was splitting my time between the two of them. 

On the day of the wedding, I went to the ceremony and took plenty of pictures, but I ended up leaving right after the vows and the first dance because I was worried about getting to my best friend’s party on time. When I arrived at the party, my friend was excited to see me, but I could tell she was a bit disappointed that I missed most of the wedding.

Later, I posted a few pictures from the wedding on social media, tagging my cousin but not mentioning my friend’s party. This seemed to upset her, and she confronted me about it. I told her that I was just trying to celebrate my cousin's big day, and I didn’t see the harm in it.

You're the Asshole,"My girlfriend and I have been together for three years, and we live together. We both have jobs and contribute to household expenses fairly evenly. We enjoy planning trips together and often go out for dinners and activities. Overall, I consider us to be great partners, but there’s one issue that has recently come up that I’m struggling with.

My girlfriend loves to spoil her friends. She often treats them to dinners, buys them gifts, and helps them out financially when they’re in a bind. I admire her generosity, but I’ve noticed that she tends to spend a lot of money on them, sometimes even more than she spends on us. I’ve brought it up a couple of times because it bothers me that she prioritizes their needs over our own plans.

For instance, we had discussed going on a weekend trip together next month, something we’ve been looking forward to for a while. But just last week, she told me she had given $200 to a friend who needed help with rent. I was shocked because that’s a significant amount of money, especially right before our trip. I felt like our plans were being compromised for her friends, and I expressed my frustration. 

I told her that while it’s great to be generous, she needs to consider our budget and our plans too. I was a bit harsh in my tone and suggested that she should focus on spending on our relationship rather than trying to save the world. I even went as far as to say that if she continues to prioritize her friends, maybe we should rethink how we manage our finances moving forward.

She got really upset and said that it’s her money and she should be free to spend it how she wants, especially since she works hard for it. I tried to explain that I just wanted her to be more mindful about how it affects us, but I could see that she felt I was being controlling and unsupportive of her kindness.

Looking back, I realize I may have come off as selfish and unsympathetic to her feelings. I do appreciate her generosity, but part of me feels like she should be more focused on our relationship.

You're the Asshole,"My girlfriend and I recently had a big argument over the way I handle my 10-year-old nephew when he comes to visit. My sister, his mom, has been trying to encourage him to be more self-sufficient and responsible, so she asked me to help out by giving him some chores to do when he's at my place. Things like cleaning his room, helping with the dishes, or even walking the dog.

When he came over last week, I decided to take a more laid-back approach. I just let him play video games and watch TV while I cooked dinner. Later, my girlfriend asked me why I hadn't given him any chores, and I told her I just thought it was more fun to let him relax while he’s here. She was really upset and said it was important for him to learn responsibility and that I was doing him a disservice by not encouraging him to help out.

I didn’t think it was a big deal. After all, he’s just a kid, and he should have the chance to enjoy his time without being burdened by chores. I told her that my sister didn’t raise him that way and that I didn’t want to impose my own ideas of responsibility on him. My girlfriend argued that if I didn’t help instill good habits in him now, he would struggle later in life.

I felt like she was overreacting. I mean, he’s only 10! He’ll have plenty of time to learn about chores and responsibility when he’s older. Plus, I want him to remember coming to my house as a fun escape rather than a place where he has to work. I told her she could just lighten up and let him be a kid for a while.

After our argument, I’ve noticed she’s been getting annoyed with me every time he comes to visit. I don’t think I’m in the wrong, but the way she talks about it makes me feel like I’m somehow failing him. I just want him to have fun when he’s with us!

TLDR: My sister asked me to give my 10-year-old nephew chores when he visits to teach him responsibility. I let him play instead because I think he should just enjoy being a kid.

At some point during the night, I overheard two of my friends (let’s call them Sarah and Tom) talking about their recent trip to Europe. They were sharing some funny stories and seemed to be having a great time.

I decided to jump into their conversation to share a story of my own from my last vacation. However, I got a little too excited and started talking over them. I remember interrupting Sarah while she was in the middle of telling a funny story about getting lost in Paris, and I tried to tell my own story about a time I got lost in Rome. Instead of listening to her, I kept going on and on about my experience.

After a few minutes, I finally noticed that Sarah looked visibly annoyed, and Tom was trying to get a word in but couldn’t. Instead of reading the room, I just kept talking. I thought I was being funny and engaging, but I could tell that the vibe had shifted. Eventually, Sarah just sighed and said, “Can you let me finish my story for once?” I laughed it off, thinking it was a joke, but she didn’t laugh back.

I ended up telling her that if I can't afford it, I won't be able to be in the wedding. She got really upset and said I was being selfish and unsupportive. I feel bad for making her upset, but I also think I shouldn't have to go into debt just to be a part of her wedding.

However, with this promotion, I've started to feel a bit superior to my friend. He’s still working part-time jobs while trying to make it big in music, and while I respect his passion, I can’t help but feel a bit embarrassed about his situation.

A couple of weeks ago, we went out for drinks to celebrate my promotion. During our conversation, I couldn't help but brag about my new salary, my achievements, and my plans for the future. I mentioned how my work is so much more stable than the unpredictable life of a musician. My friend started to look uncomfortable, but I thought he was just being modest.

He told me that he felt like I was belittling his dreams, and that really struck a nerve. I brushed it off, thinking he was just being overly sensitive.

Since then, I’ve noticed he’s been distant. I just don’t understand why he’s taking my comments so seriously. I mean, I was just sharing my excitement about my life and trying to motivate him! I thought friends uplift each other, and maybe he just needs to be reminded of the importance of having a stable job.

I was feeling particularly generous that day, and as a joke, I said I was going to pay for Sarah’s meal as a “thank you” for always being so nice. 

Sarah laughed and said I didn’t have to do that, but I insisted. I thought it was a fun gesture, and since I was in a good mood, I felt like treating someone who deserved it. However, when the bill came, I ended up paying for her meal, which was significantly more expensive than what the rest of us ordered. 

After that lunch, I noticed that Sarah had been treating me differently. She started inviting me to join her for coffee breaks and asked if I wanted to go out for lunch again, but only if I was okay with paying for her meal. At first, I thought it was just her being friendly, but I quickly realized that she seemed to expect me to cover her every time we went out. 

Eventually, I felt taken advantage of and snapped at her after she suggested I pay for her meal again during a work lunch. I told her that I was no longer going to pay for her just because I had done it once. She looked hurt and said I was being rude because it was just a casual suggestion. I brushed it off and told her to stop expecting me to pay for her meals. 

Now, she seems to avoid me, and our friendship feels strained. My coworkers have commented that I might have been harsh, but I felt like I was just standing my ground. I can’t help but think she was being manipulative.

TLDR: I jokingly paid for a coworker’s meal once and now she expects me to pay for her every time we go out. I snapped at her when I refused to pay again, and now she’s avoiding me. I’m not sure if I overreacted.",560,2517,0.66,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_94106,2021-12-29 00:00:00,YTA,2118,AITA
You're the Asshole,"My best friend, Sarah, recently had a baby girl and named her Emma. I think it's a beautiful name and I was really excited for her. However, I’ve taken it upon myself to call the baby ""Emmy"" because I think it sounds cuter and more playful. 

When I first started calling her Emmy, Sarah smiled but didn’t say anything. I took that as a sign that she was okay with it. But as time went on, I noticed Sarah kept referring to her daughter as Emma and would sometimes correct me when I called her Emmy, saying, “Her name is Emma.” I thought she was just being a little too serious about it.

One day, at a gathering with friends, I introduced her to everyone saying, “This is little Emmy!” Sarah looked visibly annoyed and said, “I told you her name is Emma.” I laughed it off, thinking she was just being dramatic.

Then, during another visit, I kept calling her Emmy, and Sarah finally snapped and told me to stop. I got upset and said, “It’s just a nickname! Your daughter is going to have plenty of nicknames and I want to be the fun aunt!” 

I continued to use the name Emmy and even told her, “You should be grateful someone loves your daughter enough to give her a fun name!” Eventually, Sarah and I got into a big argument, and now she’s really upset with me and doesn’t want to talk.

My brother and his wife recently announced they were expecting their first child, and I couldn’t help but express my concerns. Growing up, my brother was always irresponsible. He frequently made reckless decisions, like dropping out of college to travel and not holding down a job for more than a few months. I’ve always been the more responsible sibling, so when he told me about the pregnancy, I felt it was my duty to speak up.

At a family dinner, I brought it up in front of our parents and some other relatives. I said something like, “Are you sure you’re ready for this? You can barely take care of yourself, let alone a child.” I thought I was being helpful, trying to save him from potentially making a huge mistake. My brother got really upset and said I was being condescending and unsupportive. Our parents tried to diffuse the situation, but I insisted that someone needed to say it.

Now, I feel conflicted. I think I was just looking out for him, but I’ve been getting backlash from family members who think I crossed a line. Maybe I should have kept my opinions to myself, but I genuinely believe he’s not ready for the responsibility of parenthood.

During the event, my younger sister, who is 10, was really looking forward to dancing and having fun with the other kids.

As the night went on, my sister got a little too enthusiastic and accidentally spilled her drink all over my aunt's expensive dress. My aunt was understandably upset, and while I felt bad for her, I thought my sister should apologize and take responsibility for what she did.

Instead of being supportive, I made a big deal about it in front of everyone, calling my sister out loudly and saying she was being careless. I thought it would teach her a lesson about being more careful in the future. My aunt ended up being upset with both of us, and my sister started crying.

Looking back, I realize that I probably embarrassed my sister more than I helped her learn a lesson. I could have handled it in a more private way, or at least not made it such a public spectacle.

One day, she came over to vent and talk about how her family doesn’t believe in her career choice. I listened, but I quickly grew tired of the same complaints. Instead of being supportive, I started to dismiss her feelings by saying things like, ""You just need to toughen up,"" and ""It's not that big of a deal.""

I work in marketing and she’s been trying to establish herself as a graphic designer. Recently, she landed a freelance project that she was really excited about—designing promotional materials for a local charity event. I thought it was great for her, but I couldn’t help but feel a twinge of jealousy since I’ve been stuck in my job without any major projects lately.

A few days before the event, she mentioned that she was feeling overwhelmed and asked if I could help her with the marketing strategy for the materials. Instead of being supportive, I decided to sabotage her a bit. I told her that I would help, but then I purposely suggested some ideas that I knew wouldn’t work well and made her second-guess her initial designs. I thought it would make her look bad and give me a chance to shine in comparison.

On the day of the charity event, I showed up and saw her struggling to set up her designs, which didn’t look great because of my “help.” I felt a rush of satisfaction seeing her stressed, but deep down, I knew that it wasn’t right. When the event started, people were complimenting the charity, but I noticed many of them didn’t even notice her designs. I could see the disappointment on her face, and it made me feel guilty.

Later, she confronted me about my suggestions and how they affected her work. Instead of admitting my guilt, I deflected and made excuses, brushing off her concerns. I told her she should’ve known to trust her instincts instead of relying on me. After all, I was just trying to help, right?

I told him that he shouldn’t go on the trip and instead focus on getting his finances in order. I thought I was being helpful, but Jake got really upset and said I was being controlling.

I recently moved into a new apartment complex and was excited to meet my neighbors. I made a point to introduce myself to everyone on my floor, hoping to foster a friendly atmosphere. One evening, I heard loud music coming from one of the units down the hall, and it was quite late. I decided to take matters into my own hands and knocked on the door.

When the neighbor answered, I asked if they could turn it down since it was late, and they politely agreed. However, I then went on to tell them that I thought it was inconsiderate to play music that loud at night, especially since we all live so close together. I mentioned that I expected more respect and consideration from my neighbors.

The next day, I found a note slipped under my door. It was from my neighbor, expressing that they felt hurt by my comments and that they were just trying to enjoy their evening after a long week at work. They mentioned that they didn’t mean to disturb anyone and would be more mindful in the future.

I brushed it off and felt justified in my actions, thinking I was just setting boundaries. Later, I overheard some neighbors discussing how confrontational I had been with my new neighbor. It made me rethink my approach, but I still feel that I was in the right.

I was taken aback because I know she has no job to return to and it would only prolong her financial troubles. I told her I didn’t think it was a good idea and that she should focus on finding a stable job instead. Sarah got upset and accused me of being unsupportive and judgmental. She argued that this trip would help her “find herself” and discover what she truly wants to do with her life.

I maintained my stance, believing I was protecting her from making a mistake. I flat-out told her I wouldn’t lend her the money because I felt it would just enable her to avoid responsibility. Instead, I encouraged her to look for jobs in her field and to use that time to build her resume. She ended up storming out of my house, and I haven’t heard from her since.

We started planning our wedding, and my girlfriend has been very excited about including her family's customs in the ceremony.

You're the Asshole,"I (28F) have a younger brother, Jake (22M), who is currently in college. He's always been a bit of a free spirit and tends to take risks, which has caused some concern for our parents. I’ve always been the responsible one, so my parents often look to me for guidance.

Recently, Jake started dating a girl named Mia. They’ve been together for about six months, and I’ve met her a few times. She seems nice, but I don’t really vibe with her. She’s very into partying and often shares stories about her wild nights out. I voiced my concerns to Jake, telling him that I think he should be careful and focus on his studies instead of getting swept away in this party lifestyle.

A few weeks back, I hosted a family dinner, and Mia came along. I didn’t say much to her during the dinner, but I made a couple of comments about how I was surprised that Jake was spending so much time with her, given her lifestyle. I thought I was just looking out for him, but I noticed that Mia seemed a bit uncomfortable, and Jake looked really upset.

After dinner, Jake confronted me and said I was being rude and judgmental. I brushed it off and told him I was just trying to protect him from making bad decisions. He ended up leaving the dinner early with Mia, which made things really awkward for everyone else.

Now, my parents are upset with me too, saying I should have been more supportive of Jake’s choices and that I overstepped. I still feel justified in my actions, thinking I was just trying to help him, but I can see how it might have come off as harsh.

You're the Asshole,"So, I (28F) recently got into a new relationship with my boyfriend (30M), and things have been going really well. We enjoy spending time together and have been talking about moving in together. However, there's something that happened recently that has me reflecting on whether I overstepped.

My boyfriend has a close-knit group of friends that he’s known for years, and they often hang out together. One of his friends, Mike, has a reputation for being a bit of a womanizer and is known to make some questionable comments about women. My boyfriend has always assured me that he doesn’t approve of Mike's behavior, but he still hangs out with him and the group regularly.

Last week, I decided to surprise my boyfriend by organizing a small get-together with his friends at our place. I wanted to make a good impression and show that I was supportive of his friendships. However, I was also determined to express my discomfort about Mike's attitude, especially since I overheard him making some inappropriate jokes about women during a previous gathering.

At the party, after a few drinks, I brought up Mike’s behavior in front of everyone, calling him out for the jokes and comments he makes. I thought it would be an important discussion for the group, but it turned into an awkward silence. My boyfriend was visibly uncomfortable, and his friends seemed taken aback that I would bring it up like that, especially in front of everyone. My boyfriend later pulled me aside and told me that he appreciated my concern but felt that I embarrassed him in front of his friends. 

I thought I was doing the right thing by standing up against behavior I found disrespectful, but now I’m questioning if I overstepped my boundaries with his friends. AITA?",85,1329,0.93,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_61489,2021-02-19 00:00:00,YTA,1748,AITA
You're the Asshole,"So, I’ve been living with my girlfriend for a little over a year now, and we’ve been pretty happy together. Recently, she adopted a cat from a shelter, and while I initially wasn’t thrilled about it, I agreed to it because she was so excited. However, I’ve never really been a cat person, and I struggled to bond with the new pet.

A few weeks after she brought the cat home, I noticed that it was scratching up our furniture and knocking things over. I mentioned it to her, but she brushed it off and said it was just a phase. I got increasingly frustrated because I felt like I was the one who had to deal with the mess, especially since I was the one who paid for most of our furniture.

One day, after another incident where the cat knocked over a vase that I loved, I lost my temper. I told her that if she didn’t start taking better care of the cat and training it properly, I would take it to a shelter myself. I didn’t mean it seriously; I was just really upset in the moment. She started crying and said I was being cruel and that the cat was part of our family now. I felt bad for making her cry, but I still believed I was justified in being angry about the situation.

Since then, there’s been a lot of tension between us. I could tell she was really hurt by what I said, but I still think I was right to be frustrated. I just wanted her to understand how much the situation was bothering me. AITA?",258,877,0.53,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_88515,2021-10-16 00:00:00,YTA,1410,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I (29F) recently got married to my husband (30M), and we are in a good place financially. Before we got married, I had a close group of friends that I would travel with every summer. These trips were a big deal for us; we saved up all year and made some incredible memories together.

This year, I planned a trip to Europe with my friends, something we’ve been looking forward to for months. I told my husband about it, and he was supportive at first. However, things changed when he realized that the trip would overlap with his younger brother’s high school graduation. My husband expressed that it would mean a lot to him to have me there to support him and his family during this important occasion. He asked if I could skip the trip or at least come back early for the graduation. 

I told him that I had already committed to the trip with my friends and that I really didn’t want to miss out on it. I feel like I’ve sacrificed a lot in the past year to accommodate his family, including changing our wedding date to suit his mother’s schedule and missing events for his family. I told him it’s important for me to maintain my friendships and have my own experiences, and that he would understand once he thought about it. Besides, it’s just one graduation—he has his family there to support him.

My husband got upset and told me that it feels like I'm prioritizing my friends over him and his family. I feel bad, but I also think it's unfair for him to expect me to give up on something I’ve been looking forward to for so long. I told him that if he really wanted me there, he should have communicated that sooner, but I’m not going to cancel my plans now.

My partner has a close-knit relationship with her family, and they often share personal stories and jokes that sometimes poke fun at each other. During a recent holiday dinner, my partner's brother made a joke about how she used to be really clumsy as a kid, and she laughed it off. However, I felt it was a bit too harsh and embarrassing, especially in front of relatives I barely know.

After the dinner, I brought it up to my partner. I told her that I thought her brother's joke was inappropriate and that she should talk to him about it. She got upset and said it was all in good fun and that I was being overly sensitive. I pushed back, insisting that it’s important for her to stand up for herself when someone crosses a line. I ended up telling her that I expected her to speak to her brother about it, or I would do it myself.

Well, she didn't take that well. It escalated into a big argument where I accused her of not valuing my feelings and she accused me of being controlling. I felt justified in wanting her to defend herself, but now I’m starting to think I may have overstepped. She’s upset with me, saying I was trying to dictate how she interacts with her family and that I made her uncomfortable.

You're the Asshole,"My friend group has been planning a weekend getaway for months, and everyone was really excited about it. We booked a cabin in the woods and split the cost. There are six of us going, and we all agreed that it would be a chance to relax and enjoy nature. 

One of my friends, Sarah, is a vegetarian, and I knew that. I also knew that she has some food allergies, so I took it upon myself to plan the meals for the weekend. I thought it would be fun to cook for everyone, but I didn't consult anyone else about the menu. I decided to make a bunch of meat-heavy dishes because I figured, “Hey, it’s a cabin in the woods, we should have a barbecue!” 

When we got to the cabin, I started grilling burgers and sausages, and I didn't make anything vegetarian for Sarah. I just assumed she could eat the sides I prepared, like salads and grilled veggies. However, when Sarah saw the spread, she was visibly upset and told me she was really hoping for some vegetarian options or at least something she could eat. 

I brushed it off and told her that it was a group trip and everyone else was excited about the food I made. I even said, “You chose to be a vegetarian, so you should bring your own food if you can’t eat what we have.” That didn’t go over well, and the mood became awkward. 

The rest of the group ended up siding with Sarah, saying I should have considered her dietary needs since she couldn't eat most of what I made.

You're the Asshole,"So, context is key here so please read before passing judgment.

I (29M) have a younger sister, Emily (24), who recently got engaged. She's super excited about it, and I couldn't be happier for her. However, I found out that she wants to have a small wedding with just family and close friends due to her introverted nature. This is where things started to get complicated.

For some reason, I really dislike the idea of small weddings. I believe that weddings should be grand celebrations with all the bells and whistles. I feel like Emily is missing out on a once-in-a-lifetime experience by not inviting more people. In my mind, the more, the merrier! I also think it reflects poorly on her that she doesn't want to have a big wedding, almost as if she’s ashamed of her relationship or not proud enough to share it with everyone.

I decided to bring this up to her one evening when we were having dinner. I told her that I think she should reconsider her wedding plans and expand the guest list. I pointed out how amazing a larger wedding would be and how she would regret it later if she didn’t have all her friends there to celebrate. I even suggested some venues that are known for being beautiful and grand. 

Emily got really upset and told me that this was her wedding and her choice, and she just wanted it to be a personal and intimate event. I brushed her feelings aside, thinking she was just being overly sensitive. I insisted that I was just trying to help her make the best decision and that it would be better for her in the long run. 

Now, she hasn’t spoken to me much since that conversation, and I can't help but feel like I might have crossed a line. I still believe that I was just trying to encourage her to celebrate her love in a way that would be memorable, but looking back, maybe I should have respected her wishes more.

You're the Asshole,"I’m using a throwaway account for this because I don’t want my friends to know.

I’m a 22-year-old woman and I’ve been dating my boyfriend, Mark, for about four years. He’s super supportive and we get along really well. Recently, his best friend, Jake, who’s also 22, started dating a girl named Lisa. Lisa and I have known each other from college, but we weren’t close or anything.

A few weeks ago, during a casual get-together, I overheard Jake talking about how he was planning to propose to Lisa. I thought it was a sweet gesture, and I was really happy for them. However, after a couple of drinks, I jokingly said to Jake, “You better make sure you get it right, or else you’ll be the next one in the doghouse!” I laughed, but I could see he didn’t find it funny. He brushed it off, but I could tell it really bothered him.

Fast forward a week, and I was chatting with Mark. In a fit of excitement, I mentioned Jake’s proposal plans. I might have exaggerated a bit about how Jake was nervous about it because he didn’t want to screw it up. I thought it was harmless, just sharing some fun gossip. But then, Mark told me that Jake had actually confided in him about his proposal and expressed some serious doubts. 

A few days later, Jake ended up canceling his proposal entirely. Apparently, he was feeling pressured after hearing about my comments, and Lisa was really upset because she thought they were ready for that step. I found out later that Lisa had confronted Jake about it, and he ended up blaming me for putting doubts in his head.

Instead of apologizing or trying to clarify, I just brushed it off, thinking it was overblown. I figured I was just having fun, and Jake needed to toughen up. I didn’t think I was responsible for his actions, so I didn’t reach out to him.

Now, things feel really tense between our group. Lisa is upset with Jake, and Jake doesn’t want to hang out because he’s embarrassed and upset. Mark said I should reach out to Jake and apologize, but I don't really think it was a big deal. I was just joking around!

You're the Asshole,"TLDR: I have a coworker who constantly plays loud music at their desk, and it drives me crazy. I find it incredibly distracting and unprofessional. I’ve tried asking them to turn it down, but they just laugh it off. After multiple attempts to address it calmly, I started blasting my own music at an even higher volume to drown theirs out, and now everyone in the office is annoyed.

I work in a small office with about ten people, and my desk is located right next to a coworker who has a habit of playing music through their speakers at an obnoxiously loud volume. I’m all for enjoying music at work to boost morale, but the type of music they play is not something I can stand – it's all heavy bass and loud vocals, often early in the morning when it’s still quiet and I’m trying to focus on my tasks.

I’ve tried to be considerate and approach the situation diplomatically. I asked them nicely if they could turn it down a bit, explaining that it was hard for me to concentrate. They just laughed and said they enjoyed it too much to lower the volume. I thought maybe they didn’t realize how loud it was, so I tried again a couple of days later and suggested they use headphones instead, but that just led to more laughter.

Feeling frustrated, I went to our manager to see if they could help mediate this situation. Unfortunately, my manager said it’s not a big deal and suggested that I just deal with it or find a way to block it out. This really upset me because I felt like my concerns were being dismissed.

After trying to handle this calmly for weeks, I finally snapped. One day, I decided that if they were going to blast their music, I would blast mine even louder. I brought in a portable speaker and started playing my own playlist at max volume. I thought maybe this would get my coworker to see how annoying it was, but instead, it just turned into a battle of who could play music louder. Now the entire office is frustrated, and it’s become a chaotic mess of competing sounds.

I know I’ve probably made things worse for everyone, but I felt pushed to this point. Am I the asshole for escalating the situation instead of just finding a way to cope?

The night of the party, everything was going well. She was excited to see her friends and the astrologer was really engaging. However, as the readings started, I began to feel a bit out of place.

Last month, I was at a party hosted by a mutual friend. I was having a great time, mingling and catching up with people I hadn’t seen in a while. At one point, I noticed a girl, Sarah, sitting alone in a corner. I knew she was new to our friend group but hadn’t really spoken to her before. So, I thought it would be nice to go over and chat with her.

We started talking, and I quickly realized that we had a lot in common. We exchanged numbers, and I invited her to join our group for a game night we had planned for the following week. She seemed excited and grateful.

However, after the party, I began to feel a bit possessive about our budding friendship. I started texting her frequently, wanting updates on her life and making sure she was still planning to come to game night. I even asked her who else she was talking to in our friend group, which I now realize was overstepping.

When game night arrived, Sarah showed up, but she also brought along another friend from her college. This made me feel threatened and I ended up being really cold to Sarah throughout the night. I made snide comments about her friend, acting like she was trying to steal my new friend away from me.

After the game night, Sarah texted me saying she felt uncomfortable with how I treated her friend and that it seemed like I didn’t want her to have other friends. I was defensive and brushed off her concerns, saying she was overreacting. I told her she should just stick to our group instead.

In hindsight, I realize that I was being possessive and toxic, and it’s entirely possible that I drove her away. I really wanted to be friends with Sarah, but I ended up pushing her away with my jealousy.

After the trip, Lisa has been distant, and I reached out to her, but she hasn't responded much. My other friends have said I was harsh and that I should have been more understanding of her feelings on her birthday. I’m starting to think maybe I went too far.

You're the Asshole,"I (30M) have a close group of friends that I’ve known for over a decade. Recently, one of my friends, Jake (32M), started dating a woman named Sarah (28F) who has a young daughter, Mia (6F). Jake has been very serious about his relationship with Sarah and has taken on a fatherly role for Mia.

A couple of weeks ago, I hosted a game night at my place, and I invited Jake and Sarah along with a few other friends. I thought it would be fun for everyone to get to know each other better. However, during the game night, I noticed that Mia was a bit shy and not really participating. To lighten the mood, I jokingly said, “You know, Mia, if you don’t join in, we might just have to send you off to the other room with the boring adults!”

Everyone laughed, but Mia looked really upset. Sarah quickly pulled her aside and reassured her, but I could see that my comment hurt her feelings. I didn’t think it was a big deal at the time and brushed it off.

After the game night, Jake texted me saying that he didn’t appreciate my comment and that it wasn’t cool to make a joke at Mia’s expense. I got defensive and told him that I was just trying to be funny and that he was overreacting. I didn’t think it was a big deal because kids need to learn to take a joke, right?

Now I’m feeling conflicted. I don't want to lose my friendship with Jake, but I also think he’s being too sensitive about the whole situation. AITA for not apologizing and for thinking my comment was just a harmless joke?",299,1207,0.62,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_76586,2020-05-29 00:00:00,YTA,1488,AITA
You're the Asshole,"About six months ago, my daughter (12F) came home from school excited to share that she had made a new friend who is black. She described how nice this girl was and how much fun they had together during recess. I was happy for her and encouraged the friendship, thinking it was great that she was branching out and making diverse connections.

A few weeks later, I was speaking with some friends at a get-together, and the topic of race came up. I jokingly said something along the lines of, ""It’s funny how kids don't even notice race until we make a big deal out of it."" I thought I was making a light-hearted comment, but one of my friends, who has a mixed-race child, called me out, saying that my comment was dismissive of real issues surrounding race.

I felt embarrassed but tried to brush it off. Later, I told my daughter about my conversation, thinking it could be a teachable moment. I shared my joke, not realizing that it might hurt her friend’s feelings or make her feel uncomfortable about their friendship. She looked upset and said, ""Mom, you shouldn't joke about that. It's not funny.""

A few days later, I found out that my daughter had stopped hanging out with her friend. When I asked her why, she said she didn’t want to feel like her friendship was a joke or something I wouldn’t understand. I immediately confronted her about it, asking why she was overreacting and saying it was just a joke. I told her she should just lighten up and that it was silly to take it so seriously.

Now my daughter is upset with me and says she feels like I’m not supportive of her friendships. I’ve been trying to explain that I didn’t mean to offend anyone, but now I feel like I’ve driven a wedge between me and my daughter and impacted her new friendship because of my comments.

Recently, we decided to try a new Italian place that just opened up in town. Everybody was excited, and I was looking forward to trying their famous lasagna.

When it was my turn to choose the restaurant, I suggested the Italian place again since I was really craving it. However, one of my friends, Lisa, said she didn’t want to go there because she had a bad experience with the staff on her last visit. I could tell she was really upset about it, but I brushed it off and insisted we should still go. I told her she was overreacting and that it was just one experience. 

The others in our group were fine with my choice, and I felt frustrated that Lisa was being a downer about it. I ended up telling her that she was ruining the fun and that she should just get over it. I thought it was just a matter of her needing to lighten up. 

When we got to the restaurant, Lisa still had a sour attitude. She barely spoke to anyone and ended up ordering something she didn't even want, just to avoid the place. I tried to joke about it, but she just rolled her eyes. By the end of the night, I felt like I had to apologize to the group because the mood was so tense.

Sarah is really enthusiastic and always tries to help out when she can. She's been organizing team lunches and gatherings, which I think is nice, but I just don't really vibe with that kind of thing.

The issue started when she invited everyone to a team-building event after work. I have my own plans that I like to keep, and I'm not really into those kinds of activities. I told her I wouldn't be attending, and she seemed disappointed, which I thought was a bit over the top. I also made a comment about how I think it's unnecessary to waste time on ""team bonding"" when we could just be getting our work done.

After she sent out an email about the event, I responded with some snarky remarks about how it's just a way for the company to waste our time and that we should focus more on productivity instead. I thought it was all in good fun, but she didn't take it well. Now, she’s been avoiding me and even mentioned to a few coworkers that my comment was hurtful.

I genuinely don't understand why she's so sensitive about it. I mean, it’s just my opinion, right? I feel like I was just being honest and trying to save us all from a pointless evening. Now I'm starting to think maybe I crossed a line.

I’ve been working there for a while too, but I honestly thought the promotion was up for grabs since I’ve also been doing great work.

So, when I found out that my manager was going to be speaking to the higher-ups about the promotion, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I had heard that Jenna was going to pitch some of her ideas during the meeting, so I thought it would be a good idea to just casually present some of my own ideas as well. I ended up pulling together a presentation that highlighted my contributions and how I would approach the role differently than Jenna.

On the day of the meeting, I made sure to be there early, and when the manager asked if anyone had anything to add, I jumped in. I presented my ideas confidently, making it seem like I was the best candidate for the promotion. I could see Jenna’s face fall as she realized I was undermining her efforts.

After the meeting, Jenna confronted me. She was visibly upset and called me out for trying to steal her thunder. I told her that the promotion was competitive and that she shouldn’t have assumed it was hers just because she had been vocal about it. I argued that I had every right to present my case and that she should have been more prepared for competition.

Now, Jenna isn’t speaking to me, and the office is pretty tense. Some of our colleagues are on her side, saying I was out of line, while others think I was just being ambitious.

Recently, my husband has been spending more time with his sister, who is going through a tough time after her recent divorce. Initially, I was supportive, understanding that she needed family support, but it seems to have spiraled into something I didn’t expect.

My sister-in-law has started bringing her two kids over frequently, and my husband has been taking them out for fun activities without me or our daughter. He claims it’s a bonding experience for the kids and that it helps his sister cope. I feel increasingly left out and resentful, especially since I’ve noticed my daughter is becoming very attached to her cousins and prefers spending time with them over me.

Last week, my husband suggested having a family game night with his sister and her kids. I snapped and told him I didn’t want to participate in a “family” event that didn’t include just us three. I argued that we should be prioritizing our own family time, not accommodating his sister’s needs while neglecting our own. The argument escalated, and I ended up calling his sister a burden, which I deeply regret. 

I’ve been feeling jealous and insecure about how close they’ve all become while my husband seems to prioritize them over our own little family. I just wanted him to understand that I feel left out. Now he’s upset with me for disrespecting his sister and for not being more compassionate during her tough time.

You're the Asshole,"I am a college student and have been living with my roommate, Sarah, for the past year. We get along well most of the time, but we have differing views on cleanliness.

Sarah is quite tidy and likes to keep our shared spaces organized, while I tend to be more laid-back about things. I believe that as long as my personal space is clean, it's okay if the common areas are a bit messy. I don’t mind dishes sitting for a day or two or a few items on the counter, as I think it’s not a big deal and it’ll get cleaned up eventually.

Recently, Sarah has been getting increasingly frustrated with me about my messiness. I’ve noticed her cleaning things up when I’m not around, and she often leaves passive-aggressive notes on the fridge, like “Please clean up after yourself!” or “I spent my weekend cleaning, please don’t mess it up.” 

Last week, I had a couple of friends over for a small gathering, and we ended up making a bit of a mess. I figured I would clean it up the next day, but Sarah came home to find the living room and kitchen in disarray. She was visibly upset and told me I needed to be more considerate of our shared space. I brushed it off, saying that it was just a little mess and would be cleaned soon.

In my frustration, I told her that she was overreacting and that she needed to chill out. I also said that if she didn't want to live with someone who wasn't a neat freak, she should have picked a neater roommate. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I could see that my words hurt her.

Later that week, Sarah decided to have a chat with me about her feelings, which I thought was unnecessary. I told her that I was busy with school and that cleaning was not my top priority. I thought she should just accept that I have a different approach to living together.

Looking back, I realize I might have been dismissive of her feelings. I didn’t take her concerns seriously and instead made it about how she was the one with the problem.

There's this one friend, Sarah (27F), who has always been a bit of a downer on these trips. She tends to complain a lot about the activities we choose, and she often wants to do things that are more low-key, like going to a spa or just staying in and watching movies. We love her, but her energy can really bring the mood down when we're all excited about outdoor activities.

A few weeks before the trip, I suggested we all get together to plan the itinerary, but I made it clear that I wanted to stick to our usual outdoor adventures like hiking, kayaking, and bonfires. Most of my friends were on board with that, but Sarah started pushing for more relaxing options, mentioning things like yoga sessions and wine tastings.

I didn't want to ruin the trip for everyone, so I took it upon myself to create an itinerary that didn't include any of her suggestions. I thought if I just planned a weekend full of the things we all love, she would either join in or just opt out for the weekend.

When we finally got to the cabin, Sarah looked at the schedule and was really upset. She called me out for not including any of her ideas and said it felt like I was intentionally excluding her from the fun. I brushed it off and told her that we were there to enjoy what we all love and that she could join in or do her own thing.

So, I took it upon myself to call him and express my concerns. I told him that I thought it would be awkward for her to be there when we had so many family traditions that she might not understand.

My brother got upset and said that I was being controlling and that he wanted to share this part of his life with us. I didn’t understand why he was making such a big deal out of it. I just wanted to protect our family gathering and keep it special.

My friend came up to me and, in front of a few other guests, said, “Wow, I wish you had listened to me about the theme.” I felt embarrassed, but I laughed it off.

Throughout the night, I kept receiving comments from other guests about how my dress didn’t match the theme, and it made me increasingly uncomfortable. Instead of taking the hint, I decided to go up to the DJ and request a song that I really liked, even though I knew it wasn’t in line with the vibe of the wedding. I think it was a bit of an annoyance for everyone.

Eventually, my friend pulled me aside and told me that the night was about the theme and that I was ruining it for her. I was taken aback and felt like she was overreacting. I told her she was being too sensitive and that it was just one dress. I left the wedding early because I felt unwelcome.

Looking back, I realize that I should have respected my friend's wishes regarding the dress and the theme. I think my behavior was pretty selfish, and I should have considered how my choices affected her special day. So, AITA?",237,2805,0.55,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_11423,2023-09-01 00:00:00,YTA,1970,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I recently got into a heated discussion with my best friend, Jake, over something that I thought was just harmless banter. Jake has been dating his girlfriend, Mia, for about a year now, and she has a bit of a quirky fashion sense. It's not my style, but I’ve always said that as long as she’s happy, that’s what matters.

However, during a get-together with some friends, I jokingly made a comment about one of her outfits, referring to it as “a fashion disaster” and saying it looked like something out of a thrift store. Everyone laughed, including Jake at first, but then I noticed Mia’s expression change. She didn’t laugh; in fact, she looked hurt. I shrugged it off, thinking it was just a joke and that she’d get over it.

Later that night, Jake confronted me and told me I crossed a line. He said Mia puts a lot of thought into her outfits and my comment was really insensitive. I felt a bit taken aback because I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings—I just thought it was a funny joke. I told Jake that I was just trying to keep things light and that Mia should develop a thicker skin if she’s going to be in the public eye.

Since then, Mia has been distant with me, and I don’t think I should have to apologize for just sharing my opinion. I think I was being honest and funny. So now I’m wondering, am I the asshole for making a comment about Mia’s style? I think it was all in good fun.",867,2064,0.5,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_58409,2023-11-04 00:00:00,YTA,1396,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I’m a 29-year-old woman and I’ve been with my boyfriend, 30, for about three years. He’s a great guy, and we have a lot of fun together, but he has a tendency to be really controlling when it comes to my social life. He doesn't like it when I go out with my friends without him, and he often tries to discourage me from spending time with them unless he’s invited. I’ve had some arguments about this, but I’ve always tried to compromise and include him when I can.

Recently, my friends planned a weekend getaway for my birthday, and I was really excited about it. I told my boyfriend about it, and instead of being supportive, he got upset. He insisted that I shouldn’t go without him and that it wouldn’t be fun. I tried to explain that I wanted to spend this time with my friends and that I didn’t want to feel guilty for wanting to celebrate my birthday. 

In a moment of frustration, I texted my friends and said I would still go, but I didn’t mention that my boyfriend was upset about it. I figured it was my birthday, and I deserved to have fun. So, I went on the trip and had an amazing time, just like I hoped.

When I came back, my boyfriend was furious. He accused me of being selfish and not caring about his feelings. Instead of apologizing, I told him that it was my birthday and that I needed to prioritize my happiness. I thought he was being unreasonable and that I had every right to enjoy myself.

Now, I’m feeling guilty because he’s been really distant since I got back, and part of me thinks I might have overstepped by disregarding his feelings entirely. I just wanted to celebrate with my friends without him dampening my spirits.

I didn’t really like her much because she seemed to always be the center of attention, and honestly, I was jealous of how much my brother adored her.

During the Christmas dinner, while we were all sharing what we were thankful for, I made a joke about how Jake would probably propose to Emma soon. Everyone laughed, but I followed it up with, “Just make sure to get her a ring that’s not as cheap as her personality!"" I thought it was humorous, but the room went silent, and Emma looked hurt.

You're the Asshole,"Hi everyone! I need some perspective on a situation that happened recently. 

So, I have a really close friend, Sarah, who was going through a tough time. She was struggling with her mental health and had just lost her job. I had a good job and a stable income, so I felt it would be nice to treat her to a weekend getaway to help her unwind. I offered to take her to a cabin my family owns in the mountains, and I even paid for all the food and drinks for the trip.

However, I had a specific plan in mind. I wanted to take the opportunity to reconnect with her and maybe spark something romantic, as I’ve had a crush on her for a long time. So, I didn’t tell her about my feelings; I just focused on having a good time and being supportive.

During the trip, I noticed that Sarah started to feel a bit more herself again, but I also noticed she was being really friendly with some of the local guys at a bar we visited. I felt jealous, but I pushed that aside. On the last night, I decided to make a move and told her how I felt. To my surprise, she told me she just wanted to focus on herself and wasn’t interested in dating anyone, especially not me.

I felt humiliated and a bit angry, so when we got back home, I started telling mutual friends about how she rejected me and how I felt like I wasted my time and money on the trip. I might have exaggerated a bit about how she was flirting with those guys, and some friends told me I should have been more considerate about her feelings and not tried to make the trip about my own romantic feelings.

Now I’m feeling guilty because it seems like I turned a supportive gesture into a selfish one, and I might have hurt her feelings in the process. 

So, Reddit, AITA for trying to pursue my feelings during a trip I planned to help my friend?",870,1306,0.71,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_65724,2022-02-02 00:00:00,YTA,1795,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I (28 M) recently attended a wedding with my girlfriend (27 F). The wedding was for one of my close friends, and I was really looking forward to celebrating with everyone. However, as the day approached, my girlfriend brought up the idea of dressing up a bit more formally than I had planned. I was thinking of wearing a nice suit, but she suggested I wear a tuxedo to match her beautiful gown. 

I told her I didn’t really see the need for a tuxedo, especially since my friend is pretty laid-back and the overall vibe of the wedding was casual. I felt that a suit would be perfectly fine. Honestly, I didn't want to spend the extra money on renting a tuxedo when I already had a nice suit that I could wear. My girlfriend insisted that it would look better for photos and for the occasion, but I still stood my ground. 

As we argued about it, I started to get frustrated with her for trying to dictate what I should wear. I ended up telling her that she was being too dramatic and that it wasn’t a big deal. I even joked that she was just trying to turn the wedding into a fashion show. This really upset her, and she said I was being inconsiderate and not understanding how important this was to her. 

Despite her feelings, I refused to budge and ended up wearing my suit to the wedding. When we arrived, I noticed that many of the other guests were indeed dressed quite formally, and I felt a bit out of place. My girlfriend looked stunning in her gown, but I could see her disappointment when she realized I hadn’t made the effort to match her. 

Throughout the night, she was distant and I could tell she was upset. I tried to lighten the mood, but she was still frustrated with me. I ended up having a great time at the wedding, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I had ruined the evening for her.

As the night went on, my friend’s little brother (he’s 10) started getting really fidgety and wanted to play with the party decorations. He ended up accidentally knocking over a table with a cake on it, ruining it completely. Everyone was understandably upset, and I could tell my friend was really frustrated.

Instead of comforting my friend or helping clean up, I thought it would be funny to make a joke about how the cake looked like a “modern art masterpiece” now that it was on the floor. I even grabbed my phone to take a picture and posted it on social media with a caption, “When your cake has a meltdown.” 

My friend got really angry and told me to delete the post, saying it was disrespectful, especially since everyone was already upset about the cake. I laughed it off and said it was just a joke, and that people needed to lighten up. I refused to delete the post, insisting I was just trying to bring some humor to the situation.

He seemed upset, so I decided to poke fun at him to lighten the mood. I made a few jokes about him being boring and not having any fun, hoping to get him to laugh or at least engage with everyone.

Instead, he just sat there looking more uncomfortable. I thought he was just being overly sensitive, so I kept going, joking about how he should “get a personality” and how “nobody likes a Debbie Downer.” My other friends laughed, but then I noticed that Tom had left the room. 

Later, I found out that Tom was dealing with some personal issues and had been feeling really low for a while. A mutual friend told me that my jokes hit him hard and made him feel even worse. I felt bad, but part of me still thinks he needs to lighten up and that my jokes were all in good fun.

I made a nice dinner and set up the living room with her favorite snacks and a bunch of her go-to films. As we were watching a romantic comedy, I noticed she was really getting into the movie and started to laugh and smile more than she had in weeks. That made me feel good, and I wanted to keep that momentum going.

At one point, I jokingly nudged her and said something like, ""You know, if I were your boyfriend, I'd totally treat you better than that guy in the movie."" She laughed, but then I pushed it further and said, ""Honestly, I could totally see us dating. We have such a great vibe together."" 

I thought it would be funny, but she got really quiet and looked hurt. I quickly realized she was still reeling from her breakup, and my comments might have been inappropriate. I tried to backtrack and said I was just joking, but it felt awkward after that.

She left shortly after, and I received a text from her later saying that she appreciated my support but felt like I crossed a line. I thought I was just trying to lift her spirits and show her she deserves someone who treats her well. But now I'm wondering if I was out of line with my comments.

I had my laptop and was excited to spend a few hours working on my writing. As I was setting up, I noticed a woman at the table next to me with a small dog in her lap. It was a cute little thing, but I immediately thought about how some people can be allergic to dogs or simply not want to be around them.

I decided to speak up because I felt strongly that dogs shouldn’t be allowed in places where people eat or drink. So, I leaned over and said, ""Excuse me, but I don’t think dogs are allowed in here. It’s a health code thing, you know?""

She looked surprised and replied, ""It’s a service dog. She helps with my anxiety.""

I wasn’t buying it. I pointed out, “That dog doesn’t look like a service dog. Plus, it’s not even wearing a vest or anything.” I could see she was getting upset, but I continued, “You should probably take it outside, just to be safe.”

At this point, other customers were looking over, and the barista came by, sensing the tension. The barista asked if everything was okay, and I reiterated my concern about the dog. She politely told me that as long as the owner claims it’s a service dog, they are allowed to have it inside.

I felt vindicated, thinking I was protecting the space for everyone. But the woman ended up leaving, looking really upset, and I felt a bit guilty afterward.

Meanwhile, I’ve been working hard in my career and have managed to save up a good amount of money. I bought a nice house last year, and things are going well for me. I’ve always been supportive of my brother’s dreams, but I can’t help but feel frustrated sometimes.

Recently, our parents’ anniversary was coming up, and they asked us to pitch in for a nice gift. I suggested we split the cost evenly and find something special for them. My brother responded with a casual, “Sounds good, but I’ll need to check if I can afford my half this time.” 

I immediately felt annoyed. I work hard and have my finances in order, while he's still depending on our parents. So, I told him that since I’ve been doing well, I would cover the full cost of the gift this year, and he could just pitch in next year when he’s in a better place. 

He seemed really taken aback by my offer and said he felt bad about it. I tried to brush it off and said I was happy to do it, but I couldn’t help but think that he should be doing more considering he’s an adult now.

I suggested that she should find a better solution for childcare, like hiring a babysitter or asking a neighbor for help.

Sarah got visibly upset and said that she was doing her best and that I didn’t understand her situation. Instead of apologizing, I doubled down, telling her that if she couldn’t handle being a parent and working at the same time, maybe she shouldn’t bring her daughter to the office. I felt justified since I believed it was impacting everyone’s productivity.

Later, I found out that Sarah had a really tough week, and that bringing her daughter in was her last resort. I also learned that my comments had really hurt her feelings and affected her work. A few colleagues approached me and said that I was out of line, and that I should have been more understanding.

Now I’m feeling conflicted. I didn’t think I was being an asshole at the time, but maybe I was too harsh on her. AITA?",219,1465,0.66,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_80198,2021-08-21 00:00:00,YTA,1503,AITA
You're the Asshole,"AITA for not wanting to pay for my friend's birthday dinner?

Last week was my friend's birthday, and she decided to celebrate by going out to a nice restaurant. She texted our group and suggested that we all chip in to cover her meal since it was a special occasion. I was a little taken aback because I thought that when you celebrate your birthday, the birthday person usually doesn't have to pay for their own meal.

I told her that I wasn't comfortable with the idea of paying for her dinner, especially since I’m currently on a tight budget. I mentioned that I would be happy to join for the celebration but would prefer to split the bill among everyone, as we usually do. She got really upset and argued that since it was her birthday, it was customary for friends to pitch in for the celebrant's meal.

I tried to explain my perspective, saying that I had a lot of expenses right now and couldn't afford to cover her dinner. She said I was being selfish and that it wasn’t that much to ask from friends who supposedly cared about her. I felt like she was putting me on the spot and making me feel bad for not wanting to spend extra money.

When we got to the restaurant, I ordered something inexpensive to stick to my budget. She ordered a fancy meal and drinks, which ended up being a lot more than I anticipated. When the bill came, she again pushed for everyone to cover her meal, and I stood my ground. I only agreed to pay for my own portion.

Everyone at the table started to look uncomfortable, and I felt bad that my refusal was making the situation awkward. I could tell my friend was really disappointed, and it put a damper on her birthday celebration. Afterward, she said I was a terrible friend for not supporting her on her special day. 

Now I’m questioning whether I was wrong for not wanting to pay for her dinner. AITA?",105,2426,0.82,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_63747,2021-03-08 00:00:00,YTA,1845,AITA
You're the Asshole,"Alright, so here's my story. 

I have a younger cousin, let's call her Sophie, who is 13 and has been going through a tough time. She recently lost her mom, and it's been really hard on her and the whole family. I've always been somewhat close to her, so my parents suggested that I check in on her and help her out a bit during this difficult time. 

Initially, I was really supportive. I would text her every few days, check in on how she was feeling, and even invited her over for movie nights. But as time went on, I started feeling overwhelmed. I have my own life, school, friends, and responsibilities, and it felt like I was constantly walking on eggshells trying to say the right thing to help her feel better. 

One day, after she had a particularly emotional day at school and called me crying, I snapped. I told her that I was tired of being her emotional support and that she needed to talk to a therapist instead of relying on me all the time. I didn't mean to hurt her, but I was fed up with her constantly leaning on me for support when I was struggling with my own things too. I hung up on her, feeling justified in my frustration.

After that, I ignored her texts and calls for about two weeks. I figured she needed to learn to cope on her own and that my absence would force her to seek help elsewhere. Eventually, my family found out what happened and they were really upset with me. They said I was being cruel and that Sophie really needed family right now. 

So, AITA for telling my cousin to stop relying on me and ignoring her calls?",123,2310,0.64,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_42445,2021-12-29 00:00:00,YTA,1557,AITA

Recently, I started using a rewards credit card that gives me a lot of cash back on certain purchases. I’ve been using it to pay for our outings and accumulating quite a bit of cash back. The thing is, I realized that I could leverage this to get us some nice perks. For our last trip, I booked a weekend getaway to a popular destination and ended up getting around $100 in cash back from my credit card for the booking. 

Instead of splitting the total cost of the trip among us and sharing the cash back value, I decided to keep it all for myself since I was the one who booked it. I told my friends that the trip was going to cost them the same amount as it would have if I hadn’t used the card, and I pocketed the rewards. When they asked if I could break down the costs, I just told them it was easier to divide it evenly and that I didn’t want to deal with the hassle of calculating my cash back.

One of my friends, who’s usually pretty chill, called me out on it and said it felt unfair that I wasn’t sharing the rewards since they were essentially paying for part of it. I brushed it off and told her it was my card and my rewards, and they were still getting a good deal on the trip overall.

They’ve been together for about three years, and while they don’t live together yet, they've been talking about it. I’ve always thought Jake was a bit of a pushover when it comes to relationships, but he genuinely seems happy with Sarah.

Recently, I had a birthday party at my house, and I invited a few close friends and family. I mentioned it to Jake a month in advance and told him that Sarah was welcome to join us. However, the day before the party, Jake texted me to say that Sarah wouldn't be coming because she had plans with her friends instead. I was a bit disappointed but understood that it was her choice.

On the day of the party, I was having a great time with my friends, but I overheard a conversation where someone mentioned how much they liked Sarah and how they thought she was a great fit for Jake. In a moment of frustration, I made a joke about how Jake was probably better off without her since she didn't even want to come to his brother's birthday party.

It wasn't meant to be malicious, but it got a laugh from my friends, and I felt a bit validated in my opinion of their relationship. However, Jake overheard me and looked really upset. Later that night, he confronted me about what I said and told me I was being disrespectful to Sarah and to him. I shrugged it off and said it was just a joke and that he should lighten up.

So, my friend (let's call her Sarah, 26) and I (28) have been pretty close for a few years now. Recently, she got engaged and was planning her wedding. I was thrilled for her and offered to help out however I could, especially with planning and organizing.

However, things took a turn when she asked me to be her maid of honor. I was super excited and honored, but then she mentioned she wanted me to help with the wedding planning in a much larger capacity than I anticipated. I thought it was going to be just the usual maid of honor stuff, like planning the bachelorette party and holding her dress, but it turned into a lot of responsibilities—like finding venues, coordinating with vendors, and even managing the guest list.

I started feeling overwhelmed, and honestly, I didn’t want to deal with all of that. I had a busy work schedule, and I just wanted to enjoy the wedding without all the stress involved. So, I told Sarah that I wasn’t comfortable with the level of commitment she was expecting from me. I suggested she consider asking someone else who might be more available.

She was understandably upset. She said that I was abandoning her during such an important time and that she thought we were closer than that. I felt bad, but I just wanted to be honest about my limitations. Instead of being supportive, I ended up snapping at her and told her that she was being too dramatic about the whole thing.

After that, things got really tense. She ended up asking someone else to be her maid of honor, and I didn’t go to the engagement party out of spite. Now I feel like I might have ruined our friendship over a wedding, and I can’t shake the guilt. I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings, but I also didn’t want to overcommit myself.

The day of the party arrived, and Jake showed up in a tank top. While he looked good for the most part, I couldn’t help but notice that he had some belly rolls when he sat down. I thought it was really odd that he’d wear something so revealing, so I jokingly said, “Wow, Jake! That’s brave of you to show off the rolls!” 

He immediately became defensive and said he was proud of his progress, but I just laughed it off, thinking I was just teasing him like I always do. He left the party shortly after, and I found out later that he was really upset and hurt by my comment.

Recently, we decided to start planning a trip together to a tropical destination we’ve both wanted to visit for a while.

A few weeks ago, I mentioned that I wanted to stay in a nicer hotel for our vacation because, let's be honest, we work hard and deserve a little luxury. I suggested that we should save up and splurge on a beautiful beachfront resort. My girlfriend seemed a little hesitant and suggested we find a more budget-friendly option instead. I brushed it off, thinking she was just being practical.

When we started looking at hotels, I found this gorgeous resort with amazing amenities, but it was significantly more expensive than what she had in mind. I ended up booking it without really discussing it with her in detail. I figured it would be a nice surprise and that she would appreciate it once we got there.

A few days later, I told her about the hotel I booked, and she was not happy. She felt like I disregarded her feelings and input about the trip, and that I was being selfish for wanting to go somewhere so extravagant when we could have had a perfectly lovely time somewhere less expensive. I tried to justify my decision by saying we could make it work financially and that it was important for me to have a special experience together.

Now she's upset with me, and I don't understand why she can't just be excited about the trip. I thought it would be a nice gesture, but instead, it turned into a huge argument. I feel like I just wanted to do something nice for us, but now it feels like I've messed everything up.

One of the guests was my friend Sarah, who recently started dating a guy named Tom. They’ve only been together for a couple of months, but Sarah was really excited about him.

As the evening went on, Sarah was talking about how Tom is a “perfect gentleman” and how he always buys her flowers and takes her out to nice places. She also mentioned that he’s a bit shy and doesn’t have a lot of confidence. I thought this was sweet and was happy for her, until she started implying that she has to constantly reassure him of her feelings and that it’s exhausting.

Everyone went quiet, and Sarah looked hurt. I could tell I had crossed a line, but in my mind, I was just being honest. I thought she needed to hear it. After a few awkward moments, Sarah left, saying she needed some air, and Mark pulled me aside to tell me I was being an asshole. 

Looking back, I realize I could have expressed my thoughts in a much kinder way. Instead, I chose to insult her rather than support her in what should have been a happy moment.

You're the Asshole,"So, I had this roommate, Jake, who was really into cooking and trying out new recipes. He loved experimenting in the kitchen and often cooked dinner for us. I appreciated it, but I’m not really a fan of certain foods, especially anything with a lot of garlic or spicy stuff. 

Anyway, a few weeks ago, Jake decided to host a small dinner with some of our friends and asked if I could help him out. I agreed, thinking it would be fun. The day before the dinner, he asked me what I wanted to have, and I jokingly said, “Anything but garlic!” I thought it was clear I was just kidding, but he ended up making this amazing garlic-heavy pasta dish, knowing full well I wouldn’t enjoy it. 

When our friends arrived, I was trying to act casual, but the smell was overwhelming for me, and I couldn’t hide my discomfort. I ended up making a big deal about it, saying things like, “Why does it have to be so garlicky? Can’t you make something normal for once?” I could tell Jake was hurt, but I didn’t stop. I wanted to make sure everyone knew how much I disliked it.

After dinner, Jake pulled me aside and told me I had embarrassed him in front of our friends. I brushed it off, thinking it was just a joke, and that I was only being honest.

You're the Asshole,"I’m a 30-year-old woman, and I have a younger brother who’s 24 and is currently in a tough spot. He graduated last year but has been struggling to find a job in his field. He recently decided to pursue a passion for photography and wants to take a few months to travel around the country, capturing landscapes and working on his portfolio. He thinks this experience will help him grow as an artist and potentially lead to freelance work.

I completely understand wanting to follow your dreams, but I just feel like this is a huge waste of time. He’s already in a precarious situation, and I really think he should focus on finding a stable job instead. I told him that he’s not going to make any money just doing photography on the road, and that he’ll have to rely on our parents to support him while he’s off gallivanting around. 

When he brought up his plans to our parents, they were supportive and even offered to help him a little financially. I lost my cool and told him he should be more responsible and that it’s embarrassing to be living off our parents at his age. I even said that he should just get a steady job to pay off his loans first before going on some ""soul-searching adventure.""

I (30F) have a brother, ""Jake"" (28M), who has always been the golden child in our family. He was the star athlete in high school, graduated top of his class, and has a great job now. Meanwhile, I've struggled a lot in my career and personal life. I’ve always felt overshadowed by him, and, to be honest, I’ve harbored a lot of resentment over the years.

Recently, Jake got engaged to his long-time girlfriend, and they decided to have a small wedding. The whole family, including me, was invited, and I was happy for him. However, I couldn’t help but feel a bit left out during the planning. My parents were constantly talking about the wedding, making plans, and posting pictures of decorations on social media. Meanwhile, I felt like I was just a spectator in my own family.

In a moment of frustration, I ended up telling Jake that I thought he was being selfish for having such a big deal out of his wedding when I was still struggling to make ends meet. I brought up how the focus was always on him and how it felt like my achievements were never celebrated. I said that he was being inconsiderate of my feelings and that the family should spend more time supporting me instead of fawning over him.

Jake was understandably hurt and pointed out that this was his big day and that he wanted to celebrate it with the people he loved. He said I was being jealous and that it was unfair of me to bring my issues into his wedding plans. I felt bad, but I still believe he could have at least acknowledged my feelings instead of dismissing them outright.

During the party, I thought it would be funny to make a little joke about Emily’s obsession with wedding planning. I said something like, “At this rate, we’ll have more wedding planners than guests at your wedding!” I figured everyone would laugh, but instead, Emily looked really hurt. I didn’t think it was a big deal at the moment, so I kept joking and added, “Remember, it’s your wedding, not a Pinterest board!” 

The atmosphere changed, and I noticed Jake wasn’t laughing either. Emily eventually pulled me aside and told me that I was being too critical and should support her excitement instead of putting her down. I brushed it off, saying that I was just teasing, and everyone knows I’m supportive of her. 

Later that night, I overheard some guests talking about how my comments were inappropriate and that I should’ve considered Emily’s feelings. I started to feel a bit defensive since I thought it was just light-hearted fun. However, when I confronted Emily about it the next day, she told me I had embarrassed her and made her feel bad about something she loves. She also said I should apologize for my comments.

I didn’t think I did anything that warranted an apology, but I reluctantly sent her a message saying I was sorry if I hurt her feelings. I tried to explain that I was just trying to bring some humor to the situation. Emily responded by saying that she needed some space from me for a while because she couldn’t understand why I would make fun of her passion.

Now my parents are involved, and they think I owe Emily a real apology, not just a half-hearted one. I still feel like I was just joking, and everyone is overreacting.

You're the Asshole,"I recently went to a coffee shop that I love, and I was really looking forward to getting my usual order: a large caramel macchiato. When I got to the counter, I noticed a sign that said they had a new seasonal drink, a pumpkin spice latte, which was supposed to be really good. I thought about trying it, but in the end, I decided to stick with my usual.

I ordered the caramel macchiato, and when the barista asked if I wanted it hot or iced, I said hot. After she prepared my drink, I took a sip and realized it didn't taste quite right. I looked at the cup and saw that it had a mix-up with the order; they had made me the pumpkin spice latte instead.

I was annoyed and didn't want to pay for a drink I didn't order. I went back to the counter and told the barista about the mistake. Instead of being polite, I was really rude and demanded that they fix it immediately, raising my voice and making a scene. The barista was calm and apologetic, but I kept insisting that it was unacceptable for them to mix up orders, especially when I clearly said what I wanted.

Eventually, they made me a new caramel macchiato, but I was still in a bad mood. When it came time to tip, I left only a dollar on a $6 drink, even though I usually tip at least 20%. I felt justified because I thought they messed up my order, but looking back, I realize that I could have handled the situation better and that the barista didn’t deserve my rudeness or the poor tip.

A little background: My friend and I have been close since high school, and we share a lot of mutual friends. Recently, our group decided to have a weekend getaway to the beach, which we had all been looking forward to for months. A few days before the trip, my friend told me she was going to bring her new boyfriend, who I had never met. I was okay with it, but I was a little apprehensive because I didn't know how he would fit in with our group dynamics.

On the day of the trip, I saw that my friend posted a picture of her and her boyfriend on social media, and I quickly noticed that he had a very different vibe than the rest of our group. The moment we got to the beach and met up with everyone, I made a few snarky comments to my friend about her boyfriend, joking that he seemed out of place and not really “our type.” I was just trying to be funny, but I could see that my friend was uncomfortable. She laughed it off, but I could tell she didn’t appreciate it.

Later that night, things escalated when we were all hanging out around the bonfire. I kept making jokes about her boyfriend, and at one point, I told her that I didn’t think he was good enough for her. I thought I was just being playful, but it was clear that my friend was hurt. She ended up leaving the bonfire in tears, and the other friends were really upset with me for how I treated her.

I later reached out to apologize, but she told me she needed some space and that I had crossed a line. I honestly thought I was just being honest and giving my opinion as a friend, but now I realize I was rude and inconsiderate.

While I admire her dedication to her passion, I worry that her decisions are not practical.

Recently, she reached out to me because she was having a hard time financially. She had some bills piling up and was struggling to pay rent. Though I feel for her, I also believe that she needs to learn the consequences of her choices. I told her that I couldn’t just give her money to cover her mistakes. Instead, I suggested she look for a part-time job to help support herself while she continues to pursue her art on the side.

Instead of taking my advice, she got upset and accused me of not supporting her dreams. I couldn’t believe it! After all, I worked hard to build my own career and manage my finances, and I thought she should do the same. I ended up giving her a small loan, but I made it clear that I expected her to pay me back.

Now, she keeps asking me for more money, and I’m starting to feel resentful.

The only issue was that Jake had been really clear from the start that he didn’t want anyone else living with us, especially not someone who was emotionally vulnerable.

Despite knowing how Jake felt, I called Sarah and told her she could stay with us. I justified it by thinking that it would only be for a few weeks and that Jake would come around.

You're the Asshole,"I recently attended a wedding with my girlfriend, and it was a beautiful occasion. My girlfriend's family is quite large, and they were all excited to see each other again after a long time. During the reception, I noticed that my girlfriend's younger cousin, who is 12 years old, was feeling a bit left out as all the adults were busy catching up.

I thought it would be nice to include her, so I invited her to join me on the dance floor. We had a good time dancing, and she seemed to enjoy it. However, after a couple of songs, I noticed that her parents were watching us with concerned expressions. I tried to ignore it and kept dancing, but eventually, her dad came over and pulled her away from me, telling her that she shouldn't be dancing with someone much older than her.

I felt embarrassed and a bit offended. I mean, I was just trying to be friendly and include her in the fun. I told her dad that it was just harmless dancing and that it wasn't a big deal. He got really upset and said that I should respect their parenting choices and not overstep any boundaries.

Later, my girlfriend confronted me about it and said that I should have been more aware of the situation and the potential discomfort I was causing. I thought she was overreacting, but now I'm starting to wonder if I really did cross a line.

You're the Asshole,"I (32F) have a younger sister, Emily (25F), who just got engaged to her longtime boyfriend, Jake (26M). They are planning a big wedding for next summer and are really excited about it. 

I’ve always been a bit of a free spirit and have chosen to prioritize my career over starting a family. I’ve traveled a lot for work and don’t really have a stable partner at the moment. I’m happy with my life choices, but my family has always made comments about me being single and not having kids yet.

Recently, Emily asked me to be her maid of honor, which I was thrilled about. However, she also mentioned that she would like me to help cover some of the costs for the bachelorette party, which she plans to have in a different state. I was initially okay with this, but then she started throwing around some pretty extravagant ideas like renting a big house, hiring a private chef, and doing activities that would really add up.

When she shared her plans, I casually mentioned that I would prefer a more budget-friendly approach, maybe just a weekend getaway without all the frills. Emily got really upset and said I was being unsupportive and that I should be willing to invest in her special day. In a moment of frustration, I snapped and said that I didn’t think her wedding was a big deal since it’s just a piece of paper and that I didn’t see why I should have to spend so much money on it.

After saying that, Emily was really hurt and hasn’t spoken to me since. Our parents are now involved and are upset with me for my comment, saying it was disrespectful to her and her choices. I still think my point was valid, but I realize I might have crossed a line.

You're the Asshole,"Title: AITA for refusing to let my daughter attend her friend's birthday party?

So, I (40M) have a 15-year-old daughter, Lily. She's been invited to a birthday party for one of her close friends, Sarah, this weekend. Sarah's parents are known for throwing extravagant parties, and this one promises to be no different—with lots of games, food, and even a DJ.

Here's the thing: I've never really liked Sarah's parents. They seem overly indulgent and often let the kids do whatever they want without any boundaries. I’ve been aware that Sarah and her friends sometimes engage in behaviors that I find inappropriate for their age, such as underage drinking and sneaking out late at night during sleepovers. 

When Lily asked if she could go to the party, I immediately said no. I told her that I didn’t trust Sarah’s parents to supervise the kids properly and that I didn’t want her exposed to that kind of environment. I suggested that she invite a few friends over instead to hang out at our house, but she was really disappointed and argued that she should be allowed to make her own choices.

I know I might be overreacting, but I feel like I’m just trying to protect her. I told her that if she went to that party, she might get mixed up in things that could be harmful. I also mentioned that I don’t want her to be influenced by the kind of behavior I disapprove of.

Now, she’s upset with me and says I’m being controlling and unfair. I love my daughter and want what’s best for her, but I also don’t think I’m wrong for wanting to shield her from situations I deem dangerous.

I (28M) have a close friend, Mark (29M), who has been really struggling with his mental health for the past year. He’s been open about dealing with anxiety and depression, and I’ve tried to be supportive.

Recently, he started therapy and has been making some progress, which is great! However, I noticed that he seemed to be getting a bit too comfortable with his new coping mechanisms. He’s been spending a lot of time isolating himself and binge-watching shows instead of engaging with friends or finding healthier outlets. I get that we all handle things differently, but I felt like he was using this as an excuse to avoid real-life interactions, which I thought was counterproductive to his therapy.

So, during our last hangout, I decided to confront him about it. I bluntly told him that I thought he was just being lazy and that he needed to get his act together. I suggested that he might be using his mental health issues as a crutch to avoid taking responsibility for his life. I thought I was just being honest and that maybe it would motivate him to take action.

Mark got really upset and told me I was being insensitive and that I didn’t understand what he was going through. I thought he was overreacting, but he walked out of my place in tears. A mutual friend later told me I should have been more supportive instead of judgmental.

However, I have some concerns about Sarah's family. To put it bluntly, they can be pretty difficult to deal with. They have a reputation for being controlling, and I’ve seen them put a lot of pressure on Mark in the past.

When Mark invited me to the engagement party, I was excited but also a bit apprehensive about the family dynamics. I decided to voice my concerns to Mark, hoping to help him navigate what could be a tricky situation as he prepares for marriage.

I told him that I think Sarah’s family will try to manipulate him and that he should be cautious. I suggested he have a serious conversation with Sarah about boundaries and the importance of standing up to her family if they ever cross a line. Instead of appreciating my concern, Mark got defensive. He said that he loves Sarah and trusts her to handle her family, and he didn’t need my unsolicited advice.

Feeling frustrated, I pushed back. I told him that he was being naive and that it was critical for him to understand what he was getting into. I even said that if he didn’t want to listen to me, he might end up regretting it after they’re married. I also mentioned that if things got bad, he could always count on me to say ""I told you so."" Mark ended the conversation by telling me that I was being a jerk and that I should support him instead of trying to undermine his relationship.

A few days later, he decided to uninvite me from the engagement party, saying he needed friends who would support his happiness, not question it. I realize now that my intentions might have come off as controlling rather than caring, and I feel guilty for how I handled it.

They’re planning a wedding for next summer, and I couldn’t be happier for them. However, there’s been some tension about the wedding planning, particularly regarding the guest list.

Jake and Lily are on a tight budget and want to keep the wedding small with just close family and friends. They’ve asked me to help them with the planning, and I’ve been doing my best. But I’ve been a bit controlling about who should be invited. I suggested that they should exclude some of their relatives from Jake’s side who have been distant and not particularly supportive, while insisting that they invite my friends and some of my acquaintances.

The crux of the issue came when Jake told me that they wanted to invite a couple of Lily’s cousins whom I don’t get along with very well. I don’t think they should be there because I feel they’ve been rude to me in the past. So, I told Jake that if those cousins are invited, I might not attend the wedding at all. I realize it sounds dramatic, but I really don’t want to be in a situation where I have to see them.

Jake was upset and said it was unfair of me to make such threats, especially since this is their special day and they deserve to invite who they want.

However, a week before the wedding, I got a nasty cold. I was feeling pretty miserable and didn't want to risk getting anyone else sick, so I made the decision to stay home and not attend.

I texted my sister the day before the wedding, explaining my situation and apologizing for not being able to make it. She seemed really upset, which I totally understood, but I thought it was the right thing to do. I figured she would have enough people there to support her and enjoy the day.

Fast forward to the wedding day. My sister sent me a few pictures throughout the day, and I noticed how beautiful everything looked. I started feeling a bit bad about missing it, but I thought, “Well, at least I’m doing the responsible thing.” Later that evening, I posted a picture of my cold medicine and a box of tissues on social media, captioning it with something like, “The wedding I’m missing out on!” I intended it as a lighthearted joke, but it was definitely in poor taste.

To my surprise, my sister saw the post and was furious. She texted me saying that I was being insensitive and that I should have kept my personal jokes to myself. I didn’t think it was that big of a deal, but she ended up getting really upset and said I made her day about me instead of her.

You're the Asshole,"This happened a few weeks ago. I was at a family gathering for my cousin's birthday. During the party, my aunt brought a very expensive cake that she had specially ordered from a bakery. It looked amazing, and everyone was excited to try it. However, my cousin, the birthday boy, had a severe nut allergy, and my aunt made sure to keep him away from the cake.

As the party went on, I noticed that my aunt had placed the cake on a table in a corner, away from where the kids were playing. I thought it would be funny to sneak a piece of cake without anyone knowing. So, when no one was looking, I took a nice slice for myself and hid it in a napkin. I was planning to enjoy it later when I was alone.

A little while later, my cousin accidentally bumped into the table and the cake was knocked over. Everyone rushed over to see what happened, and my aunt was understandably upset. She started to clean up the mess, and I felt guilty that I had taken a piece earlier, knowing the cake was now ruined.

Instead of admitting what I did and offering to help clean up, I kept quiet and pretended to be surprised. I let my aunt take the blame for putting the cake in a precarious spot. I even joined in the complaints about how careless it was to leave such an expensive cake unattended, while inside I felt horrible.

You're the Asshole,"Last weekend, I hosted a small dinner party for some friends. It was meant to be a casual get-together with good food and conversation. I had invited a close group of friends, but one of them brought along their partner, whom I had never met before. I didn’t mind too much since we had plenty of space and food.

The evening started off nicely, but as the night went on, I noticed that my friend’s partner seemed to be sitting quietly in the corner, not engaging with anyone. I asked my friend about it, and they shrugged it off, saying their partner was shy. I decided to take it upon myself to include them and asked if they wanted to join us for a game we were playing. They politely declined, saying they weren’t really into games. So, I suggested they join us for some conversation instead, but they just smiled and said they were fine.

As the night continued, I noticed they were still just sitting there, not making any effort to join in. I began to feel frustrated. I thought about how I was putting in the effort to make everyone feel welcomed, and it felt unfair that this person was just content to remain isolated. So, I jokingly told them, “If you’re just going to sit there and not talk to anyone, you might as well go home.” 

The atmosphere shifted, and my friends looked uncomfortable. My friend’s partner got up and left without saying a word. Later, my friend confronted me about it and said I was rude for telling their partner to leave. I brushed it off, thinking that if they really wanted to join in, they should have made more of an effort. 

Now, I’m wondering if I overstepped by telling them they should just leave. AITA?",557,1887,0.83,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_80405,2020-03-13 00:00:00,YTA,1649,AITA
You're the Asshole,"So, I've been friends with this guy, Mark, for over a decade. We've had our ups and downs, but overall, I consider him one of my closest friends. Recently, Mark went through a really tough time; he lost his job and his girlfriend left him, which understandably devastated him. 

I wanted to help him out, so I invited him to stay with me for a couple of months while he gets back on his feet. At first, it was great; we hung out, played video games, and talked. But soon, I started to notice that he was becoming increasingly dependent on me. He would stay in his room all day, not applying for jobs or doing anything to help himself. 

One day, I got really frustrated with him. I was tired from work and wanted to relax, but he was just lying around, not making any effort. I snapped at him, telling him that he needed to get off his ass and find a job already. I mentioned that I was getting tired of being his babysitter and that it felt like I was supporting him instead of just helping him.

He took it really hard and ended up locking himself in his room for the rest of the night. The next day, he decided to leave. I felt kind of guilty, but I still think he needed that push. I told him I was just trying to motivate him and that he couldn't rely on me forever. 

Now, I’ve been reflecting on whether I was too harsh. I understand he’s going through a lot, but I thought I was just being honest.

You're the Asshole,"So, last weekend, my family planned a big barbecue at my house for my birthday. I was really excited because I hadn’t seen some of my relatives in a long time. I invited my aunt, who is vegan, but I made it clear that I wouldn’t be making any special vegan dishes because I wanted to focus on the meat and sides that everyone else would enjoy. She seemed fine with it and said she would bring her own food.

The day of the barbecue, I noticed that my aunt brought a ton of her special vegan dishes and set them up right in the middle of the table, overshadowing the meat dishes. I thought it was a bit rude, but I didn’t say anything. As the barbecue went on, I kept hearing her make comments about how unhealthy my food choices were, and how she couldn’t believe I would serve burgers and hot dogs for a birthday celebration.

I was getting really frustrated, especially since it was my birthday and I was the host. At one point, I jokingly said, “If you wanted a vegan party, you should have hosted it yourself,” trying to lighten the mood. But she took it personally and accused me of being inconsiderate. I snapped back and told her that it was my birthday and I could serve whatever I wanted.

Later in the evening, when most of my guests were enjoying the food, she pulled me aside and told me how disappointed she was in how I handled the barbecue. I rolled my eyes and told her she should have just eaten what she brought instead of criticizing my choices. 

Now, my family is divided. Some think I was right to stand my ground, while others feel I could have been more accommodating. I honestly just wanted to enjoy my birthday without her negativity.

Recently, one of my friends, Sarah (27F), got engaged. We were all super excited and planned a surprise engagement party for her. I was in charge of organizing the decorations and food since I love planning parties.

As part of the party, I wanted to make it really special and decided to create a slideshow with pictures of Sarah and her fiancé, Mike, throughout their relationship. I thought it would be a nice touch, but I also included a bunch of funny photos of Sarah from college, some of which were pretty embarrassing. I figured she would find them hilarious, and everyone else would too.

On the day of the party, Sarah loved the decorations and all of us were having a great time. When it came time to show the slideshow, I was really excited. As the photos played, I could see Sarah’s face go from happy to increasingly uncomfortable. I didn’t read the room at all and just kept thinking everyone was laughing and enjoying it. But Sarah eventually started to look really upset and even said, “Okay, can we stop?” in a really uncomfortable tone.

I didn’t stop immediately because I thought it was just one of those moments where she would eventually laugh it off. But she didn’t. After I finally ended the slideshow, Sarah pulled me aside and told me that I had crossed a line and embarrassed her in front of everyone. I felt terrible, but I also thought she was being overly sensitive. I insisted that everyone was having fun and it was all in good spirit.

Now, I feel guilty but also think that maybe she was just overreacting. So, AITA for thinking I didn’t do anything wrong and for showing those photos at her engagement party?",893,1901,0.5,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_39533,2019-04-03 00:00:00,YTA,1779,AITA
You're the Asshole,"Last weekend, my best friend invited me to her birthday party. She was throwing a big bash at a local venue and had planned a bunch of activities. I was really excited about it, but I have to admit that I can be a little selfish when it comes to my own preferences.

When I got to the party, I noticed that she had organized a karaoke session. I don’t particularly enjoy singing in front of others, so when it was my turn, I just sat down and pretended to be busy on my phone, scrolling through social media. Everyone else was having a blast, singing their hearts out, but I just couldn't get myself to join in.

Later in the evening, my friend came over to me, clearly upset. She said, “I wish you would participate instead of hiding away. This is supposed to be a fun night!” I rolled my eyes and told her, “Not everyone likes karaoke, you know. Just because you do doesn’t mean I have to.”

She tried to explain how much it meant to her to have everyone involved, but I just brushed her off. I told her that she should have picked a theme that everyone could enjoy. After a bit of back-and-forth, I snapped and said, “It’s your party, not mine. If you want me to sing, then maybe you should have thought of something better!”

The atmosphere shifted, and I could see my friend was hurt. I felt a little guilty but convinced myself that it was her fault for planning something I didn’t like. As the night went on, I continued to isolate myself, sitting at a table with a few other friends who were also uninterested in karaoke.

By the end of the night, my friend was visibly disappointed, and I ended up leaving early.

I confronted J about the party and he shrugged it off, saying it was just for fun and that it wasn’t a big deal.

In a moment of anger, I decided to take drastic action. I went to J’s room and found his gaming console. It was one of the most expensive things we had bought for him. I took it outside, set it on the ground, and smashed it with a hammer. I wanted him to understand the consequences of his actions. I recorded the whole thing on my phone and posted it on social media with the caption “Tough Love in Parenting.”

J was devastated and started to cry, saying I had gone too far. I told him that this was a lesson he needed to learn.

I mentioned my financial situation to Jake, hoping he might understand. Instead, he insisted that I find a way to get a tuxedo, saying that it’s an important day for him and that all the groomsmen need to match. I felt really pressured and upset because I didn't want to let him down, but I also didn't want to go into debt over this. 

After some back and forth, I decided to just back out of being a groomsman altogether. I told Jake that I wouldn’t be able to make it to the wedding at all, thinking that it would make him realize how serious my financial situation was. Instead of being understanding, he was really hurt and called me selfish. He said that I was making it all about me and not considering how much it means to him to have me there as part of the wedding party.

I was feeling kind of left out since I dropped out of college a few years ago to pursue a different career path, and I couldn’t help but feel a bit bitter.

As she was speaking, I interrupted her and said something like, “Well, I hope you enjoy your degree while you can. It won’t guarantee you success. Look at me, I’m doing just fine without a degree.” I chuckled a little, thinking it would lighten the mood, but the room fell silent, and my sister looked really hurt.

When we arrived, the atmosphere seemed fun at first, but as the night went on, I noticed Sarah constantly steering the conversation back to herself and her interests. 

At one point, she started talking about her recent promotion, and I simply commented, “That’s great, but I thought the company was struggling? How do you feel about that?” It was meant to be a light-hearted jab, but she took it very seriously and got defensive. Instead of letting it go, I continued to poke fun at her over the course of the evening, making snide remarks about her self-absorption. 

Jake eventually pulled me aside and told me to cut it out, but I felt justified in what I was saying. I told him I was just being honest and that I wanted to make sure he knew what he was getting into with her. After dinner, Sarah was clearly upset, and Jake was frustrated with me.

You see, my boyfriend is a huge fan of gaming and has a dedicated gaming room filled with expensive equipment. He spends a lot of time in there, and I’m supportive of his hobby.

However, I’ve been feeling a bit neglected lately, as he prioritizes gaming over spending time with me. I’ve tried to communicate this to him, but he always brushes it off, saying he needs some time to unwind after work. I understand that, but I also feel like we need to make time for each other.

When he came home and saw what I did, he was furious. He yelled at me for going into his personal space without asking and for messing with his gaming setup. He said I had no right to change anything in a room that he had put so much effort and money into. I tried to explain that I just wanted to make it a more welcoming space for us to enjoy together, but he didn’t see it that way.

It was exhausting, so I started to just make her grilled cheese sandwiches and pasta every night because I knew she'd eat them.

One day, I made my husband and me burgers for dinner, and I decided to just let Anna have another grilled cheese. Meanwhile, I had some extra burger patties that I didn't want to waste, so I crumbled one into her pasta, thinking she wouldn’t notice. When she saw it, she was upset and said, “Mom, I told you I wanted to be vegetarian!” I shrugged it off and told her it was just a little bit of meat and didn’t matter. 

After that, she was really upset with me and said she didn’t want to eat my food anymore. I thought she was being dramatic, so I just kept doing my thing and made her grilled cheese every night. It seems like she just kept getting more and more frustrated, but I didn’t think it was that big of a deal since she was eating pasta, cheese, and veggies.

A couple of weeks later, I found out that she had been sneaking snacks from the pantry like chicken nuggets when she thought I wasn’t looking. When I confronted her about it, she said she was tired of only having cheese and pasta and wanted to enjoy some of her favorite foods. I told her she should just eat what I make because I didn’t want to make extra meals for her.

I realized I might be the asshole here, but honestly, I just didn’t think it was that serious. I thought she’d get over it and eat what I cooked.

You're the Asshole,"I (26F) recently got engaged to my fiancé (28M), and I couldn't be happier. However, there’s a situation that’s been bothering me, and I’m starting to wonder if I’m the one at fault.

My fiancé and I have been together for about four years. He has a close-knit group of friends, and they all hang out together regularly. Recently, I found out that my fiancé and his friends have a tradition where they go on a ""guys' trip"" every year. This year, they invited me to join them, which I thought was nice. But then I learned that they planned the trip for the same weekend as my best friend’s wedding, which I’m supposed to be a bridesmaid in.

I told my fiancé about the conflict, and instead of suggesting a different weekend, he insisted that I come along. He said it would be a great way to bond with his friends, and that I should just tell my friend I can’t make it. I felt hurt and upset, especially since I’ve been looking forward to this wedding for months. I tried to explain how important it is for me to be there for my friend on her big day, but he brushed it off, saying I could just hang out with my friend later.

After a few back-and-forths, I ultimately decided to choose my friend’s wedding over the guys' trip. I figured it was the right thing to do. When I told my fiancé, he was visibly upset. He accused me of not valuing his friendships or our relationship. I felt guilty but also stood by my decision, believing that supporting my friend was important.

Now, I’m starting to wonder if I handled this poorly. Maybe I should have just gone with him and then explained my situation differently. Was I wrong to prioritize my friend’s wedding over his trip?

You're the Asshole,"I (26M) recently moved into a new apartment complex and was excited to meet my neighbors. One of my neighbors, Sarah (30F), is a single mother with a young child. I often saw her struggling with groceries and managing her child, so I thought it would be nice to help her out. 

A few weeks ago, I offered to help her carry her groceries up to her apartment. She was really appreciative and thanked me. After that, I started to feel like I was entitled to some sort of friendship or acknowledgment for my help. I began to drop by her apartment unannounced, thinking that I was being friendly and supportive.

One day, I knocked on her door while she was clearly busy with her child and a home project. I barged in without waiting for her to answer, thinking it would be a nice surprise. She looked overwhelmed and asked me to leave. I persisted, saying that I just wanted to hang out and help her with whatever she was working on.

Sarah got frustrated and told me that she needed her space and didn’t appreciate me coming over without an invitation. I got defensive and told her that since I was helping her, she should be grateful for my company. I added that I was just trying to be a good neighbor and I didn’t understand why she was being so rude.

Since then, she’s been distant, and I saw her speaking to the management about my behavior. I feel like I was just trying to be friendly and help, so I don’t think I did anything wrong.

You're the Asshole,"So, I've been dating my girlfriend for about a year now, and things have been going pretty well overall. She has a 9-year-old son from a previous relationship, and while I knew he would be part of the package, I didn't expect to feel the way I do about him. At first, I was really excited to bond with him, but over time, I've found myself increasingly annoyed by his presence.

He’s a pretty active kid, always running around, making noise, and asking a million questions. I work long hours, and when I come home, the last thing I want to deal with is a hyperactive child. I’ve tried to be patient, but I often snap at him when he interrupts my downtime or tries to engage me in games. Just last week, he wanted to play a board game with me, but I was exhausted and told him to go away because I didn’t feel like playing with a “little kid.”

My girlfriend has expressed that she wants us to be a family and that spending time with her son is important for our relationship. I get it, but I can’t help feeling that I shouldn't have to entertain him all the time. I’ve even suggested that she take him to the park more often or spend one-on-one time with him so I can have some peace. She said she understands I need my space, but I could sense her disappointment.

This past weekend, she planned a family game night, and I rolled my eyes when she brought it up. I told her I wasn't interested and that I’d rather do something else, like watch a movie by myself. She was upset and said I was being unfair to both her and her son, but I don’t really see what the big deal is. I feel like I should be able to prioritize my own needs without feeling guilty.

Last month, we were all at his house for a family dinner, and his daughter was feeling shy and withdrawn. She wasn't engaging with anyone and seemed really bored. I thought it would be fun to lighten the mood, so I decided to do a silly dance in the living room to one of her favorite songs. I thought it would make her laugh.

Unfortunately, instead of laughing, she looked really uncomfortable and even asked me to stop. I didn't listen; I just kept dancing, thinking that I was doing something fun and playful. My partner finally stepped in and told me to stop and that his daughter didn't like it. I felt embarrassed, but I thought I was just trying to be funny.

Afterwards, my partner and I had a huge argument about it. He felt I was disrespectful and didn't consider his daughter's feelings. I argued that I was just trying to have fun and that kids need to learn to lighten up. I thought I was being a cool step-parent, but now I realize I was being insensitive. 

I’ve apologized to my partner, but I still don’t see why my actions were such a big deal.

You're the Asshole,"So, I (25F) have a best friend named Sarah (26F) who has been in a serious relationship with her boyfriend, Jake (27M), for about four years. They seem really happy together, and I’ve always supported their relationship. However, I recently learned that Jake was planning to propose to Sarah soon, which is exciting news for them!

Here’s where I messed up. About a month ago, I was hanging out with Jake and some mutual friends. After a few drinks, I jokingly made a comment about how I couldn't wait for him to put a ring on Sarah's finger. It was meant to be light-hearted, but Jake looked really uncomfortable. I brushed it off and laughed, thinking he was just shy about public proposals or something.

A couple of weeks later, I found out from another friend that Jake had actually been planning a surprise proposal and my comment had completely thrown him off. Apparently, he was really stressed about it because he wanted it to be perfect, and my joke made him feel like he couldn’t pull it off anymore. 

I felt awful when I heard this. I texted Jake to apologize, but he didn’t respond, which made me worry that I might have ruined things for him and Sarah. I decided to reach out to Sarah and tell her what happened, thinking she might want to talk it out with Jake. I figured it would help ease the tension.

Sarah was furious with me. She said I was being selfish and didn’t respect their relationship. She told me that I had put her in an awkward position and that it would have been better if I had just kept my mouth shut. I tried to explain that I didn’t mean any harm and that I was just joking, but she said I was being insensitive.

Now, I feel like I might have overstepped by informing Sarah about Jake’s proposal plans and that my comment ruined the surprise. I didn’t intend to cause any drama; I just wanted to be supportive. But now, I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for even mentioning it to Sarah.

You're the Asshole,"So, I’ve been growing increasingly frustrated with my friend group lately, and I need to share what happened and see if I’m in the wrong. 

I’m in my late twenties, and my friends and I have been close since college. We’ve always had a pretty tight-knit group, and we made a pact to always support each other’s dreams. Recently, one of my friends, Sarah, decided she wanted to pursue a career in music. She's been working really hard and has even started performing at local bars. I think it’s great that she’s following her passion, but honestly, I find her music pretty mediocre, and I don't really enjoy it.

Last week, she invited all of us to her first big gig at a well-known venue, and I was planning on attending, but I was dreading it. I thought it would be a long night listening to something I didn't like. So, the day before the show, I jokingly told her, ""I’ll come if you promise to get better at singing!"" I thought it would lighten the mood, but she looked really hurt and said I was being unsupportive. I brushed it off, thinking she was being overly sensitive.

When the night of the gig arrived, I went, but I couldn’t help but groan internally during her set. I ended up texting a couple of friends throughout the performance, making some sarcastic comments about her singing. I thought it was harmless fun, but I guess I didn’t realize how loud I was being. After the show, Sarah confronted me and said I embarrassed her in front of her friends and that I was supposed to be supporting her, not tearing her down. 

Now, some of my other friends are saying I was out of line, but I feel like I was just being honest in a lighthearted way. I mean, it’s not my fault she doesn’t have the talent to back up her ambition, right? A few of them think I should apologize, but I’m not sure I did anything wrong. 

So, am I the asshole for not holding back my opinion and for not being more supportive?",510,2832,0.99,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_45373,2021-01-17 00:00:00,YTA,1913,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I need to share something that’s been weighing on my mind. A few weeks ago, my best friend had a pretty significant life event—a wedding. I was super excited for her and had been helping her plan everything for months. However, when the big day arrived, I had a minor medical procedure scheduled just a couple of days prior, and while I thought I’d be okay, I ended up feeling quite unwell on the wedding day.

Instead of going to the wedding, I decided to stay home and rest. I figured my friend would understand since I was technically still recovering. That evening, I saw that my other friends were posting pictures from the wedding on social media, and I felt a wave of jealousy wash over me. I felt like I was missing out on something huge and began to scroll through the posts, getting more and more upset.

In my frustration, I decided to vent to my friend in a group chat, saying things like “I can’t believe I’m missing the best day of your life” and “I’m so bummed; I wish I was there.” I was trying to express my disappointment, but I think it came off as making it about me instead of celebrating her big day. My friend replied, thanking me for my support leading up to the wedding, but she seemed a bit put off by my messages.

The next day, she sent me a message saying she was hurt by my comments and felt it overshadowed her special day. I didn’t mean to make her feel that way, and it made me realize I was being selfish by focusing on my feelings instead of hers. I apologized, but I still feel guilty about it.

You're the Asshole,"Throwaway account.

For context, I (28F) have a younger brother, Jake (20M), who has always been a free spirit. He recently decided to quit his job and pursue his dream of becoming a professional musician, which I respect, but I also worry about his financial stability. Our parents have been very supportive, but they aren’t financially well-off, so they can’t help him out much.

Jake has been living off his savings, and to save money, he’s been couch surfing between friends. This has become a bit of a problem because he frequently stays at my place, but I’ve noticed he’s become very careless about cleaning up after himself. I’m a tidy person, and I like to keep my apartment organized, so it’s frustrating to see dirty dishes piling up and clothes strewn around when he visits.

Recently, he left a bunch of his dirty laundry in my living room for over a week. I finally had enough and decided to take matters into my own hands. I gathered all his dirty clothes and put them in a garbage bag, planning to take them to a laundromat for him. I didn’t want to confront him about it because I thought he’d just get defensive and dismiss my feelings.

When he came over next, I handed him the bag and told him I was helping him out because it was getting out of control. He got really upset and accused me of being controlling and judgmental, saying that it’s his life and his mess to deal with. I thought I was doing the right thing by stepping in to help him, but now I’m questioning whether I overstepped my boundaries.

WIBTA for putting his dirty laundry in a bag and giving it to him?

Edit: After reading through the comments, I can see that I probably should have just talked to him about my feelings instead of acting like I did. I’ve apologized to Jake, and we’re going to chat about boundaries in a better way moving forward.

Instead of just telling him no, I decided to take it a step further. I sent him a long message outlining all the reasons why pursuing music is a bad idea and how he should consider going for a more traditional job, like accounting or engineering.

There’s this coworker, Mike, who has been working there for a long time, but he didn’t get the promotion when I did. He’s a nice guy, but I could tell he was a bit bitter about it.

One day, we had a team meeting, and I noticed Mike was unusually quiet. I thought maybe he was just having a rough day, so I decided to lighten the mood a bit. During the meeting, I made a joke about how I’d need to keep an eye on him since I was now his boss. It was meant to be fun, but I could see that Mike didn’t take it well. He was visibly upset, and I didn’t think much of it at the time.

Later that day, I overheard Mike talking to another coworker, and he mentioned how he felt disrespected by my joke. I brushed it off because I thought he was overreacting. I mean, it was just a joke, right? I didn’t want to apologize because I felt that would make me seem weak or like I was taking his feelings too seriously.

A couple of weeks later, during another meeting, I made another joke at Mike's expense, thinking it would be funny to keep the lighthearted vibe going. This time, he snapped and told me to stop making jokes about him. Instead of backing down, I laughed and said, “C’mon, Mike, it’s all in good fun! You need to lighten up.” 

Fast forward a few days, I found out that Mike had talked to our manager about how my jokes were making him uncomfortable. My manager called me in for a chat and told me I needed to be more considerate of my team members’ feelings. I felt embarrassed, but I still didn’t think I did anything wrong.

My girlfriend and I have been together for a couple of years, and she has a younger brother, Jake, who is 10. He’s a sweet kid, but he’s been going through a bit of a rough patch at school and has been shy about expressing himself.

Recently, my girlfriend and I were discussing how to help Jake feel more confident. She suggested that we take him out for a fun day, maybe to a trampoline park or an arcade where he could let loose. I was all for it because I think he needs some encouragement to break out of his shell.

However, I took it a step further and jokingly suggested that we could also get him a makeover at a local salon, where he could pick out some cool hairstyles and maybe even try out some nail polish. I thought it would be funny and might give him a confidence boost since he’s expressed interest in trying things outside of the typical “boy” stuff.

I love cooking and wanted to make it special, so I planned a nice menu with a few courses, including appetizers, a main dish, and dessert. I invited six friends, including my buddy Jake and his girlfriend, Lisa.

Now, Lisa has some dietary restrictions. She’s vegan and gluten-free, which I knew when I invited them. I thought I could accommodate her by making a large salad and a vegan gluten-free pasta dish. However, I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it, so I didn’t reach out to her for more specific preferences. I figured a salad and pasta would be enough.

The day before the party, I spent the whole day preparing and cooking everything, and I was proud of the spread I put together. When everyone arrived, we started with some appetizers, and everyone seemed to enjoy the food. However, when we got to the main course, Lisa took one look at the pasta and said, “Is there any chance this is gluten-free?” I assured her it was, but she still looked confused. It turns out, I had accidentally used regular pasta instead of gluten-free pasta because I didn’t double-check the packaging.

I apologized profusely and offered her the salad, but she didn’t seem satisfied. Jake tried to reassure her, saying it was okay, but I could tell she was upset. After dinner, I suggested we order some vegan gluten-free pizza for her, but Lisa declined, saying she didn’t want to impose.

The dinner party ended on a somewhat awkward note, and I felt terrible. A few days later, I mentioned to some friends how I felt bad about not accommodating Lisa properly.

A few weeks later, I was over at her place, and I noticed that one of my books was damaged. I was furious. I confronted Jess about it, and she apologized, but I could tell she didn’t really understand why I was so upset. I ended up demanding that she buy me a brand-new copy and return the others immediately, even though I know she can’t afford it. 

Now, I realize that I might have overreacted a bit, and I feel terrible for how I handled the situation. I made her feel awful for a small accident and didn’t consider her feelings or financial situation. I just wanted my things back and didn't care about how my outburst affected our friendship.

My best friend, Jake (28M), recently started dating someone new, and I just don’t think she’s right for him. I’ve known Jake for years, and I feel like I have a good sense of what’s best for him. He seems really happy, but I can’t shake the feeling that she’s just using him for his connections and that she’s not really into him. 

So, the other night, we were hanging out, and I couldn’t help myself. I started off casually, saying things like, “Have you noticed how much she talks about herself?” and “Doesn’t it bother you that she never asks about your interests?” I thought I was being a good friend by pointing out red flags. 

Jake got defensive and told me that he appreciated my concern, but he really liked her and wanted me to be supportive. I responded with, “I can’t just sit back and let you make a mistake. I care about you too much for that.” 

Looking back, I realize that I kept pushing and pushing, and my comments became more intense. I even told him that if he kept dating her, I would have a hard time hanging out with them together. That was pretty harsh, and he ended up leaving, clearly upset. 

Now, I feel like I might have been an asshole for not respecting his choices and for trying to control who he dates. I thought I was looking out for him, but maybe I just made things worse. Am I the asshole here?",84,989,0.58,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_12573,2021-10-10 00:00:00,YTA,1571,AITA

However, one of my friends, Sarah, just got back from a different beach trip, and she was really looking forward to showing us her pictures too. But when she started talking about her trip, I felt a little jealous and wanted to shift the attention back to myself. So, without really thinking it through, I interrupted her and said, ""Well, my trip was way better! You should see my pictures; they’re amazing!""

I then proceeded to pull out my phone and started scrolling through my pictures, barely letting Sarah finish her stories. I could tell that she was getting a bit annoyed, but I was so caught up in sharing my experience that I didn’t really notice or care. I kept making comparisons, saying things like, ""Oh, but we had better weather,"" or ""My beach was way cleaner than yours.""

After a while, Sarah just sighed and looked really frustrated. A couple of other friends chimed in, trying to be supportive of her, but I brushed them off and kept going on about my trip. Eventually, Sarah just left the conversation, and I could tell I had ruined the mood.

Later, a mutual friend reached out to me and said that I was being kind of a jerk and that I should have let Sarah share her experience without trying to overshadow her. I got defensive and told them I was just excited about my trip and didn’t mean to hurt anyone’s feelings.

My girlfriend and I have been together for about two years, and we generally have a good relationship. We both have our own friends and social circles, but we also enjoy spending time with each other's friends. Recently, my girlfriend reconnected with her childhood friend, J, whom she hadn’t seen in a long time. They hit it off again and started hanging out more, which I was initially fine with.

Last week, J invited my girlfriend to a concert, and I encouraged her to go since she was excited about it. I had plans that night, so I couldn’t join her. However, I found out that after the concert, they went back to J's place to hang out and drink a little. When she told me this, I felt a wave of jealousy. I don't really know J that well, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was inappropriate for her to be alone with him in that situation.

When she got home, I confronted her about it. I expressed my discomfort and told her that I thought it was disrespectful to our relationship. I said she should have considered how I would feel about two friends of the opposite sex being alone together, especially after a concert where they had been drinking. She got upset and told me she had every right to spend time with her friends and that I needed to trust her.

I tried to explain that I wasn’t trying to control her, but I felt it was just not right for her to put herself in that position. I suggested that she should be more considerate of my feelings and maybe think twice about hanging out with J alone in the future. She said I was being controlling and that I should trust her judgment.

You're the Asshole,"I know this might sound harsh, but I really need to get this off my chest.

I’ve always been the type of person who believes in tough love. I have a younger sister, Sarah, who’s 21 and still figuring things out. She's been struggling with her career and finances, and I've been trying to help her out. However, I’ve noticed that she often makes poor decisions, like spending money on things she can’t afford and relying on credit cards excessively.

Recently, she told me she was thinking about moving in with her boyfriend, who I believe is just using her for financial stability. He doesn’t have a solid job and seems to be taking advantage of her savings. I voiced my concerns, but she shrugged them off, insisting that they were in love and she could manage. 

Frustrated, I decided to take a more drastic approach. I told her that I wouldn’t be able to help her financially after the end of the year if she went through with the move. I felt that this was a necessary step to make her realize the reality of her situation. My thinking was that if she was put in a position where she had to fend for herself, she might finally wake up and start making better choices.

When I brought this up, Sarah was understandably upset. She accused me of being controlling and not believing in her ability to make her own decisions. I insisted that I was just trying to prepare her for the real world. My friends and family think I was too harsh, but I believe it’s a wake-up call she needs.

So, here's the situation. I’ve been really into this new hobby of baking bread during the pandemic, and I’ve gotten pretty good at it. I love sharing my creations with family and friends, and I tend to bake a lot. A few weeks ago, I decided to bake a batch of sourdough and ended up with a loaf that I thought was really impressive. I was so proud of it that I decided to take it to a family gathering.

When I arrived, I placed the loaf on the table alongside the other food. My family was excited, and we all sat down to eat. However, as everyone started serving themselves, I noticed that my aunt, who has a gluten intolerance, was eyeing my bread. She asked if it contained gluten, and I confidently told her that I had made it from scratch and used regular flour, but I didn’t think it would be a big deal because ""everyone needs to have fun, right?""

Well, my aunt ended up trying a small piece despite her intolerance. She immediately had a reaction, and it was really uncomfortable to watch. Everyone rushed to help her, and I felt awful. I thought I was just sharing my passion, but I completely disregarded her health and well-being. After the incident, I tried to apologize, but my family was understandably upset with me.

Now, I can’t help but feel guilty. Was I wrong to bring my bread to the gathering without considering my aunt's dietary restrictions? AITA for wanting to share my baking skills despite knowing it could potentially harm someone?

On the day of the wedding, I decided to wear a bold outfit that I thought would stand out: a bright, patterned suit that was quite different from the traditional attire everyone else was wearing. I thought it would be a fun conversation starter, and I really wanted to make an impression. I even told my girlfriend to dress in something equally vibrant so we could match.

When we arrived at the wedding, everyone was dressed in more classic wedding attire—dresses, suits, and ties in neutral colors. I quickly noticed some uncomfortable glances from family members and even my cousin, the bride, looked a bit taken aback when she saw us. Throughout the ceremony and the reception, I could sense that my outfit was distracting people from the event. My girlfriend seemed self-conscious too, which I didn’t realize until later.

At one point, my cousin pulled me aside and politely asked if I could tone it down a bit, saying that it was her special day and she wanted everyone to focus on the couple. I laughed it off and told her that it was all in good fun, and that I’d probably just steal the show instead. I thought I was being funny, but I could see her face drop a little.

Later that night, my family started making snide comments about how I was trying too hard to be the center of attention. I brushed them off, but I could tell my outfit was causing tension. I ended up getting into a small argument with my uncle, who told me I was being disrespectful to the occasion. I felt hurt and defensive, so I snapped back that they were just being boring and uptight.

To celebrate landing this job, I decided to throw a small housewarming party and invite my friends over for a casual get-together.

I planned everything meticulously, from the food to the music. However, the day before the party, I found that one of my friends (let's call her Jess) was feeling overwhelmed and was in a bad mental space. We’ve been friends for years, and I wanted to support her. I told her that she could come over the night before the party and stay with me, so I could help her feel better.

It was a great atmosphere, and everyone was having a good time, including my niece, who was just glowing with happiness.

During the party, we all sat down for cake, and my sister was sharing how much effort she put into making this day special for her daughter. Everyone was complimenting her, and my niece was beaming with pride. Instead of joining in on the compliments, I decided to take a different approach. I jokingly said, “You know, it’s just a birthday party. Kids have birthdays every year. It’s not like you’re winning an Oscar or anything.” 

The room went silent. My sister looked hurt, and my niece's smile quickly faded. My brother-in-law shot me a look of disbelief, and the other family members seemed uncomfortable. I thought I was just being funny, but it clearly didn’t land well. My sister tried to brush it off and laughed weakly, but I could tell she was upset. The atmosphere shifted, and I felt awkward for the rest of the party.

Later, my sister confronted me in private, saying that my comment was insensitive and that I ruined a special moment for her and her daughter. I dismissed her feelings and said I was just being real and that people need to lighten up about these things. I didn’t think it was that serious since it was just a joke. After the party, other family members mentioned that I should have been more supportive instead of making snide remarks.

I still don’t see what I did wrong, but a friend suggested I post here for judgment. AITA?",223,846,0.83,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_92191,2024-07-01 00:00:00,YTA,1687,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I have a close friend, Jamie, who has been trying to get back into shape. Recently, she decided to start running and training for a local 5K. I’ve been really supportive, cheering her on and encouraging her to stick with it. 

Last week, Jamie asked if I wanted to join her for a run on Saturday morning. I agreed, but I had another commitment that I had completely forgotten about until the day before. I had already promised to attend a brunch with some friends, and it was important to me because I hadn’t seen them in a while.

When I explained this to Jamie, she was disappointed but said she understood. However, I felt guilty and wanted to make it up to her, so I suggested that we could run together on Sunday instead. Jamie said she really looked forward to running on Saturday because it was part of her training schedule, and she was bummed that I wouldn’t be there.

I then made a comment that I didn’t get why she was so focused on this 5K. I told her, “It’s just a fun run, and it’s not like winning really matters.” I didn’t think much of it, but Jamie got upset and said that running was important to her and that I was being dismissive of her goals.

I feel like I was just trying to keep things in perspective and help her not take it too seriously. She’s my friend, and I want her to have fun, but I guess I did come off as unsupportive.

You're the Asshole,"I apologize for the long post, but I really need to get this off my chest.

A few months ago, my younger sister (24F) announced that she was pregnant. I was surprised but happy for her, and I made it a point to support her throughout her pregnancy. However, I’ve always been somewhat of a control freak, especially when it comes to planning events. I started throwing out ideas for her baby shower, telling her how I envisioned everything. I suggested the theme, the guest list, and even the venue.

Initially, she seemed receptive, but as I kept pushing my ideas, she started expressing that she wanted to have a say in how her own baby shower was organized. I brushed her off, saying that I just wanted everything to be perfect for her. I was convinced that I was doing it all for her benefit.

A week before the baby shower, she finally snapped and told me that she appreciated my enthusiasm but that she felt like it was becoming more about what I wanted than what she wanted. I rolled my eyes and told her that she was being ungrateful, and that if she didn't like my plans, I could just take a step back and let her handle the shower herself. I mentioned that I’d be hurt if she didn’t appreciate everything I was doing for her.

In the end, I went ahead with the plans I had made without her input. She showed up to the shower visibly upset and ended up leaving early. Now, she’s not talking to me, and I feel like I was just trying to help her. 

So, AITA for taking over the planning of my sister’s baby shower and not listening to her feelings about it?",55,2656,0.86,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_72023,2019-07-16 00:00:00,YTA,1563,AITA

You see, I've been in a long-term relationship with my boyfriend, and while we've talked about marriage, we haven't made any concrete plans yet. 

One night, after a few drinks, I vented to my sister about my feelings. I told her that I felt like I should be getting married too and that it seemed unfair that she was moving so fast. I also mentioned that I thought her fiancé wasn't good enough for her and that she could do better. She seemed upset by my comments, but I brushed it off, thinking she was just being overly sensitive.

Fast forward a couple of weeks, and my sister has been distant with me. I decided to confront her about it, and she said that my comments really hurt her feelings and made her doubt her relationship. Instead of apologizing, I told her she was being dramatic and that she shouldn't take it personally. I felt like I was just being honest and that she needed to hear it.

Now, I'm worried that I might have ruined our relationship. I just wanted her to see my perspective and know that I care about her happiness. So, am I the asshole for being honest about my feelings, even if it hurt her?",251,1406,0.84,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_75328,2021-06-30 00:00:00,YTA,1276,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I recently got into a bit of a situation with my best friend, and I’m starting to realize I might have messed up. So here’s what happened: my friend was planning a big birthday party and had been talking about it for months. He was really excited about it and had even planned a lot of activities, including a fancy dinner and a trip to an amusement park. 

The week before the party, he sent out invitations and I noticed that it was going to be quite expensive for everyone. I casually mentioned to him that I thought it might be too much for some people, especially considering that many of us are tight on money right now. Instead of being understanding, he responded pretty negatively, saying that he didn’t want to dilute his plans just because some people couldn’t afford it.

I took it upon myself to create a new event for the same day, one that was much cheaper—just a get-together at my place with snacks and games. I told everyone about my alternative plan and encouraged them to come to my event instead of his. I thought I was doing a good thing by giving people an option that wouldn’t break the bank.

When the day of the birthday party came, I ended up inviting a lot of people to mine, and as a result, only a handful showed up to my friend’s party. He found out about what I did and confronted me, really upset that I undermined his plans. In my defense, I told him it was just an option and that he shouldn’t have gotten so worked up about it.

Now I’m starting to see that maybe I should have just supported him instead of trying to create a cheaper alternative. I feel bad that my actions ended up hurting him on his special day, but I also thought I was helping out our friends.

He has a younger sister, Emily (22F), who has been very supportive and excited about our upcoming nuptials. However, there's a catch: Emily has been dating this guy, Jake (24M), for a few months, and while they seem to hit it off, I just can't stand him.

My issue with Jake is that he constantly makes inappropriate jokes and comments, often crossing the line into disrespectful territory. I’ve seen him make fun of Emily in front of her friends, and it bothers me to see someone I care about being treated that way, even if she seems happy. 

When we started planning the wedding, I decided that I didn’t want Jake at the ceremony or reception. I told my fiancé how I felt, and he tried to defend his sister's choice in partner, saying it's her life and she can date whoever she wants. I insisted that if he cared about me, he would understand my position and support me in keeping someone who disrespects me away from our special day.

I had a talk with Emily and told her that, while I appreciated her excitement, I just couldn’t invite Jake because I felt he would ruin the atmosphere. I thought I was being honest and protecting my wedding, but she ended up in tears and said I was being cruel and controlling. Now, my fiancé is upset with me too because he feels like I’m trying to dictate his sister’s life and relationships.

However, I've always been a bit uncomfortable with public displays of affection and overt romantic gestures, but I figured I could manage it since we’ve been friends for so long.

Things were going well until Jake started spending the night regularly. At first, it was fine, but as the weeks went by, I started feeling more and more annoyed. They would often cuddle on the couch, kiss constantly, and even giggle over inside jokes. I tried to brush it off, but it began to wear on me. 

One evening, while we were watching a movie, they started getting really affectionate, and I snapped. I told them, “Can you guys keep it down? It's just really awkward for me to watch you be all lovey-dovey.” They looked taken aback, and Sarah asked me why I was being rude about it. I just felt so irritated that I said, “Well, I didn’t sign up to be a witness to your romance 24/7.”

The atmosphere in the room shifted, and they both looked hurt. Sarah said I was making her feel uncomfortable in her own home, and I shot back that I was paying rent too and shouldn’t have to deal with their PDAs.

Looking back, I realize I might have overreacted. I expected them to tone it down because I was uncomfortable, which was selfish of me. But I feel like I shouldn’t have to completely change how I feel in my own space, right?

Not everyone wants to party all the time.” He looked really hurt and walked away, and I felt bad afterward, but I didn’t apologize. I figured he’d get over it.

I (28F) recently got engaged to my fiancé (30M) after dating for three years. We're both really excited to start this new chapter of our lives, and we’ve been busy planning our wedding. We decided to have a small, intimate ceremony with just close family and friends, and I thought it would be special to incorporate a few traditions from our families.

My fiancé has a younger sister (18F) who is really into photography. She’s been taking classes and has been wanting to build her portfolio, so I thought it would be a great idea to ask her to be our wedding photographer. I brought it up with my fiancé, and he thought it was a nice gesture, so I reached out to her.

She was really excited about it and agreed, but then I made a comment about how I expected her to give us a discount since we’re family. I didn’t think it was a big deal, but she looked really taken aback. She told me that she was working hard on her photography and that discounts were not something she offered, especially for a wedding. I brushed it off and said something like, “Come on, you’re family! It’s just a little discount for us.” 

After that, things got awkward. She ended up declining the offer to photograph our wedding, saying she didn’t want to mix family and business. I got really upset and told my fiancé that I thought she was being unreasonable and ungrateful. I also mentioned that I didn’t see why she couldn’t do us this favor, considering how much we were spending on the wedding.

Now, my fiancé is upset with me for how I handled the situation, saying I should have respected her work and not pressured her for a discount. A few family members have also sided with her, saying that I was being selfish. I still think I was just looking for a bit of family support and help, but maybe I went too far in my expectations.

Lately, she’s been talking about how she wants to start a YouTube channel focused on beauty and makeup. She’s really passionate about it and has been working hard to create content. 

A couple of months ago, Sarah asked me if I could help her with some video ideas and possibly film some content with her. I agreed, thinking it would be a fun way to support my friend. However, I’ve always had a bit of a competitive streak and, if I’m being honest, I’ve always wished I was more popular and had more followers on social media.

So, I started coming up with some ideas, but instead of just helping her, I secretly decided to create my own channel. I didn’t tell her about it and started filming my own beauty and makeup videos, using some of the ideas I had suggested to her. I thought it would be a fun way to show her how much I enjoyed her ideas, and maybe I'd even get more views than her.

When I finally launched my channel, I made sure to tag her in my posts and mentioned her in some of my videos, hoping to ride on her coattails a bit.

But instead, she felt betrayed when she found out I had been filming behind her back and using her ideas without giving her credit.

When she received the invitation, she told me that she loved the idea but couldn’t afford to chip in this year. I told her that I understood, but if she didn’t contribute, I would have to reconsider her invitation because it wouldn't feel fair to ask everyone else to pay for her. She seemed hurt but agreed to think about it.

A week later, she told me she still couldn't come up with the money, and I told her that was fine, but I would have to uninvite her. I didn’t want anyone to feel like they were freeloading off my celebration, and I was worried about how it would look to my other guests if she came without contributing.

One of my friends, Lisa, mentioned that she’s vegan. I thought that was a bit of a hassle, but I decided to be nice and made a small veggie platter for her, along with some grilled vegetables. However, I didn't want to go overboard, so I mostly focused on the meat dishes for everyone else.

I greeted her and offered her the veggie platter, but she looked disappointed that there was no substantial vegan option. I assured her that there were grilled veggies and sides she could eat, but she seemed a bit put out.

I was taken aback, thinking I was just venting my frustrations and that she should understand where I was coming from. I told her I was just joking and that she shouldn’t take it so seriously.

You're the Asshole,"I (25/f) recently got a part-time job at a local coffee shop. The shop has a cozy vibe and is quite popular, so I was excited to start working there. My manager is great, and I quickly got along with my coworkers. 

One of my coworkers, Jake (30/m), is really friendly and we hit it off right away. He's funny, and we share a lot of the same interests. As we worked together, he started to open up about his life, including some personal struggles he’s been through. I always made an effort to listen and be supportive, thinking I was just being a good coworker and friend.

A few weeks into the job, I noticed that Jake started to give me small gifts, like snacks or drinks. At first, I thought it was just a nice gesture, but then he began to compliment me more frequently and ask me to hang out outside of work. I wasn’t interested in anything romantic, but I didn’t want to hurt his feelings or make things awkward, so I kept it friendly and casual.

Then one day, he confessed that he had developed feelings for me and wanted to take me on a proper date. I was taken aback since I thought I had made it clear that I just wanted to be friends. Instead of being honest and saying I wasn't interested, I kind of brushed him off, telling him we could just keep things professional at work.

After that, Jake became distant and stopped talking to me as much at work. I felt bad but figured it was his choice to withdraw. A few days later, I overheard him talking to another coworker about how he felt rejected and that he was thinking about quitting because he didn't want to work with someone who didn't feel the same way.

Instead of addressing the situation, I decided to confront him about it in a slightly rude way. I told him he was being dramatic and that he should just get over it. I thought I was being straightforward, but looking back, I see that I was insensitive. 

Now, I feel guilty because I didn’t mean to hurt him, and it seems like he’s genuinely struggling with this. Some of my coworkers have said that my approach was harsh, and I realize I might have been overconfident in thinking I could handle the situation without considering his feelings.

TL;DR: I made a coworker uncomfortable by not being clear about my feelings and then being rude when he expressed his. I feel bad about how it all turned out. AITA?",742,1100,0.98,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_46493,2020-01-03 00:00:00,YTA,2334,AITA
You're the Asshole,"So, I need some perspective on a situation I've created with my boyfriend. We've been together for about two years, and generally, we have a pretty good relationship. However, there’s one issue that keeps coming up: his video game hobby.

He’s really into gaming, and I initially thought it was cute how passionate he was about it. But over time, it feels like he spends more and more time playing games instead of hanging out with me or doing things together. I love spending time with him, and I feel a bit neglected. I’ve mentioned that I’d like to have more quality time together, but he always says that he needs his ""me time"" to unwind.

Recently, I decided to take things into my own hands. I know he usually plays late at night, so one night, I unplugged his gaming console and hid the controllers. I didn't think it would be a big deal; I figured he could use a break, and we could have a nice evening together. When he found out, he was understandably upset. He said I was being controlling and that he felt disrespected because I interfered with something he enjoys.

I tried to explain that I just wanted to spend time with him instead of having him glued to a screen, but he just got angrier. Now, he’s been pretty distant, and I feel bad for what I did. I thought I was doing it for the right reasons, but I realize now it might have been overstepping.

I planned everything without consulting my girlfriend because I wanted it to be a complete surprise. I invited a bunch of our mutual friends but made sure to keep Sarah off the guest list. I just feel like she’s always overshadowing me in our relationship and I wanted this to be my moment for my girlfriend.

On the day of the party, my girlfriend was genuinely surprised and seemed happy at first. However, when she realized Sarah wasn’t there, she became upset. I told her it was my party and I wanted it to be special without any drama. She argued that Sarah is important to her and that I should have included her.

You're the Asshole,"So, I'm in a bit of a bind and could use some outside perspective. A couple of weeks ago, my best friend invited me to her wedding. We've been friends for years, and I was really looking forward to celebrating her big day. However, when I got the invitation, I realized that it was going to be a destination wedding, and I didn't have the funds to make the trip.

When I told her I wouldn't be able to attend because I couldn't afford it, she seemed really disappointed but understood. Then, out of nowhere, she suggested that I could just ask my parents for help with the costs. The thing is, my parents have been struggling financially lately, and I didn't want to put that pressure on them. I told her as much, but she insisted that it wouldn't hurt to just ask.

I brushed it off, thinking it was a strange suggestion. But then she started to guilt-trip me, saying things like, ""It's my wedding, and I really want you there"" and ""It wouldn't be the same without you."" I felt torn, but I stood my ground, saying I just couldn't do it.

Fast forward to a few days later, I got angry after seeing her post about her bridal shower online. She had a bunch of mutual friends there, and it felt like a slap in the face that I wasn't included. I made a comment on her post saying something like, ""Nice to see you all having fun without me,"" which I now realize was a bit passive-aggressive.

Since then, she’s been cold towards me, and I'm starting to feel like I might have overreacted.

Sarah is really close with this friend and has known her for years, while I barely know her. At the party, Sarah was joking around with the birthday girl, and they started talking about their favorite movies from childhood. I chimed in, trying to add to the conversation, but instead of being supportive, I started making fun of one of their favorite films. I thought I was being funny, but I could see that Sarah's mood changed instantly. 

When Sarah expressed that she didn't appreciate my comment, I dismissed her and told her to lighten up, saying it was just a joke. I thought she was overreacting. Later in the evening, I noticed that she seemed upset and withdrawn, and when I asked her about it, she said I embarrassed her in front of her friends. Instead of apologizing, I doubled down and said that she was being sensitive. 

At the end of the night, we drove home in silence, and I could tell she was still hurt. I felt justified in my actions because I thought it was just a harmless joke, and I didn’t think I needed to apologize for anything. My friends later told me that I should have been more considerate of her feelings, but I still felt like I was just being myself.

You're the Asshole,"So, I (28F) recently had a pretty big fallout with my sister (26F), and I’m trying to figure out if I messed up. 

We’ve always had a pretty competitive relationship, which I guess is typical for siblings. I graduated college a couple of years ago and landed a decent job, while my sister has been struggling to find her path. She finally decided to pursue her passion for art, which I genuinely admire, but she’s been having a hard time getting any traction.

A few months ago, she asked me to come to her first art show. I didn’t think much of it at first, but when I arrived, I realized it was in a small, local café with very few people attending. The artwork was nice, but honestly, it wasn’t anything groundbreaking. I know that sounds harsh, but I’ve seen a lot of amazing art in galleries, and this just didn’t compare.

I decided to be “honest” with her after the show. I told her that while I admired her effort, I thought she could really benefit from taking a few more courses or even getting some constructive criticism from established artists. I explained that the art world is tough, and she might need to level up her skills to make a real impact. I thought I was being supportive by suggesting she improve, but she completely blew up on me. 

She accused me of being condescending and not being happy for her. I tried to defend myself by saying I was just trying to help her see the reality of the situation. To be honest, I was a bit annoyed that she didn’t seem to appreciate my “tough love.” 

Now, she’s not talking to me, and my parents are saying I should have just kept my mouth shut and supported her unconditionally.

She’s been making some pretty decent cupcakes and has been posting pictures of them on social media, trying to drum up interest. Recently, she decided to throw a launch party where she would give away free samples and sell some of her baked goods.

I’m very skeptical about her baking skills, and I didn't think her cupcakes were anything special. I went to the launch party more out of obligation than excitement. While I was there, I noticed that her cupcakes were not as good as she claimed. In fact, I thought they were pretty dry and tasteless. 

Feeling a bit bold after a couple of drinks, I started telling people around me that I didn’t understand why everyone was raving about her cupcakes. I made comments like, “Honestly, I wouldn’t pay for these,” and “I’ve had better at the grocery store.” I could see Sarah’s face fall as she overheard me, but I just kept going, thinking I was doing her a favor by being honest.

After the party, Sarah confronted me about my comments and told me I hurt her feelings and undermined her efforts. I brushed it off and told her I was just being honest and that she should take constructive criticism better.

Instead of just letting it be, I decided to take a shortcut. I left a note on the fridge saying, “Hey guys, I’m really busy this week. Can someone clean the kitchen for me? I’ll make it up to you!” 

I figured they would understand, but nobody stepped up. So, I took a trip to my favorite fast food place and bought a bunch of snacks and drinks. I came back and left the bags on the kitchen counter, thinking it would motivate my roommates to clean up since I treated them. 

Instead of being grateful or helping out, they were really annoyed. They said I made a mess by bringing in all that food and that it wasn’t fair for me to ask them to do my chores. I argued that I was just trying to make things better for everyone and that they were overreacting.

I also suggested she look into hiring a different photographer because I had a friend whose wedding photos were stunning, and I thought it would be better for her.

As I kept talking, Sarah's enthusiasm visibly dimmed. I noticed she was becoming quieter, but I thought maybe she was just processing my suggestions. I didn’t stop, though, and I continued to critique her choices, even saying that I thought her dress choice wouldn’t photograph well. Mark finally spoke up and said, “Hey, Sarah has her vision for the wedding. Can we just support her choices instead of changing them?” I brushed it off, thinking he was just being overly protective.

After the dinner, Sarah texted me saying she felt really hurt by my comments and that I had undermined her excitement about her engagement. I was taken aback because I genuinely believed I was just trying to help. I told her she was being too sensitive and that I only wanted what was best for her wedding.

Later, my friends told me that I was out of line and that I should have picked up on his social cues. I thought I was just trying to be friendly and get him to relax, but I guess I took it too far. Now I’m wondering if I should apologize to him or if I was justified in my frustration. Am I the asshole?",936,2233,0.78,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_84423,2023-11-05 00:00:00,YTA,1238,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I (28M) recently got into a heated argument with my girlfriend (27F) over a surprise party I threw for her birthday. I planned everything without telling her, thinking it would be a fun way to celebrate and show her how much I care. I invited all her friends and family, booked a venue, and even hired a caterer.

The day of the party, I was super excited and had a lot of energy. But when I brought her to the venue, she looked completely overwhelmed. She told me she appreciated the effort but was really anxious about being the center of attention. I brushed it off, thinking she would warm up to the idea once she saw everyone there.

As the party went on, she seemed more and more uncomfortable. I tried to get her to mingle and enjoy herself, but she just wanted to leave. I thought she was being ungrateful and didn't understand why she couldn't just have fun for one night. Eventually, she ended up leaving early, and I was furious. I felt like she ruined the whole thing, and I let her know that.

Afterward, I texted her that I was disappointed she didn’t appreciate my efforts. She replied that she felt overwhelmed and that I should have talked to her before planning such a big event. I told her I didn’t see why I needed to consult her about her own birthday party, especially since I thought it would be a pleasant surprise.

Now, I'm feeling guilty because she’s upset and says I made her feel bad about her feelings. I just wanted to do something nice for her.

Recently, I found out that she’s been going on a couple of small trips with her friends, which I thought was really irresponsible. I mean, when you’re broke, you shouldn’t be spending money on leisure activities, right? So, I decided to confront her about it.

One day, I invited her over for coffee and brought it up. I told her that I didn’t understand how she could afford to go on these trips when she was struggling to pay her bills. I really laid into her, saying she should be focusing on finding a job and saving money instead of wasting it on vacations. 

She looked really hurt and tried to explain that those trips were already planned before she lost her job and that her friends had helped cover some of the costs. But I didn’t want to hear it. I told her that I thought she was being selfish and irresponsible for not prioritizing her finances, especially when I was trying to be a supportive friend by helping her out.

After our conversation, she seemed really upset and even said she needed some space. I feel like she’s overreacting, but I can’t help but think maybe I was too harsh. But honestly, I think she just needs a wake-up call.

I’m in a bit of a dilemma and need some outside perspective. So, I (28F) recently got into a situation with my roommate, Sarah (26F). We’ve been living together for about two years and generally get along well, although we have our differences.

Last week, Sarah had a big family event planned, a reunion that she was really excited about. She had invited a lot of family members and it was a big deal for her. The night before the event, she asked me if I could help her prepare some food for it, like appetizers and a dessert. I agreed because I wanted to be supportive and I know how much this meant to her. We spent a couple of hours cooking together, which was actually pretty fun. 

However, the next day, I woke up feeling kind of hungover from a party I went to the night before. I had a headache and just wanted to stay in bed. I knew Sarah would be busy getting ready for her event, but I also felt guilty for not helping her anymore. So, I texted her to let her know I was going to take it easy that day and wouldn’t be able to help her with the last-minute preparations.

She was really upset when she got my message. She ended up making all the food herself and still had to get ready, which stressed her out. I could hear her in the kitchen, clearly frustrated. When she got back from the event later that night, she was in a bad mood. She confronted me about how I bailed on her when she really needed support, and how I didn’t even consider how important this was for her. 

I tried to explain that I was feeling unwell and didn’t think I could be much help, but she was still hurt. I remember telling her that she should have asked for help earlier and that I had my own commitments too. Looking back, I realize that was pretty dismissive of her feelings.

Now, she’s still upset and it’s been a few days. I feel like I wasn’t really that bad for prioritizing my health, but I also see her point. A couple of our mutual friends have even told me I should have just sucked it up and helped her out.

I invited him over for a game night with a few other friends to help take his mind off things.

During the night, I made a joke about how he used to always bring his girlfriend along and now he was ""the lonely guy."" I thought it was a light-hearted comment, but Jake completely shut down. He didn’t laugh and just sat there looking uncomfortable. I tried to change the subject, but I kept making jokes, thinking maybe the next one would get him to lighten up. My other friends laughed, but Jake just kept staring at his drink.

Later, he left abruptly, and I found out through a group chat that he felt I was being insensitive and that I should have realized he was still hurting. A couple of our friends agreed with him, saying I should know better than to joke about something so personal. 

I honestly didn’t mean to upset him; I was just trying to make the night fun. I texted him the next day saying I was sorry if I hurt him, but I also told him he needed to lighten up a bit.

You're the Asshole,"So, I was at a local coffee shop the other day and it was a pretty busy morning. I had just finished my work on my laptop and was about to leave when I noticed a mother with a young child struggling to find a seat. The place was packed, and there were only a few small tables available.

I was sitting at a larger table that could comfortably fit four people, but it was just me there. I watched as the mother tried to juggle her child and a couple of bags while searching for a place to sit. After a few minutes of her looking around, I felt a bit annoyed that she didn't just ask anyone for a seat. I thought it was inconsiderate for her to expect someone to just give up their seat, especially since I was only one person at a big table.

Finally, I decided to speak up. I called over to her and said, ""Hey, maybe you should just take a seat at that small table over there instead of making a scene."" I thought I was being helpful, but she looked really taken aback and seemed upset. She replied that she was just trying to find a comfortable place for her and her child and that it wasn't easy for her to do that while managing everything. 

I didn't understand why she was so upset; I thought I was just offering a suggestion. After she walked away, I overheard her talking to another customer, saying how rude I was for not offering my table for her and her child. That made me feel a bit guilty, but I still thought she was overreacting.

A few years ago, I was in a relationship with a guy (29M) who I thought I would marry. We dated for about two years and were very serious. My sister knew how much he meant to me, and she even told me how much she liked him. Unfortunately, things didn’t work out, and we broke up. It was tough for me, but I eventually moved on.

Now, here’s where the problem comes in. Shortly after my breakup with him, my sister started dating him. I felt completely betrayed and hurt. I thought she had no right to date someone I had been serious with, especially after we had spent so much time together. I told her this, and instead of apologizing, she acted like I was being unreasonable. 

Fast forward to now, they’re engaged, and I can’t help but feel like I’m being forced to celebrate something that feels so wrong to me. I’ve been openly critical of her engagement, making snide comments about how she’s ""just settling"" and how ""she didn’t even really know him the way I did."" I’ve also refused to participate in any engagement celebrations or even acknowledge it in front of our family.

Sarah ended up getting really upset with me for interfering in her relationship. She said that I was being judgmental and that she liked Jake, despite his flaws. I tried to explain that I was just looking out for her, but she didn’t see it that way.

I live in a small apartment building with a shared laundry room in the basement. It’s a pretty tight space, and the machines are often busy. I usually do my laundry on Sunday mornings when it’s less crowded. My routine is pretty set; I get up early, have my coffee, and head down to the laundry room with my basket.

A few weeks ago, I noticed that another tenant, Sarah, was starting to use the laundry room at the same time as me. At first, it was fine, but then I started to get annoyed. Sarah would always take a long time, and I found myself having to wait around for her to finish. I know it sounds petty, but it really disrupted my schedule.

So, last Sunday, I decided I’d try to beat her to the laundry room. I got there super early, around 6 AM, and put my load in. I was feeling pretty smug about the whole thing. When Sarah arrived a little after me, she was surprised to see me there, but she just smiled and started loading her clothes into the second machine.

Here's where I messed up: instead of just being polite and letting her do her laundry, I started making casual comments about how it’s better to do laundry early in the morning so you don’t have to wait. I could tell she was feeling uncomfortable, but I kept talking about how my schedule was so busy and how I really didn’t have time to wait around for people to finish their laundry.

After a few minutes, Sarah said she understood and that she would try to do her laundry at a different time from now on. I thought I was being helpful, but looking back, I realize I was just being rude and dismissive of her schedule and needs. I didn't mean to make her feel bad; I just wanted to keep my routine uninterrupted.

The day of the party, my friend was stressed out and running around trying to get everything ready. She had invited a lot of people, and I could tell she was overwhelmed.

I could see that my “joke” had upset her, but I brushed it off thinking she just needed to chill a bit.

I work a steady job, but it’s just not as exciting as what she does.

Recently, she invited me to a big gallery showing of her work in a major city, and I was really excited to go. I thought it would be a great chance to celebrate her success. However, as the date got closer, I started feeling insecure about being there. I convinced myself that everyone would be looking at me, thinking about how boring my life is compared to hers.

The night of the gallery, I decided to wear a dress that I thought would make me look more glamorous. I ended up wearing a bright, sequined number that was quite flashy and definitely not my usual style. When I arrived, I quickly realized that the other guests were dressed quite stylishly but in a more subdued way, focusing on the art rather than trying to stand out. I felt even more out of place.

When I finally found my sister and introduced myself to her friends, I could sense some awkwardness. So, to break the ice, I started making jokes about my dress, saying things like, “I thought I’d bring a little sparkle to the wildlife!” My sister laughed, but then her friends started looking at me strangely. I continued to joke around, even calling attention to myself and my outfit in a way that overshadowed my sister’s work.

To celebrate, she decided to throw an engagement party and invited all her closest friends and family. I was really excited for her and wanted to make a great impression, so I offered to help with the planning. We discussed themes, food, and decorations, and I took on the responsibility of organizing the playlist for the party. I thought it would be a fun way to contribute.

I thought everyone was having a good time, but she eventually pulled me aside and told me that the songs I picked were “too much” and “not what she wanted.” I was taken aback because I had put a lot of effort into it.

Instead of apologizing or trying to understand her perspective, I snapped back and said that it was my gift to her, and she should appreciate it. I told her that if she wanted a different vibe, she should have communicated that earlier instead of letting me waste my time.

So, later that day, I shared the story with a couple of friends and laughed about it, saying something like, ""Only my sister could drive away someone she hired to help her plan her wedding over a seating chart!"" 

Now, my family is really upset with me. My parents think I should have supported her and helped her realize that yelling at someone you hire is unacceptable. Sarah is hurt and feels like I’m making fun of her when she’s already stressed. I honestly thought it was just a funny story and didn’t mean to hurt anyone, but now I feel like I might have crossed a line.

You're the Asshole,"I recently had a disagreement with my roommate, and I’m not sure if I overreacted. We share a small apartment, and I pay a bit more of the rent because I have a larger bedroom. I’ve always kept my room tidy and organized, but my roommate tends to leave his stuff everywhere in the common areas, which drives me a bit crazy.

Last week, I came home to find that he had left a half-eaten pizza sitting on the coffee table for two days. It was starting to smell, and there were flies buzzing around it. I couldn't take it anymore, so I took the pizza and threw it away. When he got home, he was furious. He yelled at me for throwing away his food and said that it was wasteful. I tried to explain that I couldn’t live with that smell and mess, but he just kept insisting that I had no right to throw away his stuff.

I told him that if he wanted to keep his food in the common spaces, he needed to be responsible and clean up after himself. He accused me of being uptight and controlling, and now there’s this tension between us. 

Looking back, I feel like I might have been too harsh and that I could have handled it better. So, AITA for throwing away his pizza?",284,1273,0.81,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_98303,2018-08-15 00:00:00,YTA,1161,AITA
You're the Asshole,"So, I (32F) recently had a massive blow-up with my younger brother (24M). I've always been protective of him, especially since our parents passed away when we were kids. I took on the role of his guardian, and I’ve tried to guide him through life, which he appreciates most of the time.

A few weeks ago, I found out he had been talking to a girl online. I didn’t think much of it at first, but then I noticed he was spending a lot of time with her, and they were planning to meet up in person. This made me really uncomfortable because, in my opinion, online relationships are risky. You never really know who someone is until you meet them in person, and I’ve seen too many horror stories about people getting hurt.

So, last weekend, when he was out with friends, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I went through his phone while he was gone and found messages between him and this girl. I was shocked at how flirty they were and how she had sent him some revealing photos. I felt like I had to protect him, so I deleted all of their conversations and blocked her number. I thought I was doing the right thing.

When he came home and found out what I did, he was furious. He yelled at me and called me controlling, saying he was old enough to make his own decisions and that I had no right to interfere in his life like that. I told him I was just looking out for him and that he could get hurt by someone he barely knew. 

He ended up leaving the house to stay with friends for a few days, and I’ve been feeling really guilty about the whole situation. My friends think I overstepped, but I genuinely believe that I was just trying to protect him from making a mistake that could cost him. 

So, Reddit, AITA for going through my brother’s phone and deleting his messages with a girl he likes because I was worried for his safety? 

TL;DR: I went through my brother's phone, found flirty messages with a girl, and deleted them because I was worried about his safety. He got mad and called me controlling.",502,1347,0.71,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_69748,2018-11-17 00:00:00,YTA,2018,AITA
You're the Asshole,"My sister and I have always had a competitive relationship, but it really escalated after she got engaged last year. I was happy for her, but I couldn't help feeling a bit envious since I've been single for a while now. When she started planning her wedding, I tried to be supportive, but in my mind, I was thinking of all the things I would do differently if it were my wedding.

When she invited me to be her maid of honor, I was excited but also felt a lot of pressure. I wanted to help, but I also wanted to make sure I stood out and that my opinion mattered. Whenever she would ask for my input, I would offer suggestions that were more about what I wanted than what she wanted. For example, I kept pushing for a color scheme and theme that I loved because I thought it would look fantastic and make for great social media posts.

Things came to a head during the bridal shower I was organizing. I planned it in a way that I thought would be trendy and popular, and I went ahead and made some decorations and a cake that were really flashy. When my sister saw everything, she was upset because it didn’t match the more understated vibe she had envisioned. Instead of apologizing or adjusting things, I got defensive and told her that she should be grateful for what I was doing. I even mentioned that if I were the one getting married, this is how I would want it.

On the day of the bridal shower, my sister ended up in tears because things were so different from what she wanted. I felt frustrated and decided to vent on social media, where I wrote a long post about how she was being overly critical and ungrateful for the effort I was putting in. I ended the post by saying that maybe she should just stick to planning everything herself if she didn’t want my help.

My sister ended up unfollowing me and telling me I crossed a line. Our family is divided now, with some people thinking I was right to express my feelings while others agree I was too harsh. I can’t help but feel like I was justified in wanting to make her wedding memorable, but now I’m starting to wonder if I was the asshole in this situation.",145,1495,0.58,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_97650,2022-08-22 00:00:00,YTA,2122,AITA
You're the Asshole,"My friend Rachel recently started dating a guy named Tom. They’ve been together for about six months, and she seems really happy. I’ve known Rachel for over a decade, and I genuinely want the best for her. However, I have some concerns about Tom. 

When I first met him, he seemed fine, but over time, I’ve noticed some red flags. He often puts Rachel down in casual conversations, like making jokes about her appearance or her cooking skills. Initially, I thought it was just his sense of humor, but it’s become more frequent, and I can see it’s starting to affect her self-esteem. 

The other day, during a small get-together at my place, Tom made a particularly nasty comment about Rachel’s outfit, saying something like, “Is that what you’re wearing? You know that color doesn’t suit you.” The whole group laughed, and Rachel looked visibly upset. I felt really uncomfortable, and I tried to change the subject, but it lingered in the air.

Later that night, I brought it up with Rachel privately. I told her that I think she deserves someone who treats her with respect and kindness, and that I was worried about how Tom talks to her. Instead of being grateful for my concern, she got really defensive. She said I was overreacting and that Tom was just joking. 

I didn’t want to push her away or come off as controlling, but I felt I had to say something. I’ve since backed off a bit, but Rachel seems to be distancing herself from me. Now, she’s been spending more time with Tom and less with her friends, and I’m starting to feel like I might have ruined our friendship by saying something.

You're the Asshole,"I need to get this off my chest, and I’m really hoping for some honest opinions. So, here’s the situation: I (28M) have a younger sister, Mia (23F), who has always been a bit of a free spirit. She's been dating this guy, Jake (25M), for about six months now. I’ve met him a few times, and while he seems okay, I’ve noticed he has some pretty different views on a lot of things compared to our family.

Recently, Mia invited us over for dinner to celebrate her six-month anniversary with Jake. I was a bit reluctant but decided to go for her sake. When we got there, the atmosphere was a bit off. Jake made a few comments about how he doesn’t believe in traditional jobs and thinks it’s better to “live off the land.” He also talked about how he thinks college is a scam and that people should just pursue their dreams without any formal education. I found myself getting increasingly annoyed as he talked, especially since Mia has worked really hard to finish her degree.

At one point, I couldn’t hold it in anymore and said, “It’s easy to say that when you’re not the one paying off student loans or working a nine-to-five.” I thought it was a fair comment, but Mia got really upset. She told me I was ruining the dinner and that Jake was just trying to share his perspective. I tried to brush it off, but I couldn’t stop myself from making more snide remarks throughout the night.

After dinner, Mia pulled me aside and told me that I was being rude and that I should have respected her choices and Jake’s beliefs. I told her that I wasn’t trying to be rude; I just didn’t understand how she could be with someone who had such irresponsible views about the future. She ended up crying and said I was being a terrible brother for not supporting her.

Now, I feel kind of bad, but I still think I was justified in my comments. I just want what’s best for her, and I worry about her being with someone who doesn’t seem to have a plan for the future.

You're the Asshole,"I (28F) have a sister (30F) who is a single mom to a wonderful little girl (4 years old). My sister has been struggling a bit since her divorce, and I try to help her out as much as I can. Recently, she asked if I could take care of her daughter for the weekend while she had a much-needed break. I was happy to oblige, and I even planned some fun activities for us.

The issue arose when I decided to do a little bit of redecorating in my home before they arrived. I love my home, but I have a lot of eclectic decor that reflects my personal tastes. One of the things I really love is my extensive collection of horror movie memorabilia, including posters, action figures, and even a few life-sized cutouts of some of my favorite characters. I’ve always been passionate about horror films, and it’s a big part of who I am.

When I was cleaning and setting up for my niece’s visit, I thought about how my decor might come off to a four-year-old. I figured it could be a little scary for her since I have quite a few lifelike figures, including a life-sized Freddy Krueger cutout. So, I decided that I would pack away some of the more intense decorations for the weekend. However, I didn’t want to take everything down, and I thought it would be okay to leave some of the lighter stuff up.

When my sister arrived, she was clearly taken aback by the decorations I left up, particularly the Freddy cutout. She told me that she was uncomfortable with it being around her daughter and asked if I could put it away. I was irritated because I felt like it was my home and my collection, and I didn’t think it was that big of a deal. I told her that I wasn't going to put it away and that if she thought it was scary, maybe she should have thought more about what kind of environment she was putting her daughter into.

In the end, she took her daughter and left, saying she wouldn’t stay in a place that made her child uncomfortable. I felt bad for my niece, but I also felt like my sister was overreacting and trying to control my space. Now I’m wondering if I was in the wrong for not accommodating her request to put it away.

So, I (30M) have a close group of friends, and we often hang out on weekends. We've been doing this for years, and it’s become a staple of our routine. Recently, my friend Mike (29M) started dating Lisa (28F), and they’ve been inseparable ever since. The problem is, Lisa is very particular about her food; she’s gluten-free and avoids all processed foods.

Last month, we planned a game night at my place, and I decided to order pizza and wings since it’s a classic choice and everyone loves it. When I put together the invite, I didn’t think to ask about dietary restrictions because I figured it was just a casual night with friends.

When Mike and Lisa arrived, I could tell Lisa looked disappointed. As the night progressed, she kept glancing at the pizza and wings and eventually asked if I had anything gluten-free. I felt really put on the spot and told her that I didn’t, but she was welcome to bring her own food next time. I tried to make a joke about how I'd never met someone who couldn't enjoy a good pizza, but it fell flat, and Lisa looked visibly upset.

After the game night, Mike texted me, saying that Lisa felt excluded and that I should have considered her dietary needs. I was frustrated because I didn’t think it was a big deal, and I felt like I shouldn’t have to cater to one person's dietary restrictions for a casual get-together. I told Mike that if they wanted to come, they could bring their own snacks next time, just like we’ve done in the past.

Now, our friend group is divided. Some think I was right to keep it casual, while others agree with Mike that I should have made an effort.

You're the Asshole,"I’m a 22-year-old woman, and I recently had a falling out with my best friend, Sarah, over a situation that I now realize I handled poorly.

A little background: Sarah and I have been friends for about five years, and she’s always been supportive of me, especially during tough times. Recently, she got into a relationship with a guy, Jake, who I had some reservations about. I didn’t think he was a good match for her, and I was worried he might not treat her well. Despite my concerns, I tried to keep my opinions to myself and just be there for her.

About a month into their relationship, I found out from a mutual friend that Jake had a reputation for being unfaithful. I decided to confront Sarah about it because I felt it was my responsibility as her friend to warn her. However, I didn’t approach the situation delicately. Instead of having a calm discussion, I ended up texting her a long message filled with accusations about Jake and how I couldn’t believe she would date someone like him. I even went as far as to say that she was ""making a huge mistake.""

Sarah was understandably upset and hurt by my words. She felt I was being overly judgmental and not respecting her choices. In her response, she told me that she was disappointed and that I had crossed a line. I didn’t take it well and argued back, insisting that I was only looking out for her and that she was blinded by her feelings.

After that, we didn’t talk for a couple of weeks. I thought she would come around and see that I had her best interests at heart, but instead, she started hanging out more with other friends and distanced herself from me. I soon realized that my approach had pushed her away rather than helped her.

Looking back, I see that I was too harsh and aggressive in my concern. I should have approached the conversation with more empathy and understanding, rather than bombarding her with negativity. I really regret how I handled things and wish I could take back my initial message.

Lily decided to throw a small gender reveal party and invited our family and friends. I thought it was a nice gesture and wanted to support her, but I couldn't help but voice my concerns.

Lily looked hurt, and the atmosphere shifted. Our parents tried to calm me down, but I continued to express my worries, insisting that people needed to understand the reality of the situation. After the reveal, which should have been a happy moment, Lily ended up crying and left the party early.

She seemed overwhelmed and I decided to spend a couple of hours going over things with her.

After that, she kept coming to me for help on various tasks, and while I initially didn’t mind, it started to become a lot.

Last weekend, I had some friends over for a small gathering, and the dog started barking non-stop. I got really frustrated, and in a moment of anger, I shouted over the fence for them to ""shut that damn dog up!"" I thought maybe that would get their attention, but it just made things worse.

My neighbor came over, clearly upset, and said that I had no right to yell at them like that, and that their dog is just being a dog. I tried to explain my side, but I could tell they were really hurt by my outburst. They mentioned that they were trying their best to train the dog, but it takes time.

Now, I feel kind of bad about how I handled the situation. My friends said I overreacted and that I should have approached it in a calmer way. I thought I was just standing up for my peace and quiet, but now I’m not so sure. AITA?",648,2967,0.98,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_21445,2019-03-19 00:00:00,YTA,1139,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I have always been very protective of my daughter, Lily (fake name). She's 16 and in high school, and I want the best for her. I tend to be a bit overbearing, but I genuinely believe it’s because I care so much.

Recently, Lily started dating a boy named Jake (fake name). At first, I was indifferent about it, but when I found out that Jake's father is a former classmate of mine who was a notorious bully, I lost it. This classmate made my life miserable back in the day, and I couldn't stand the thought of my daughter being involved with someone connected to him.

I confronted Lily about it and told her that she couldn't see Jake anymore. I tried to explain my reasons, but I was just angry and ended up yelling at her. Lily burst into tears and said I was being unfair and that Jake is a good person who has nothing to do with his father. I dismissed her feelings and told her she didn't understand what she was getting into. 

After I put my foot down, Lily went to stay with her best friend for a few days. I called her and texted her several times, but she wouldn't respond. I stood my ground, believing I was doing what was best for her. 

Now, my wife is upset with me, saying I’m being too controlling and that I need to trust our daughter to make her own decisions. I feel like I might be losing my daughter over this, but I still believe I'm right for wanting to protect her from that family.

So, a couple of weeks ago, I went to a coffee shop with a friend to catch up. While we were there, I noticed a woman sitting alone at a table with her laptop, clearly working on something. She had her coffee and a couple of pastries on her table, which I thought was a bit much for just one person, but whatever. 

As my friend and I chatted, I overheard the woman on her phone talking about how she was going to submit her art portfolio for a big exhibition. She sounded really excited and nervous, and I found myself getting invested in her success. 

When we finished our drinks, my friend headed to the restroom, and I had the brilliant idea to do something nice for this woman. I decided to ""help"" her by taking one of her pastries and leaving a note that said, ""Good luck with your portfolio! You got this!"" I figured it would be a fun surprise when she came back to her table. 

My friend came back just as I was placing the note on her table. The woman returned to her table a minute later and looked so confused and upset. She looked at me and asked if I had taken her pastry. I casually told her I thought I was being supportive and that it was a ""good luck"" gesture. 

She was clearly furious and told me that it wasn’t okay to take someone else's food, even if I thought I was being nice. I was shocked and tried to brush it off, saying it was just a little pastry and I was trying to be encouraging. My friend was also awkwardly trying to back me up, but it was clear the woman wanted nothing to do with me. 

After that, I left the café feeling annoyed that she couldn’t appreciate my ""kindness."" I mentioned the situation to some friends later, and they all agreed that I might have gone too far. Now I'm second-guessing myself and wondering if I was actually the jerk here.

To help her cope, I invited her to my place for a movie night. I thought it would be a fun distraction and a good way to lift her spirits.

As the evening went on, she started talking about her ex and how hurt she felt. I listened, but then I noticed she wasn’t really paying attention to the movies. So, trying to lighten the mood, I jokingly said, “You know, if you keep talking about him, I might just have to charge you for therapy sessions!.”

I thought it was a harmless joke, but Sarah looked taken aback. She told me she was really just trying to process her feelings and that my comment felt dismissive. I brushed it off, saying I was just trying to make her laugh. I continued with the jokes, thinking it would help her forget her problems.

Eventually, she got upset and asked me to stop making jokes. I didn’t understand why she was being so sensitive and told her she needed to toughen up. I thought I was being a good friend by trying to make her smile and not dwell on her heartbreak. 

After that night, she hasn’t reached out to me as much, and I feel like I might have ruined our friendship. I just wanted to help her feel better, but now I’m starting to think I might have crossed a line.

A few weeks ago, my sister invited me over to discuss her wedding colors and themes. I was a bit worn out from work but didn’t want to let her down, so I agreed to come. When I got there, I was surprised to see that she had set up a whole presentation with color swatches, fabric samples, and even a mood board. Instead of focusing on her ideas, I started making jokes and sarcastic comments about how all the colors looked the same and how over-the-top it all seemed. I thought it would lighten the mood, but I could see her excitement fading as I went on.

Eventually, she got really quiet and asked me why I was being so negative. I shrugged it off and continued to poke fun, telling her that nobody really cares about such details and she should just pick whatever was the cheapest.

You're the Asshole,"A few weeks ago, my friends and I decided to go out for dinner to celebrate a big promotion I received at work. We picked a nice restaurant that I've been wanting to try for a while, and I was really excited. Since it was a special occasion, I thought it'd be nice to treat everyone to dinner as a thank you for their support throughout my job search.

When we got to the restaurant, I noticed that the menu had some pretty expensive items, which I hadn’t realized when I suggested the place. I didn’t want to seem cheap, so I told everyone to order whatever they wanted, and I’d cover the bill. Everyone seemed thrilled and started ordering appetizers, drinks, and their entrees.

After we finished eating, the bill came, and it was way more than I expected. My friends had really gone all out, and I was taken aback. I started to feel a bit stressed about how I was going to cover it. In a moment of panic, when the waiter came to take our plates, I jokingly said, “If anyone wants to Venmo me for their half, that would be great!” I laughed it off, but I could see some of my friends looked uncomfortable.

Eventually, I paid the bill in full, but afterward, a couple of my friends told me that my comment had made them feel awkward and that they didn't appreciate me asking for money, even in jest. I thought it was harmless, but now I'm worried that I may have embarrassed them or made them feel like I was trying to pressure them into paying me back. 

I’ve been feeling guilty about it ever since, and I’m starting to wonder if I crossed a line.

You're the Asshole,"I've been friends with this guy, Jake, for a few years. We've always had a good time hanging out, but lately, I started to feel like our friendship was one-sided. I would always plan our get-togethers, and he rarely made an effort to reach out or suggest anything. 

A few weeks ago, I planned a birthday party for myself and invited him, along with a bunch of other friends. I was really looking forward to it, but when the day came, I noticed that Jake had been acting distant. He showed up late, didn’t really engage with anyone, and spent most of the evening scrolling on his phone. It felt really disappointing since I put in a lot of effort for my birthday.

During the party, I decided to make a toast and shared how much I valued my friends, but I also slipped in a comment about how some people should really step up their game when it comes to friendships. I was looking directly at Jake when I said this, hoping he would take the hint. 

After the party, Jake texted me saying he felt hurt by my comments and that it was uncalled for to call him out like that in front of everyone. I brushed it off, thinking he was being overly sensitive. I told him that if he felt called out, it was probably because he knew he wasn’t putting in the effort and that he should reflect on that. 

Now, he hasn’t really talked to me since, and I feel like I might have messed up our friendship. I think I was just frustrated and wanted him to realize his part in our relationship, but everyone is telling me that I overstepped and shouldn't have called him out like that.

You're the Asshole,"I recently got into a disagreement with my friend Sarah over a party we hosted at my place. I wanted to throw a small get-together to celebrate my birthday, and I invited a few close friends, including Sarah. Being a bit of a control freak, I had a specific vision for how the night should go. I wanted it to be a classy affair with nice drinks, some good food, and a chill atmosphere.

The day before the party, I spent hours preparing everything. I made a fancy cocktail, set up some decorations, and even cooked a couple of dishes myself. I wanted everything to be perfect. When Sarah arrived, she brought a couple of bottles of cheap wine and some snacks. I could tell she was excited to get the party started, but I wasn't thrilled with the vibe she was bringing.

As the night went on, Sarah started to pour the wine and play some upbeat music, trying to get everyone to dance and have fun. I felt like she was ruining the atmosphere I had worked so hard to create. I approached her and asked if we could stick to the plan I had in mind. I told her that I really wanted this night to feel special and classy, not like a wild party.

Instead of understanding, Sarah got defensive and accused me of being uptight and not knowing how to have fun. I stood my ground and insisted that I wasn't trying to ruin anyone's fun, but I just had a different vision for the evening. We ended up getting into a heated argument in front of the other guests, which made the night awkward for everyone.

Later, after the party ended, I texted Sarah to apologize, but I still felt like I was right to want a certain atmosphere for my birthday. I really just wanted to create something nice for everyone, but I think I might have come off as controlling.

You're the Asshole,"I've (28F) been married to my husband (30M) for five years. We have a great relationship and usually communicate well. Recently, he expressed interest in adopting a dog. I’ve always loved dogs, but I have severe allergies that can lead to breathing issues, and I mentioned to him that having a dog in the house might not be a good idea for my health.

For a while, we dropped the topic, but then out of nowhere, he decided to adopt a dog anyway. He brought home a cute little puppy without even discussing it with me first. I was shocked and angry when I saw the puppy; I felt completely disregarded in a decision that affects both of us. I told him that I couldn’t believe he would bring a pet into our home knowing my allergies, and that it was selfish of him to think only of his desire for a dog.

He said he thought I could manage it and that it was unfair for me to dictate what he can or can’t do. I argued that it’s not just about him wanting a dog, but it’s also about my health and well-being. The argument escalated, and now there’s tension in the house. I feel like he should have put my health first, but he thinks I’m being controlling and unreasonable.

I ended up feeling really embarrassed, and I didn’t want to ruin the picnic, so I just left the cake in the car and didn’t eat any of it.

Later on, I confronted him about how he made me feel. Instead of apologizing, he told me that I needed to be more disciplined with my health choices and that it was for my own good.

She was super excited about it but a bit overwhelmed with all the planning, so I offered to help her out. I figured it would be a great way to bond and support her, but I had my own agenda.

You see, I had just recently gotten into the business of event planning on the side, and I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to showcase my skills. Instead of just helping Jenna, I started taking charge of the planning and made it more about what I wanted. I picked the venue, the decorations, and even the catering without consulting her much.

You're the Asshole,"**Background:** I (25F) recently went on a weekend trip with my friend Sarah (24F) to a nearby city. We were excited to explore and planned to split costs for accommodation, food, and activities. We agreed to take turns paying for things to keep it fair.

**The actual question:** On the first day, I suggested we grab some snacks from a local store, and I ended up buying a large bag of chips and some drinks for both of us, totaling around 10 euros. Sarah didn't have cash on her and promised to pay me back later. I thought it was no big deal since we were splitting everything anyway.

Later that evening, we went out for dinner, and I offered to pay for the meal, thinking it would balance out since I had already covered the snacks. However, Sarah insisted on paying for our dessert afterward, which was another 15 euros. I felt a little annoyed because I was worried about keeping track of everything, and at this point, I had already spent 25 euros.

The next day, while exploring, we came across a cute little café. I suggested we grab coffee, but Sarah said she didn't want anything. I ended up buying myself a coffee for 3 euros. When we got back home, I texted Sarah, asking her to pay me back the 10 euros from the snacks and the 3 euros for my coffee since I felt like I was covering everything.

Sarah was upset and thought it was petty to ask her for that amount, especially since we were friends and on a trip together. I felt like I was just being responsible with my finances, but now I’m questioning if I was too focused on money and if I overreacted by asking her to pay me back.

You're the Asshole,"So, I recently had a situation with my neighbor that has left me feeling conflicted. We’ve always had a friendly relationship, but things took a turn when I borrowed his lawnmower. I had some overgrown grass that I needed to tackle, and I thought it would be a quick fix. He was totally fine with me borrowing it, but he did mention that it was a bit old and needed to be treated carefully.

I used the lawnmower for a few hours, and it worked great at first. However, about halfway through, it started sputtering and eventually just stopped working. I panicked a bit and, instead of telling my neighbor right away, I decided to try to fix it myself. I watched a few YouTube videos and ended up tinkering with it. Unfortunately, I made things worse and now it won’t start at all.

When I finally confessed to my neighbor what happened, he was understandably upset. He said he relied on that lawnmower and didn’t have the money to replace it right now. I felt terrible and offered to pay for repairs, but he said it was beyond fixing and he would have to buy a new one.

Here’s where I might have crossed a line — instead of really taking responsibility, I started making excuses. I told him that the mower was already old and might have broken down eventually anyway. I also implied that maybe he should have taken better care of it if he wanted it to last longer. My neighbor got really frustrated with me.

Now I’m wondering if I was an asshole for trying to deflect the blame instead of just owning up to my mistake.

She's been planning her wedding for months, and I’ve been supportive throughout the process. However, she asked me to be her maid of honor, and I agreed.

As the planning progressed, I noticed that Sarah seemed to be stressing a lot about the details, and she was spending a lot of money. I suggested a few budget-friendly ideas to help her save some money, but she brushed them off, insisting she wanted everything to be perfect.

A few weeks ago, she was venting about how her fiancé's family was being difficult about the guest list. I jokingly said that maybe she should just elope to avoid all the stress. She didn’t laugh and seemed really upset by my comment. I thought it was just a harmless joke to lighten the mood.

Recently, Sarah decided to have a small engagement party, and I was excited to help organize it. I put together a group text with our mutual friends to plan everything. However, I made the mistake of not inviting her fiancé’s family to the party because I thought it would be more relaxed without them.

They are planning a low-key wedding and have chosen to do everything themselves to save money, which I totally respect. However, they decided to host a small engagement party at our parents' house, and they asked me to help with decorations. 

Now, I consider myself quite the creative person, so I took it upon myself to go all out and create a beautiful atmosphere. I spent hours making elaborate decorations, including a big sign that said ""Congratulations!"" in glittery letters, a custom photo backdrop, and a bunch of themed centerpieces. I was really proud of my work and thought it would impress everyone.

The day of the party arrives, and my sister seemed a bit overwhelmed with the preparations. I noticed she wasn't as enthusiastic about my decorations as I expected. When the guests started to arrive, I overheard her telling a few of them that she had wanted a more minimalist style and that she felt my decorations were too much. I felt really hurt by that. I thought I was helping, but instead, it seemed like I was overshadowing her vision for her own celebration.

Later, after everyone had left, I confronted her about how I felt. I told her that I put a lot of effort into the decorations and that it was unappreciative of her to criticize my work in front of our friends. She got upset and said that she appreciated my help but wished I had just asked her what she wanted instead of going all out on my own. 

In hindsight, I realize I might have been a bit selfish and didn't consider her preferences. My friends are saying I should apologize, but I feel like I was just trying to help out.

You're the Asshole,"I (28M) have a younger sister (20F) who just started college. She's been really excited about her new life and making friends, and I’m genuinely happy for her. However, I have some issues with a few of her choices, particularly her new boyfriend, whom I’ll call Jake.

Jake is a couple of years older than my sister and seems like a nice guy at first glance. However, he has a reputation on campus for being a bit of a party animal, and I’ve heard from a few people that he’s quite the womanizer. My sister doesn’t seem to be aware of this, though, and she’s completely infatuated with him.

Last week, my sister invited me to a small gathering at their dorm so I could meet Jake and his friends. I agreed, wanting to support her, but I was a bit apprehensive. When I got there, things started off okay, but I quickly noticed that Jake was making some inappropriate jokes and comments about women that made me uncomfortable. I tried to brush it off, thinking maybe he was just trying to impress his friends.

However, as the night went on, he kept making these crude jokes, and I finally reached my breaking point. I pulled my sister aside and told her that I didn’t think Jake was a good influence and that she should be careful. I said that he seemed like someone who would just play with her feelings and that she deserved better.

She was really upset by what I said and told me I was being judgmental and unfair. I argued that I was just looking out for her, but she accused me of trying to control her life and that she’s old enough to make her own decisions.

After that, she ended up getting angry and kicked me out of the gathering. I felt bad, but I genuinely thought I was doing the right thing by warning her about Jake. Now she’s not talking to me, and I’m starting to wonder if I overstepped my bounds.

We were having dinner with a group of friends, and I was trying to lighten the mood when I made a comment about one of our friends, who is a bit of a neat freak. I said something like, “You should be careful! If you keep cleaning like that, you might just scrub a hole in the floor!” I thought it was funny, and everyone laughed. But then I added, “I mean, it’s not like you have a lot of mess to deal with, right? What’s the worst that could happen? An overturned cup?”

Well, my boyfriend suddenly got really serious and told me that my joke came off as insensitive, especially because our friend has been dealing with anxiety about her living situation. I didn’t think my comment was that bad; I figured I was just being playful and poking fun at her quirks. 

Afterward, my boyfriend kept pushing the issue, saying that my joke could be perceived as belittling our friend's struggles. I got defensive and told him he was overreacting. I mean, it was just a joke! It didn’t even occur to me that it could hurt her feelings.

You're the Asshole,"Hey everyone,

I’m in a bit of a situation and I’m not sure if I’m in the wrong. A few months ago, I started a new job at a small marketing agency. When I got there, I quickly realized that the office culture was very laid-back. Most employees, including my boss, wore casual clothes like jeans and t-shirts. However, I come from a more formal background and believe that dressing up for work shows professionalism and respect for the workplace.

As I settled in, I noticed that the dress code was pretty lax and some people would even wear sweatpants or flip-flops. I found it really unprofessional, especially when we had client meetings. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I took it upon myself to create a ""dress code policy"" that required everyone to dress more formally. I wrote it up and sent it to all the employees as if it was a directive from management, even though I had no authority to do so.

The new policy specified that everyone should wear dress shirts, slacks, and closed-toed shoes. I thought this would elevate the professionalism of our team. When I sent it out, I received a lot of backlash. Many of my coworkers were upset and felt that I was trying to impose my views on them. They argued that the relaxed dress code was part of the charm of the company and that it allowed for self-expression.

I tried to explain that being more professional would help us make a better impression on clients and could potentially lead to more business, but they didn’t want to hear it. My boss even called me in for a meeting and told me that it was not my place to dictate how others should dress.

Despite the pushback, I stood my ground and insisted that professionalism is important. I ultimately told my coworkers that if they didn’t want to adhere to the new dress code, they could discuss it with our boss. 

So, AITA for trying to enforce a more formal dress code at work?",349,1351,0.68,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_52813,2021-05-23 00:00:00,YTA,1906,AITA

Whiskers is a very affectionate cat, and he follows me around the house constantly. I can’t even go to the bathroom without him meowing at the door. It’s like he thinks I’m going to abandon him or something. It’s sweet, but honestly, it drives me nuts sometimes. I just need a little space, you know?

So last week, after another day of Whiskers being all up in my business while I tried to work from home, I snapped. I pointed at his bed and told him to go there and stay. I expected him to just settle down, but instead, he looked all sad and confused, and that made me feel even worse. My fiancé came in and saw what I did and immediately got upset with me. He told me I was being cruel and that I should treat our cat with more kindness.

I tried to explain that I just needed a break and that I was overwhelmed, but he wouldn’t hear it. He said I was being selfish and that I should be more understanding of Whiskers’ needs. I ended up saying that if I couldn't have some peace in my own home, I might as well consider finding him a new home. I didn't mean it, but I was really frustrated.

Now my fiancé is giving me the cold shoulder and says I need to apologize to Whiskers. I just don’t get why everyone is making such a big deal about this. I love the cat, but I also need some space.

However, when I suggested making a lasagna, she immediately shot it down, saying it was too heavy and unhealthy. I offered to make a healthy version using zucchini instead of pasta, but she still seemed disinterested and suggested we stick to a salad and grilled chicken instead. 

In the moment, I got frustrated and said, “You know, not everyone wants to eat like a rabbit all the time. Some of us enjoy real food!” I thought I was just being honest, but I could see her face drop. The night of the dinner party, I ended up making the lasagna anyway and brought it out alongside her salad. A couple of her friends actually preferred my dish and complimented it, which made Sarah visibly upset. 

After the party, she confronted me about it, saying I undermined her effort to create a healthy atmosphere and that it felt like I was trying to sabotage her party.

I thought it would be a great idea to throw a huge surprise party for her with all of our friends, even those she hadn’t seen in years. I ended up planning a weekend getaway to a popular party destination without consulting her first.

I brushed off her concerns, insisting that she would have fun and that I was just trying to do something special for her. I even told her she was being boring and that she needed to let loose a little.

They believe that I should have a big, lavish ceremony with all the traditional elements, including a church wedding.

Jake and I sat down to discuss our wedding plans, and he mentioned that he would prefer a small, intimate ceremony, maybe at a beach or even just a simple gathering at a park. I love that idea too, as it feels more personal and aligned with what we both want. However, when I told my parents about our plan, they were upset. They expressed that they have always dreamed of a grand wedding for their daughter and felt that we were disrespecting their wishes.

Instead of compromising, I decided that I would just go ahead with the beach wedding without discussing it further with my parents. I didn’t invite them to the planning meetings, and I didn’t tell them the date until it was set. I thought they would come around once they saw how happy we were.

I agreed, thinking it would be a good opportunity for my niece to spend time with me and my family. I also thought it would be nice to help my sister out during a tough time.

At first, everything seemed fine. My niece, let’s call her Lily, was polite and respectful. However, as time went on, I noticed that she was extremely introverted and didn't really engage with my family at all. My kids, who are 12 and 10, tried to include her in their games and activities, but she mostly preferred to sit in her room on her phone or watch TV alone. It was frustrating because I wanted her to feel welcome and part of the family, but she just wouldn’t interact.

About two weeks into her stay, I had a family gathering planned. I invited a few relatives and friends over and thought it would be a good chance for Lily to socialize. I asked her to join us, but she flat out refused, saying she didn't want to be around a lot of people. I felt embarrassed that she wouldn’t even try to socialize with my family and friends.

After the gathering, I lost my patience. I told her that if she didn’t want to engage with my family, maybe it was best for her to go back home. I figured it would be more comfortable for her and less stressful for me. I called my sister and said that Lily should come home sooner than planned.

I didn’t get why he was so sensitive about it. I was just trying to motivate him, and I thought I was being a good friend. After he opened up about how my posts and comments made him feel worse, I brushed it off and told him he needed to lighten up and not take everything so seriously.

Now he's distanced himself from me, and I'm a bit frustrated because I genuinely thought I was doing the right thing. I know I might have hurt him, but I really thought my intentions were good.

She has always been the golden child in our family, receiving a lot of attention and support from our parents for her academic achievements. Meanwhile, I've struggled with my career and have a lot of student debt.

Recently, my sister landed a great job with a tech company, and my parents threw a huge celebration for her. I couldn't help but feel a bit bitter, especially since I had been struggling to find a stable job for the past couple of years. At the party, everyone was singing her praises, and I felt like I was just in the background.

As the night went on, I ended up drinking a bit too much. I approached my sister and made a few snide comments about how nobody seemed to care about my accomplishments, even though I've worked hard to get where I am. I said things like, “Maybe if you focused less on your looks and more on your work ethic, you wouldn’t be where you are today.” I could see she was hurt, but I didn't stop there. I went on to mention that without our parents’ constant support, she wouldn’t have this job and that I was tired of her being the center of attention all the time.

My parents stepped in to calm things down, but I could tell they were upset with me. The next day, my sister texted me saying she needed some space and didn’t want to talk for a while. I feel terrible now, especially since I was just jealous and frustrated with my own situation.

I’ve been successful in my career, while she has struggled to find her footing after college. Recently, she got engaged, and I was genuinely happy for her. 

However, when she asked me to be a bridesmaid, I wasn’t sure. I love her, but I didn’t think I’d be a good fit for the role given our past. I told her I’d support her in other ways, but I just didn’t feel comfortable being a bridesmaid. She was hurt and said I was being selfish, but I stood my ground.

A few weeks later, I made plans to host a small gathering with some friends, and I decided to invite her fiancé but not her, thinking it would be a fun night for him to unwind before the wedding. When she found out, she was furious and accused me of trying to sabotage her relationship. I didn’t think it was a big deal; I just wanted to create a bond with him.

During the gathering, I jokingly brought up how I was “the better sibling” and how he was lucky to be marrying her despite her flaws. I thought it was all in good fun, but apparently, it upset him. Later, he confronted me and said that my comments were disrespectful. I brushed it off and told him to lighten up.

When I told my sister about what happened, she was even more upset. She said it felt like I was trying to undermine her happiness and that I should apologize to both her and her fiancé. I refused, insisting that they were overreacting and that I was just being myself.

You see, I’ve been married for a few years now, and when I got married, my sister didn’t want to be part of the wedding at all. She said she was too busy with work and that weddings were “boring,” so she just didn’t show up. It hurt me a lot, but I didn’t make a big deal out of it because I respected her decision. 

Now, she’s getting married and wants me to be her best man. I was a bit taken aback and told her that I wasn't really interested in being part of her wedding after how she treated mine. I mentioned how she didn’t even bother to come to my wedding, and now she expects me to drop everything and be there for hers. She got really upset and said I was being petty and that I should just let it go. 

I stood my ground and told her that I would think about it, but ultimately, I just don’t feel comfortable being in a wedding for someone who didn’t support me during my big day. 

Now, our parents are involved and think I should just get over it. They say it’s an important moment for her, and I should be there to support her. I’m starting to feel guilty, but I also think it’s unfair for her to expect me to be excited about her wedding when she wasn’t there for mine.

She was really understanding at first and said that I could wear whatever I have. But then, a few weeks later, she reached out and asked me to borrow a dress I wore to a previous wedding because she thought it would look good for her big day. I thought this was a bit rude, especially since I was already feeling bad about not being able to contribute much to her wedding. I told her that I didn’t feel comfortable giving her the dress since it reminded me of happier times when I was in a better place financially.

She got really upset and said I was being selfish and that it was just a dress. I snapped back and said that it was easy for her to say that when she wasn’t in my position. I felt like she was being inconsiderate of my struggles, and it really hurt.

I noticed my coworker, Mark (30M), has been getting a lot of praise from our manager for his work. Some of his projects are similar to mine, and while I respect his talent, I can’t help but feel a little envious.

Last week, we were both invited to present our projects at a team meeting. I decided to do something I now realize was really wrong. I had access to some internal data that showed some of the shortcomings in Mark's project, which I thought would help the team make a better decision about which project to prioritize. Instead of just presenting my work and letting it stand on its own, I brought up those shortcomings during my presentation. I didn't outright attack him or anything, but I highlighted how my project avoided those issues and even pointed to some of his presentation points as problematic.

After the meeting, I overheard some coworkers discussing how they thought I was a bit harsh, and I could see Mark was visibly upset. I brushed it off at the time, thinking I just wanted to show I was the better option. However, I've since had a chance to reflect on my actions, and I realize that I might have crossed a line.

I didn't mean to undermine him, and I thought I was just making a point about the strengths of my project. Now I feel guilty for potentially damaging a good working relationship over my own insecurities.

We’ve been checking in on her, and some of us have even offered to help with any work she might need to catch up on.

A few weeks after her father’s passing, our company held its annual holiday party. It’s typically a festive occasion, and I was really looking forward to it.

You're the Asshole,"Hey everyone, I’m in a bit of a situation and could use some perspective. 

So, I (29M) have a younger sister (22F) who just graduated from college. She worked really hard, and as a gift, our parents decided to throw her a small graduation party to celebrate. They asked me to help with the planning since they wanted to keep it simple. I agreed, but I thought it would be a good opportunity to show my support.

The party was set for last Saturday, and my parents were planning to invite close family and a few of my sister's friends. However, I took it upon myself to invite a couple of my own friends as well. I figured it would be more fun, and I wanted to show my sister that we could all celebrate together. I didn’t consult my sister or my parents about this, reasoning that it was her party and she wouldn’t mind a bit of extra fun.

On the day of the party, my friends showed up, and things started to get a little out of hand. They brought beer and started playing loud music, completely taking over the atmosphere. My sister looked uncomfortable and kept trying to talk to her friends, but my friends were being obnoxious and dominating the space. I thought it was all in good fun, but I noticed my sister getting more and more upset.

Eventually, she confronted me and asked me to tell my friends to tone it down because it was her celebration, not a frat party. I snapped and told her she was being uptight and needed to lighten up. I argued that I was just trying to make the party more enjoyable and that she should be grateful for the extra company. 

After that, my sister stormed off and spent the rest of the party in her room. The atmosphere was ruined, and my parents were frustrated, too. I felt justified in what I did, thinking I was just trying to add excitement to her celebration, but now I’m wondering if I overstepped. 

So, AITA for inviting my friends to my sister’s graduation party and making it more about having fun than celebrating her achievement?",311,841,0.94,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_59542,2022-03-25 00:00:00,YTA,1984,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I recently started a new job and quickly became friends with a coworker, Sarah. We share a lot of interests and have been hanging out outside of work too. I found out that Sarah has a boyfriend, and while they seem happy, she often shares stories about how he can be a bit controlling. I didn't think much of it at first, but over time, I noticed that Sarah would often text me during work hours about wanting to hang out, and I could tell she was feeling trapped in her relationship.

One evening, we were out together, and I suggested that we have a little fun with her boyfriend. I thought it would be harmless and a little exciting, so I texted him pretending to be Sarah, saying she wanted to break up with him. I wanted to see how he would react and if Sarah would finally stand up for herself. To my surprise, he called me immediately and started pleading with me to tell Sarah he loved her. 

I thought it was a joke and kept it going for a while. Finally, I revealed I was not Sarah and just wanted to mess with him a little. Sarah was upset when she found out and told me I crossed a line. I thought I was just trying to help her, but now I'm starting to feel like maybe I overstepped. I thought it would lead her to realize how much she deserves better, but it only created more stress for her.

I was a little too excited and decided to make a toast. In my speech, I couldn’t help but bring up how my cousin had once been in a really bad relationship before she met her fiancé. I thought I was being funny and lighthearted, reminiscing about how she used to complain to me about her ex. I even mentioned some embarrassing stories from that time, thinking it would make everyone laugh.

As I looked around, I noticed that my cousin was getting visibly upset. I thought maybe she was just being shy or didn’t appreciate all the attention. I kept going, joking that at least her fiancé seemed like a significant upgrade. Instead of laughing, the atmosphere turned really awkward, and I could tell people were uncomfortable.

After the toast, my cousin pulled me aside and told me that I had crossed a line. She felt like I had made her past a joke, and it really hurt her. I brushed it off, thinking she was overreacting, and I told her I was just trying to lighten the mood. 

When I got home, I received a bunch of texts from other family members saying that I was out of line and shouldn’t have brought up her ex at all, especially during such a happy occasion. I feel like I was just trying to be funny and celebrate her happiness.

You're the Asshole,"I have a younger brother, Jake, who has always struggled with his weight. Growing up, I was the more athletic one, and I often teased him about being slow or not being able to keep up with me in sports. I didn’t think much of it at the time; it was just sibling rivalry, right? 

Fast forward to now, I’m in my mid-twenties and Jake is 20. He’s made some serious lifestyle changes and has lost a lot of weight over the past year. I was genuinely proud of him and wanted to encourage him, but I also couldn’t help but make a few jokes about how he finally caught up to me. I thought it was light-hearted and that he’d take it in stride since we’ve always joked around.

Recently, Jake invited me to a family barbecue where he wanted to show off his progress. I was excited for him, but when I got there, I noticed he seemed a bit anxious. During the barbecue, I started joking about how he should sign up for a marathon or something, and I made a few quips about how I’d totally smoke him if we raced now. I thought he’d laugh it off, but instead, he got really quiet and just kind of shrugged me off. 

Later that evening, I overheard him talking to our mom, saying that my jokes really hurt him and made him feel like he was still the fat kid in my eyes. I felt a little bad, but honestly, I thought he was overreacting. I told my mom that I was just trying to be funny and that he needed to lighten up.

So, I went into the kitchen and started taking some leftover food from the staff. I figured they wouldn’t mind since it was already going to waste.

I ended up walking out with a few plates of food, thinking I could munch on them later. When I returned to my table, a couple of guests saw me and looked shocked. One of them even asked if I was supposed to be in the kitchen. I just shrugged it off and said I was helping out.

Later on, the couple found out about it and were really upset. They told me that it was incredibly disrespectful to take food that was meant for their guests and that it made them look bad. I thought I was just being resourceful, but now I feel guilty.

You're the Asshole,"First time posting here so please bear with me if I mess up the format.

So, I recently had a situation at work that I'm feeling pretty conflicted about and could use some outside perspective. 

I work in a small office with about ten other people, and we often have team lunches to celebrate birthdays or just as a way to unwind. Last week, it was my coworker Sarah's birthday, and we decided to go out for lunch. Everyone was chipping in for the bill, but I thought it would be a good idea to treat Sarah since it was her special day. I know she doesn’t make much money, and I genuinely wanted to do something nice for her.

When we got to the restaurant, the bill came out to quite a bit more than I anticipated because we all ordered drinks and appetizers. I ended up putting the entire bill on my credit card, which was about $150. I told everyone that I would cover it, but they could pay me back later. Most of my coworkers gave me cash on the spot, but Sarah didn’t have any cash on her. I told her it was fine and that she could just pay me back whenever she had the chance.

Well, over the next few days, I kept reminding her about the bill, but she kept brushing it off. I started feeling annoyed because I felt like I was being taken advantage of. Finally, I brought it up again in the break room, and she said she just couldn’t afford to pay me back right now. I got frustrated and kind of snapped at her, saying that it was unfair for me to have to cover her meal when I had already treated her.

My other coworkers were uncomfortable with the confrontation, and a couple of them even told me that I was being too harsh on her. I felt justified in calling her out, but now I’m second-guessing myself. Was I too aggressive in my approach? Am I the asshole for expecting her to pay me back?

You're the Asshole,"I (32m) have been friends with Jake (31m) since college. We've always had a close bond, but over the past few years, I've noticed that he’s become more introverted and withdrawn. He used to be very outgoing and social, but now he mostly stays home and plays video games. I've tried to invite him out to do things, but he often declines, saying he's too tired or just wants to stay in.

Recently, Jake started a new job that he seems to enjoy but also stresses him out a bit. I could tell he was feeling overwhelmed, so I decided to organize a small get-together with a few of our mutual friends to help him unwind. I thought it would be a nice surprise for him, so I didn’t tell him about it beforehand and just invited everyone over to my place.

The night of the get-together, I was excited to see everyone, but when Jake arrived, he looked really uncomfortable. He stood in the corner of the room, barely talking to anyone, and I could see that he was not having a good time. I tried to engage him by asking him about his new job and cracking a few jokes, but he just gave short answers and seemed anxious. 

After a while, I noticed Jake had left the party without saying goodbye. I felt a bit hurt, thinking he didn’t appreciate the effort I put into organizing the night. The next day, I texted him, asking if he enjoyed the gathering. He replied that he appreciated my effort but felt overwhelmed by the number of people and that he wished I had asked him first if he wanted to hang out.

I was taken aback by his response. I told him that he was overreacting and that I was just trying to help him socialize and have fun. I felt like I was doing what a good friend should do. I suggested that he should just try harder to socialize and not be so sensitive. Now, he hasn't responded to me in days, and some of our mutual friends say I should apologize.

Everyone was really excited about it, especially since it was a much-needed break for all of us. We decided to rent a cabin in the woods for the weekend, and everyone chipped in for the cost.

A few days before the trip, one of my friends, Sarah (27F), reached out to say she couldn’t make it because her grandmother was in the hospital. I genuinely felt bad for her, but I also thought this was a perfect opportunity to save some money since our cabin had a strict no-refund policy. So, I suggested to the group that we should go ahead and have the weekend without her and split the cost between the rest of us.

I reasoned that since Sarah couldn’t make it, we wouldn’t have to pay for her share, and it was a chance for the rest of us to save a little bit. However, my friends were really upset with me. They argued that it was inconsiderate to just dismiss Sarah's situation and go without her, especially since we had all planned to be together.

When I got defensive, saying it was just a weekend away and we could still have fun without her, they ended up deciding to cancel the whole trip instead. Now everyone is mad at me, and I feel like I did nothing wrong. I just wanted to save some money and not waste the cabin we had booked.

You're the Asshole,"Hi AITA! I'm feeling pretty upset about a situation that happened recently and could use some perspective.

So, I live in a small apartment complex with a shared courtyard where many of us like to hang out. I have a cat, and while I don't let him outside, I do take him out on a leash sometimes to enjoy the fresh air. The courtyard is a common area, and there are a few benches and some grass.

One day, I decided to take my cat outside for a little bit of sunshine. He was having a great time exploring, and I was sitting on one of the benches watching him. There was a group of kids playing nearby, and they were running around and laughing. My cat, being curious, started to wander a bit closer to the kids. I was keeping an eye on him, but I wasn't too worried as he was leashed.

Well, one of the kids thought it would be funny to run up and try to pet my cat, which startled him. He hissed and swatted at the kid, who then started crying. The kid's mom came over, and she was understandably upset. I tried to reassure her that my cat was just scared and that I was watching him, but she accused me of being irresponsible for bringing my cat outside in the first place.

Instead of apologizing or trying to make the situation better, I snapped back and told her that it was a shared courtyard and my cat had as much right to be there as her kids did. I ended up saying something like, ""Maybe you should teach your kids not to run up to animals they don’t know."" This escalated the situation, and she walked away fuming, saying she would be talking to the apartment management about my cat being outside.

In hindsight, I realize I could have handled that better. I could have been more understanding and perhaps even offered to keep my cat on a tighter leash or take him back inside to avoid any further issues. But I was frustrated and defensive.

One of my friends, Sarah, has been going through a tough time financially, and while I sympathized with her, I thought it was unfair that she didn’t contribute as much as everyone else. She was supposed to pay her share for the rental and gas, but she kept making excuses about being short on cash. To help her out, I offered to cover her half, thinking she would eventually pay me back once she was in a better situation.

Well, the road trip came and went, and it was an amazing time. We laughed, explored, and created great memories. However, when we got back, Sarah still hadn’t paid me back, and I was getting frustrated. Instead of talking to her about it, I decided to take matters into my own hands.

I created a group chat with all our friends and publicly called Sarah out, saying something like, ""It’s ridiculous how some people take advantage of others.

You're the Asshole,"My sister is pregnant and planning to have a baby shower soon. She's been super excited about it and has been discussing her plans for a while. However, she's decided to keep it really small, just family and a few close friends, which I completely understand.

The issue is that she asked me to help her organize the shower and keep it a secret from our extended family, as she wants to avoid any drama. Apparently, she believes that some of our relatives might not be supportive due to past issues. 

I think it's completely unfair to exclude our family members who would be genuinely excited to celebrate this big milestone with her. So, despite her wishes, I decided to tell our parents about the shower. I thought they deserved to know and be part of the celebration, especially since they’ve been supportive throughout her pregnancy.

Now, my sister is upset with me for going against her wishes and feels like I betrayed her trust. She’s worried that this will cause unnecessary tension and drama, which she was trying to avoid in the first place. I still think I did the right thing by letting our family know, but now I feel guilty that I might have ruined her plans.

Am I being an asshole for telling our family about the baby shower, even though my sister specifically asked me not to?",822,2592,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_87837,2019-01-30 00:00:00,YTA,1296,AITA

One weekend, I invited him over to my house for a small gathering with some of my close friends. I was really excited because I wanted him to get along with them. However, my friends can be a bit loud and rowdy, and I tend to get a bit overwhelmed when too many people are talking at once.

During the gathering, my boyfriend was trying to engage with my friends, but I noticed that he wasn't really fitting in. Instead of trying to encourage him or help him feel comfortable, I ended up making fun of him in front of my friends. I laughed and said things like, ""Look at him, he's just sitting there like a lost puppy!"" and ""Come on, join the fun!"" I thought it was all in good humor, but I could see his face turning red, and he looked really uncomfortable.

After the gathering, he told me that he didn't appreciate how I treated him in front of my friends. I brushed it off, thinking he was being too sensitive. I felt like I was just joking and trying to lighten the mood.

I'm currently working as a marketing manager, and she just landed a job as a project coordinator at a big tech company. We're both in our late twenties, and while I’ve always been supportive of her, I can’t help but feel a sense of rivalry.

Recently, my sister applied for a promotion at her job. I didn’t think she’d get it, honestly, because I believe she’s still quite inexperienced for such a role. However, she ended up getting an interview and, to my surprise, got the job. When she told me the news, I felt a wave of jealousy wash over me. Instead of congratulating her, I made a snarky comment about how getting the job was probably just a matter of luck, not skill. She was understandably hurt, and we ended up having a big argument about it.

In an effort to ""level the playing field,"" I decided to sabotage her a little. I had access to some confidential information about her new company that I learned through my connections. I sent a few anonymous tips to her boss, making exaggerated claims about her qualifications and questioning her ability to handle the new role. I figured it would show them that she wasn't ready for the position and that I was the more competent sibling.

Unfortunately, my sister found out about what I did. She confronted me, and I tried to brush it off, claiming I just wanted to help her realize that she might not be cut out for this job. Now she’s super upset with me and has cut off communication. I thought I was just trying to protect my own interests and show her that I’m the better professional.

Recently, one of my friends, Sarah (33F), has been going through a tough time with her mental health and has been open about it in our chats. 

One evening, Sarah shared that she was feeling really low and mentioned that she had been considering therapy but hadn’t made any appointments yet. She confided in us that she was afraid of what her family would think if they found out she was struggling. After our conversation, I felt it was important for her family to know because they could provide her with the support she needs. I thought it would be a good idea to give her mom a heads-up so she could help Sarah without knowing the details.

So, without asking Sarah for her permission, I decided to message her mom on Facebook. I explained that Sarah was having a hard time and suggested that her mom check in on her. I thought I was being a good friend by looking out for her. 

A few days later, Sarah reached out to me, furious. She told me I had betrayed her trust and that she felt really uncomfortable with her mom knowing about her struggles. I tried to defend my actions by saying I was just trying to help and that families should support each other. But she felt I had overstepped and said she needed time away from me.

You're the Asshole,"Last weekend, I was hanging out with my friends at a barbecue. It was a casual get-together, everyone was laughing and having a good time. At one point, the conversation shifted to relationships, and my friend Lisa started talking about her boyfriend Mark. According to her, Mark has been kind of distant lately, and she's worried he's losing interest in her.

Now, Lisa is a good friend, but she tends to be a bit dramatic, and I’ve heard her make similar complaints about Mark before. She was going on about how much effort she puts into their relationship and how she feels unappreciated. I was getting a little annoyed because it felt like she was fishing for sympathy, and I just wanted to enjoy the day.

So, out of frustration, I blurted out, “Maybe if you weren’t so high-maintenance, he wouldn’t be distant. You act like he should worship the ground you walk on just because you put on a cute dress.” I thought I was being funny, but the mood in the group changed instantly. Everyone fell silent, and Lisa looked really hurt.

I tried to backtrack and say I was just joking, but it was too late. Lisa left the barbecue shortly after, and I could tell I had ruined the vibe. My friends gave me really disappointed looks, and one of them even told me I was out of line. I brushed it off, thinking they were overreacting, but later that night, I felt guilty when I realized I had hurt my friend.

However, I've noticed that my partner has been spending a lot of time with Bella, taking her for walks, playing with her, and even sleeping with her in bed. 

I have always loved dogs but I didn’t realize how much attention and care they require. I thought I would be able to help out with Bella, but honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit neglected. It seems like my partner has become more attached to Bella than to me, and it’s been bothering me. I tried to talk to my partner about how I felt left out, but they just brushed it off, saying it’s normal for dogs to be a big part of your life.

One night, I was really feeling down about it, and I snapped. I told my partner that they were treating Bella like their favorite child and that I was starting to feel like a roommate instead of a partner. I also said that it was ridiculous to prioritize a dog over our relationship and that I was tired of feeling like I had to compete for attention. I even suggested that maybe we should consider rehoming Bella because I couldn’t handle feeling this way.

My partner was understandably hurt by my comments and said that I was being unreasonable. They love Bella and are trying to give her a good life, and my reaction made them feel guilty for doing what they believed was right. They reminded me that Bella is a living being who deserves love and attention, just like I do.

After our argument, I felt guilty for saying what I said, but I still think that my feelings of neglect were valid. I just wanted my partner to understand how I felt.

We had a good week or so, and I was happy to have him around. However, I started to feel overwhelmed by the situation. I’m an introvert, and I value my alone time.

When I brought it up, he agreed to keep it down, but it still continued. 

One night, after a particularly long day at work, I snapped at him. I told him he was being inconsiderate and that I needed him to leave. I felt terrible afterward because I knew he was going through a tough time, but I just couldn’t handle it anymore. I ended up giving him a few days to find a place to stay, which he did.

When it was time for everyone to come over, I texted the group chat saying that I had taken care of the groceries but that they could chip in. I felt like it was only fair since I had spent quite a bit, and everyone was enjoying the night together.

When they arrived, I casually mentioned I expected them to Venmo me $20 each to cover their share. Some of my friends were taken aback and thought that was a bit much, especially since I hadn't explicitly said how much they should bring beforehand. A couple of them offered to bring snacks next time instead, but I insisted that since I had already spent the money, they should still pay up.

For the past few months, Sarah has been dating a guy named Jake, and while I’ve tried to be supportive, I’ve had reservations about him. I’ve seen him be dismissive and rude to her in subtle ways, and I just don’t think he treats her well. I’ve tried to share my concerns with her, but she’s been adamant that she loves him and that I’m just being overprotective.

Last week, Sarah invited me to join them for dinner at her place. I thought, maybe this would be a good chance for me to get to know him better and see if my worries were justified. But when I arrived, things took a turn. Jake was overly confident and made a few jokes at Sarah's expense that made me uncomfortable. Instead of letting it slide, I decided to speak up during dinner. 

I called Jake out in front of both of them, saying something along the lines of, “Maybe you should tone it down a bit. It’s not cool to make fun of your girlfriend, no matter how ‘funny’ you think you are.” Sarah looked shocked, and Jake got defensive, insisting he was just joking. The atmosphere soured quickly, and Sarah ended up getting really upset. She told me I was ruining her dinner with my negativity.

After dinner, Sarah gave me an earful about how I embarrassed her and disrespected her relationship. I tried to explain that I was just looking out for her, but she felt betrayed and said she didn’t want me to come around while Jake was there anymore. 

Reflecting on it, I realize I may have overstepped. I was trying to protect her, but perhaps I could have approached this differently. Now I feel like I might have driven a wedge between us over a guy I don’t even like.

Last week, we made plans to have a movie night, just like old times. I was really looking forward to it. However, she called me a few hours before and said she was sorry but Tom had planned a surprise hike for them, and she couldn’t make it. I felt hurt and frustrated. Instead of taking it out on her, I decided to sabotage things a bit.

I messaged her and suggested that I was really into healthy eating too now, and that I'd love to join them on one of their hikes sometime.

I made fun of their relationship, their quirks, and even brought up some embarrassing moments from their past. I thought it was all in good fun, but the atmosphere quickly turned awkward, and I could see the discomfort on their faces.

After I sat down, I noticed that my cousin’s parents were visibly upset, and my cousin looked like he wanted to crawl under the table. Several guests approached me later, telling me that my comments were inappropriate and that I had ruined a special moment for the couple. I brushed it off, thinking they were just being overly sensitive.

Later, I overheard some of my family members discussing the incident, and it made me realize that maybe I crossed a line. I still think I was just trying to be entertaining and lighten the mood, but now I’m wondering if I was a total jerk for what I did. Was I wrong to think my roast would be taken as a joke?

You're the Asshole,"I recently started dating this amazing girl, Sarah. She’s intelligent, funny, and incredibly sweet. We hit it off right away, and I was really excited about the relationship. However, there was one thing that bothered me: her passion for animal rights. She’s a staunch vegan and actively advocates against animal cruelty, which is admirable, but I’ve always been a meat eater and love my BBQs.

One day, she invited me to a dinner party at her place with some of her friends who are also into veganism. I knew it would be a big deal to her, so I decided to go along, but I didn’t want to give up my favorite ribs. So, before heading to her place, I stopped by a BBQ joint and got a large order to-go.

As soon as I arrived at her home, I sat down and started eating my ribs while everyone else was having a vegan feast. I could see Sarah’s friends looking at me in horror, and Sarah’s face fell. She tried to keep it together but eventually asked me to at least step outside to eat my food. I refused and told her it was my choice and that I wouldn’t hide who I am for anyone. 

This led to an awkward atmosphere, and Sarah ended up leaving the room in tears. Her friends were supportive but clearly disapproved of my behavior. I felt a bit guilty afterward, but I also thought I was just being true to myself. Now I’m wondering if I was the asshole for bringing my food to her vegan dinner party and eating it in front of everyone.",472,2025,0.53,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_35455,2024-10-19 00:00:00,YTA,1432,AITA
You're the Asshole,"So I (30F) recently got a promotion at work, and with that, I decided to treat myself to a nice new car. I've always wanted a luxury vehicle, and I finally felt I could afford it. I went out and bought this really expensive SUV that I absolutely love. 

My sister (28F) is currently struggling financially. She lost her job a few months ago and hasn't been able to find a new one yet. She's living on a tight budget and is constantly stressed about money. I know she's going through a tough time, but I didn't think it was my responsibility to help her out financially.

A couple of weeks ago, I invited her over to show off my new car. She seemed excited and happy for me at first, but then she started making comments about how I could have used that money to help her instead of buying a ""fancy toy."" I brushed her off, saying it was my hard-earned money and I deserved to treat myself. 

Things escalated when she started crying, saying that I was being insensitive and selfish for flaunting my wealth while she was struggling. I ended up telling her that she should have made better life choices and that her financial problems were not my fault. 

Now, my family is divided. Some agree with me, saying I have every right to enjoy my success, while others think I should have been more supportive of my sister. I feel justified in my actions, but I'm starting to wonder if I might have been too harsh. AITA?",839,1763,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_14988,2021-09-15 00:00:00,YTA,1412,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I (28F) recently moved in with my boyfriend (30M), and while unpacking, I came across a bunch of old photos from my childhood. I thought it would be fun to share some memories with him, so I started showing him pictures from family vacations, school events, and my various hairstyles over the years.

As I was flipping through the album, I found a photo of me at a school talent show where I was dressed up as a clown. I thought it was hilarious and decided to show it to my boyfriend. He chuckled a bit but then made a comment about how “clowns are kind of creepy.” I found this really dismissive, especially since I was trying to share something that was important to me.

I snapped back and said, “Well, sorry if I’m not as perfect as you want me to be.” He looked taken aback, and I could see that he was hurt. Instead of apologizing or explaining, I just kept going, saying things like, “You think you’re so much better than me because you have this ‘cool’ image, huh?” 

He tried to diffuse the situation by saying he didn’t mean to offend me and that he actually thought I looked cute in the photo, but I was too worked up to listen. In the heat of the moment, I ended up throwing the album across the room and storming out of the apartment for a bit to cool down.

When I came back, he was quiet, and I could tell he felt uncomfortable. I ended up apologizing later, but I still feel like I was justified in how I reacted because I felt like he was belittling my childhood and experiences.

You're the Asshole,"So, last weekend was my best friend's wedding, and it was a big deal with lots of guests. I was a groomsman, and my girlfriend (GF) was excited to be my plus-one. However, we had a bit of a situation leading up to the big day.

A few days before the wedding, GF suddenly asked if she could bring her younger sister (S) along as well because she felt bad leaving her out of the festivities. I hesitated because I thought it would be awkward with an extra person, and I also wanted to spend quality time with GF and our friends. But I didn’t want to say no outright, so I said, “Let’s just see how it goes.”

On the day of the wedding, everything started well. The ceremony was beautiful, and I felt lucky to be part of it. However, as the evening went on, I noticed S was getting a bit rowdy and overly excited at the reception. She was dancing wildly and even spilled a drink on my friend who was the best man. I felt embarrassed and frustrated, but I didn’t want to ruin GF’s night by making a scene.

After a while, GF and I found ourselves at a table with some other guests, and S was still off dancing. I tried to enjoy the evening, but I was getting increasingly annoyed at how S was acting. Finally, I snapped and said to GF, “Can you please get your sister under control? She’s making this awkward for everyone!” I immediately regretted saying it, but I was frustrated.

GF looked hurt and said, “She’s just having fun! It’s a celebration.” I insisted that it was inappropriate and that S needed to tone it down. The mood shifted, and I could feel people around us turning to listen. GF ended up leaving to find S, and I felt bad for ruining the vibe of the night.

Later, GF told me I ruined her night by being judgmental about her sister. I thought I was just trying to maintain some decorum, but now I realize I was being harsh and inconsiderate of her feelings.

You're the Asshole,"So I have this friend, let’s call her Sarah, who’s been trying to lose weight and get healthier for a while now. I’ve always been supportive of her journey, but I have to admit, I don’t really understand it. I’ve always been naturally thin and have never had to worry about my weight, so I guess I don’t grasp how challenging it can be.

A few weeks ago, we planned a girls’ night at my house to catch up and have some fun. I decided to make a bunch of snacks and a nice dinner for us to enjoy. I knew Sarah was on a diet, so I tried to include some healthier options, but I also made a lot of my favorite comfort foods, like mac and cheese and pizza.

When she arrived, I noticed she looked a bit uncomfortable as she surveyed the spread. I thought it would be funny to tease her a little, so I joked, “Come on, Sarah! Just one slice of pizza won’t ruin your whole diet!” I thought it was a lighthearted comment, but she kind of laughed it off awkwardly.

As the night went on, I kept bringing up her diet in a joking way, like mentioning how good the mac and cheese was and how she should just let loose for one night. I didn’t mean any harm; I really thought we were having fun. But by the end of the night, I could tell she was feeling really down. She barely touched the food and seemed distant.

The next day, she texted me to say she felt really upset about the comments I made and that it felt like I was belittling her efforts to get healthier. I was taken aback and felt like she was overreacting. I mean, it was just a joke, right? I told her she was being too sensitive and that I was just trying to lighten the mood.

Now she’s not talking to me much, and I can’t help but feel frustrated. I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings, and I don’t think I did anything wrong. I’m considering messaging her again to apologize, but part of me thinks she needs to just get over it.

I was super excited and spent a lot of time preparing for it—researching the company, practicing my answers, and even picking out a nice outfit.

The day of the interview, I felt really confident, but when I got there, I started to get really anxious. I ended up overthinking my responses and stumbling through some of the questions. I left feeling defeated and convinced that I had blown my chance.

Later that day, I was venting to my best friend about how terrible I felt and how I probably wouldn’t get the job. Instead of being supportive, my friend tried to encourage me by saying that I did my best and that it was okay to not be perfect. I rolled my eyes and told them that I didn’t want to hear it; I wanted to talk about how awful I was at the interview. I also mentioned that they should know better than to try to cheer me up since they’ve never had to deal with job interviews themselves.

My friend got upset and told me I was being rude and dismissive of their attempts to help. I didn’t think I was being rude; I just wanted to vent and have them listen to me. I feel like they should understand that I needed to express my frustration without getting unsolicited advice. Now, I’m wondering if I was out of line for shutting them down like that.

You're the Asshole,"So, I have a bit of a story that’s been weighing on my mind. A few months ago, my best friend, Sarah, got engaged to her long-time boyfriend, Jake. I was really happy for them and I was excited to be part of the wedding planning process. 

As we started picking out colors and themes, Sarah mentioned that she wanted to keep things simple, maybe a small wedding with just close family and friends. I thought that was a great idea, but I also felt like I wanted to go all out and help her make it a memorable event. I’ve always dreamed of having a big wedding, and since she didn’t seem too enthusiastic about the idea, I decided to take matters into my own hands.

I began researching extravagant venues, florists, and catering options without really discussing any of it with Sarah. I started sending her ideas and getting really excited about planning this big celebration. The more I talked about it, the more I realized how much I wanted to be in charge of the whole thing.

One day, I even went ahead and booked a venue that was way out of their budget and told her how amazing it would be. Sarah was shocked and really upset. She told me that this was her wedding and she wanted to keep it small and intimate, but I brushed it off, insisting that I was just trying to make it special for her.

I thought she’d come around, but instead, she ended up feeling overwhelmed and stressed out about all the changes I was trying to make. I thought I was helping her, but now I realize I was just being selfish. I ended up ruining the experience for her and making it all about what I wanted.

However, I decided to wear a t-shirt and jeans because I thought it would be comfortable and casual, you know? I didn't think it was a big deal since I figured most people would just be there to enjoy the day and not focus on what I was wearing.

When I arrived, I noticed everyone else was dressed up in nice dresses and suits, but I didn’t really care. I made a few jokes about how I was going for the ""laid-back"" look, and I thought it was funny. A couple of guests even gave me strange looks, but I brushed it off.

During the reception, I ended up making a few sarcastic comments about the fancy food and the decor, saying stuff like, ""This is way too fancy for a bunch of people just sitting around!"" A few guests looked uncomfortable, but I still thought I was being humorous. At one point, the bride pulled me aside and told me that my outfit and comments were disrespectful to the occasion, and I just laughed it off, saying it was just a wedding and not a big deal.

I later found out that some family members were upset because the wedding was a special occasion and they felt like I was ruining the vibe. I honestly didn’t think I did anything wrong, but now I’m wondering if I was the one being inconsiderate.

I was really excited to celebrate my birthday and wanted to host a small gathering with my closest friends. I planned everything out, including a fun karaoke night since we all love singing, and I even ordered a cake from a bakery that I really like.

As the day approached, one of my friends, Sarah, reached out to me and mentioned that she had just gotten a promotion at work. She was thrilled and wanted to bring her boyfriend to the party to celebrate with us. I thought that was great and invited them both. However, as the party day came closer, I noticed that Sarah kept mentioning how much she wanted the night to be about her promotion and celebrating it.

On the day of the party, everything was going smoothly until the karaoke started. Sarah insisted on taking the mic almost immediately and started singing songs that she felt were “empowering” for her new job. I was happy for her success, but I felt like it was overshadowing my birthday celebration. I tried to get the group to sing songs from my playlist, but she kept interrupting, saying she wanted to perform her favorite songs about success.

Sarah became upset and accused me of being selfish for not letting her enjoy her moment after working hard for her promotion. I snapped back and said if she wanted a celebration for her job, she should have thrown her own party instead of trying to hijack mine.

As the night went on, I decided to get up and make my own toast.

I was hesitant but thought it would be okay if we gave them a little bit, so I suggested we lend them a small portion.

The couple had a strict dress code that they communicated clearly on their invitations, which was formal attire only. I was excited to dress up for the occasion, but as the date approached, I realized that my budget was tight, and I couldn’t afford a new dress.

In a moment of desperation, I decided to wear a dress I already owned that was more casual than what the invitation specified. I thought it would be okay since it was still a nice dress, albeit not as formal as expected. To make it look a bit more upscale, I paired it with some fancy accessories and did my hair and makeup nicely. I figured that as long as I looked presentable, it wouldn’t matter too much.

She smiled but then hesitated and said, “I appreciate you coming, but I had hoped everyone would respect the dress code I set.” I felt embarrassed and defensive, responding, “You know how expensive things can get. I couldn’t afford a new dress. It shouldn’t matter if I’m not in the latest fashion as long as I’m here to celebrate with you.” 

She looked hurt and said, “It’s not just about fashion; it’s about the effort to respect my wishes for my wedding.” After that, I decided to leave early, feeling humiliated and angry.

Recently, I came across a limited edition console that I absolutely had to have. The only problem was that it was being released in a bundle with a few games that I already owned. It was a bit pricey, but I figured it was worth it because I really wanted the console.

Here’s where I might have crossed a line. Instead of just buying the bundle, I decided to buy it, keep the console, and then sell the games I already owned online. I thought it was a win-win situation. I’d get the console I wanted and make back some money by selling the duplicate games.

But then, I realized that the games were actually pretty popular, and I could sell them for a decent amount more than I paid for the bundle. So, I kept the games for a few more weeks, kind of holding them hostage while I figured out the best way to sell them. In the end, I ended up selling them for a significant profit, and I felt really good about it.

However, I didn’t consider the fact that a lot of my friends were also interested in buying those games. They had been looking for them and would have preferred to buy them from me directly, but I didn’t even think to offer them a chance before selling them online. When they found out what I did, they were pretty upset with me. They felt like I was taking advantage of the situation and being greedy.

Now I’m feeling guilty and wondering if I was an asshole for not offering the games to my friends first. I thought I was just being smart and resourceful, but I can see how it might have come off as selfish.

You're the Asshole,"Last weekend, I hosted a small gathering at my apartment for some friends. I invited about six of my close pals and we decided to have a game night with snacks and drinks. To make it easier, I offered to buy the snacks and drinks, and everyone agreed to chip in a little money.

I went to the store and picked up a ton of snacks: chips, cookies, some fancy cheeses, and a variety of drinks. When I came back, I laid everything out on the table and noticed that I had bought way more than necessary. I figured it was better to have too much than not enough.

As the night went on, I started munching on the snacks while we played games. At some point, I got really into the chips and ended up eating a large portion of the bowl without realizing it. My friends started to notice and one of them, Sarah, pointed out that I had eaten most of the chips and there were hardly any left for everyone else.

I laughed it off and said, ""What can I say? I’m just really hungry!"" But honestly, I didn’t think it was a big deal. I paid for all the snacks, so in my mind, I felt entitled to enjoy them as much as I wanted.

Later, Sarah confronted me again, saying that it was rude for me to eat most of the snacks when everyone had chipped in. I told her she was overreacting and that it was just a bit of chips. It turned into a bit of a heated argument, and eventually, she left the gathering early, clearly upset.

Now I’m wondering if I went too far and if I should have been more considerate of my friends' feelings. So, AITA for eating most of the snacks at my own gathering?",31,2356,0.8,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_57873,2020-01-20 00:00:00,YTA,1569,AITA

A few weeks ago, my best friend asked me to help plan her wedding, and I was excited at first. However, as we started discussing her ideas, I quickly realized that I didn't like most of her choices. I felt that her vision was too casual and not elegant enough for a wedding.

Instead of supporting her, I began to push my own ideas. I started suggesting more formal venues, different color palettes, and even a higher-end catering service, all while dismissing her preferences as ""too laid back."" I often interrupted her when she tried to explain her vision and would say things like, ""That's not what brides do,"" or ""You should really consider something more sophisticated."" I thought I was being helpful, but looking back, I can see I was just being controlling and critical.

My friend eventually got upset and told me that I was making her feel bad about her choices and that I was taking away the joy of planning her wedding. I blew up at her and said she was being unreasonable and that I was only trying to help her have the best wedding possible.

I have a pretty demanding job that has been really stressful, and I’ve been trying to manage my personal life on top of that.

Last weekend, my best friend invited me to her birthday party. I was excited to go, but it was also the same day we had planned to do a big cleaning session at home. I asked my partner if we could reschedule the cleaning to another day since I really wanted to celebrate with my friend. He agreed but made a comment about how it was just like me to prioritize my social life over our home. I brushed it off at the time, but it stuck with me.

The day of the party came, and I ended up having a great time. I had a few drinks, took lots of pictures, and felt really carefree for the first time in a while. I got home late, and my partner was obviously upset. He confronted me about how I didn’t help clean and how I chose to party instead of being responsible. I felt defensive and snapped back, telling him that he was being controlling and that I deserved a night off.

We ended up in a huge fight where I accused him of being unsupportive and he accused me of being irresponsible. I took it too far and told him that it was pathetic that he couldn't handle me enjoying my life. I know I raised my voice and said some hurtful things, but I felt so overwhelmed and didn’t know how to communicate my feelings without lashing out.

I invited her in, and we ended up chatting for a while. 

Later that week, I decided to host a small dinner party for some friends. I prepared a big meal and had a few people over for food and drinks. As the party was in full swing, I heard another knock at the door. It was my neighbor again, and she looked a little uncomfortable but said she could smell the food from the hallway and was curious if I had any extra. 

I felt a little put on the spot, and honestly, I didn’t want to share my food with someone I barely knew. So, instead of offering her a plate, I jokingly said, “Sorry, we’re all out! Just a small gathering!” I could see her face fall a bit, and she laughed awkwardly before saying it was fine and leaving. 

After the party, I found out that she was actually quite upset about it and felt excluded, which I didn't realize at the time. A few mutual friends mentioned she was disappointed and that I might have come off as rude.

My girlfriend was a bit tired and opted to stay behind, but I asked her cousin if she wanted to come along. She said she would rather stay and read a book.

It turns out her cousin had gotten scared while I was gone. She heard some noises outside and thought someone was trying to break in, so she called my girlfriend in a panic.

A few months ago, my brother (27) and his girlfriend (24) announced that they were expecting a baby. I was thrilled for them and excited to become an aunt. However, things took a turn when my brother asked me to be the godparent. 

I initially felt honored, but then I started thinking about my own life. I’m 29, single, and haven’t really figured out my career yet. I’m still trying to find my footing and honestly, I’m not sure I’m ready for that kind of responsibility. So, I told my brother that I couldn’t be the godparent because I felt like I wouldn’t be able to provide the support a child would need. I thought I was being honest and responsible.

My brother was really hurt. He said he had expected me to step up and support them. He reminded me that being a godparent is more about being there for the family than anything else and that they would appreciate my presence in their child’s life. I just felt overwhelmed by the pressure and said I didn’t want to be tied down to that commitment when I’m still figuring myself out.

To make matters worse, after I declined, I started to avoid spending time with him and his girlfriend. I didn’t want to face the disappointment or talk about the baby. I thought it would be easier to just keep my distance. But now, my brother has grown increasingly frustrated with me, saying I’m being selfish and that family should support each other through big life changes.

I was thrilled, and I wanted to celebrate, so I decided to throw a small party at my apartment and invite my closest friends and coworkers.

At one point, I got frustrated with how my brother was handling everything, and I made a sarcastic comment in front of his friends, saying something like, ""I guess family only matters when it’s convenient for you."" It didn’t go over well, and he got really upset, saying I was ruining the night and that it wasn’t my party to dictate.

After that, I noticed he seemed to be in a bad mood for the rest of the evening. Some of his friends also looked uncomfortable, and I felt embarrassed. I thought I was just making a point, but I could tell I had crossed a line.

At the end of the night, he told me I was being a jerk and that he regretted asking for my help. I felt bad, but I also thought I was justified in wanting to include family.

You're the Asshole,"My (29M) sister (27F) recently got engaged, and she asked me to be one of her groomsmen. I was really excited for her and immediately said yes. However, I couldn't help but bring up the idea of throwing a bachelor party for her fiancé. I mentioned how fun it would be to take him and some buddies out for a wild weekend.

When I presented the idea to my sister, she seemed hesitant. She told me that her fiancé isn't really into the typical bachelor party stuff and would prefer something more low-key, like a dinner or a weekend trip to a cabin with close friends. I brushed it off and said that he might just need to loosen up a little and that a wild party would be good for him.

Despite her protests, I took it upon myself to plan a big night out. I organized a party with strippers, loud music, and a bunch of friends from college who were all about the party scene. When I finally unveiled the plan to my sister, she was furious. She felt like I didn't respect her fiancé's wishes and that I was disregarding their relationship.

You're the Asshole,"So, I (24M) have a close group of friends who I’ve known since high school. We hang out all the time and support each other through everything. One of my friends, let’s call him Jake (25M), recently started dating a girl, Sarah (24F), who we all know, and while I’ve always thought she was nice, I never really had any strong feelings for her.

About a month into their relationship, Sarah invited the whole friend group to her birthday party, and of course, I was excited to celebrate with them. However, I was kind of surprised by how much attention Jake was giving her, which just felt excessive to me. They were all over each other, and it made me feel a bit left out since I was used to Jake being more present with all of us.

At some point during the party, I jokingly said to Jake, “Hey man, save some of that love for your friends!” I thought it was all in good fun, but Jake looked annoyed and told me to chill out. I brushed it off, thinking he was just being overly sensitive.

Later that night, when the party was winding down, I overheard Sarah talking to another friend about how she felt like Jake was smothering her and how she needed space. I thought it was a good opportunity to give my ‘wise’ two cents and told her, “Honestly, you should just tell him to cool it. He’s kind of being a lot right now.” She looked at me surprised and said, “I appreciate your concern, but maybe I should handle it my way?”

The next day, I got a text from Jake saying he was upset with me for talking to Sarah about their relationship and that it was really none of my business. I was taken aback because I thought I was just looking out for him. I told him he was being overly dramatic and that I was only trying to help him see things from a different perspective.

Now, looking back, I realize that I probably overstepped by getting involved in their relationship when I really had no place to say anything. My friends have started to distance themselves from me, and I can't help but feel like I messed up.

I planned everything without telling my ex-wife, who shares custody of our son. I made a guest list, booked a venue, and organized activities without consulting her at all.

When the day came, my son was thrilled to see all his friends there. He loved the cake, the games, and everything I had planned. However, I saw my ex-wife standing at the entrance, looking upset. She hadn’t been informed about the party and felt excluded from the celebration of our son’s birthday. She confronted me in front of the kids and said it wasn't fair that she had no say in the planning and that she would have wanted to be involved.

I dismissed her concerns, saying it was a surprise and that my son was having a great time. I told her she could either enjoy the party or leave, but I wasn’t going to let her ruin the day. I thought I was doing something amazing for my son, and I didn’t understand why she was making it about herself.

So, I (29M) have a close friend, Sarah (28F), who is getting married in a few months. She has been super excited about her wedding and has been talking about her dream dress for years. Recently, she found a beautiful gown that she’s been trying on and is convinced it’s ""the one."" 

Here’s the thing: Sarah has gained quite a bit of weight over the last year, and while I understand that it’s been a tough time for her, the dress she’s chosen is really tight-fitting. When she showed me the dress, I could see that it didn’t fit her properly—there were visible bulges and it looked uncomfortable. I couldn’t help but feel that she should consider a different style that would be more flattering and comfortable for her.

I know this is a big moment for her, and I just wanted to be honest as her friend. So, I told her that I thought the dress wasn’t the best choice for her current body and that she might want to look for something more forgiving that would celebrate her as she is. I mentioned that I cared about her happiness and comfort, and I didn’t want her to feel self-conscious on her big day.

She got really upset and accused me of body-shaming her. I tried to explain that I was coming from a place of love and concern, but she just kept saying that it was her choice and I should support her. Now, she’s not speaking to me and some mutual friends think I was out of line.

One day, while we were having a few drinks, Mark started talking about how he felt like he was losing his identity after the breakup. I thought it would be funny to lighten the mood, so I made a joke about how he should just start dressing like a completely different person and reinvent himself. I even suggested he could wear a bright pink suit and a fedora.

I thought he was just being overly sensitive, so I kept pushing the joke, adding more ridiculous ideas about how he should act “fabulous” and “out there.” I thought it was all in good fun, and I really wanted to help him see the humor in his situation.

Later, I found out that my comments really bothered him. He confided in another friend that he felt like I was making fun of him at a time when he was feeling vulnerable. I still didn’t think it was that big of a deal, so I brushed it off when my other friend told me what Mark said.

You're the Asshole,"TLDR: I criticized my sister's wedding planning, saying it was too simple and not special enough; she got upset and now I'm feeling guilty.

My sister has always been a bit of a minimalist, but I thought her wedding was going to be a chance for her to really go all out and create something beautiful. She got engaged last year and started planning her wedding for this coming summer. I was really excited at first, but when I saw her venue choices and the simple decorations she picked out, I couldn't help but voice my opinions.

She chose a small, rustic barn for the ceremony and reception, which honestly looked charming at first. But when I visited her to discuss her plans, I noticed she had decided on very basic decorations – just some string lights, a few wildflowers in mason jars, and simple wooden tables without any tablecloths. I was shocked; I thought she could do so much more to make it feel magical and memorable.

In my excitement (or maybe overzealousness), I told her that her wedding was going to be really bland and unremarkable. I said something along the lines of, ""You have to do something more than this; it just doesn't feel like a wedding."" She looked hurt and said she liked the simplicity and wanted it to reflect their personalities. But I pressed on, insisting that every wedding should have some level of grandeur and that people would judge her for it.

She got visibly upset and told me that I was being really unsupportive. I thought I was just being honest and trying to help her create a perfect day. After our conversation, I realized I may have crossed a line when she texted me later saying she needed some space because my comments really affected her.

I still think weddings should be more than just a simple gathering, and I just wanted her to have a day she could remember forever. But now I'm second-guessing myself. AITA?",87,1978,0.81,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_61283,2024-07-25 00:00:00,YTA,1871,AITA

Last month, she received a scholarship that she worked really hard for, and I was extremely proud of her. Our parents decided to throw her a small graduation party to celebrate her achievement, inviting family and close friends.

A week before the party, my sister asked me if I could help her with a project for her college application. She wanted to create a video showcasing her journey through high school, including photos, clips, and some commentary. I agreed to help her, but I was also quite busy with work and personal projects.

The night before the party, I stayed up late to finish the video for her. I ended up highlighting some of her most embarrassing moments for fun, like her awkward middle school phase and some cringeworthy dance videos from family gatherings. I thought it would be a hilarious addition to the video.

During the party, everyone gathered to watch the video. As it played, I noticed my sister becoming increasingly uncomfortable. When the embarrassing clips played, I laughed along with the family, but I could see my sister’s face turning red. After the video ended, she was clearly upset and tried to brush it off, but I could tell she was hurt.

So, I (28F) have a close group of friends that I’ve known for years. Recently, one of my friends, Sarah (27F), started dating a guy named Mike (30M) who I’ve never met but have heard some things about him that make me uncomfortable. Apparently, he has some pretty outdated ideas about women and doesn’t treat Sarah the best, at least according to what she has shared with us.

I’ve noticed that when she’s around him, she tends to be less confident and more reserved, which is not how she usually is. I really care about Sarah and I want her to be with someone who treats her right and supports her. I brought up my concerns to her, but she brushed them off and insisted that he’s a good guy.

Now, I’m throwing a birthday party next month, and I was really excited about it. I sent out the invites to my friends, but I decided to let everyone know that Mike is not welcome at the party. I figured that since I’m hosting, I have the right to decide who gets to come. I told Sarah that I didn’t want any “toxic energy” at my party, and that since I believe Mike is not good for her, he shouldn’t come.

She was really upset and said that it felt like I was trying to control her life and her relationships. I felt bad when she said that, but I also think that I was just trying to protect my friend from making a mistake. Some of my other friends backed me up, while others thought I was being unreasonable.

Now I’m questioning whether I overstepped. Was I wrong to exclude Mike from my party, even if I’m concerned for Sarah? AITA?",630,2226,0.9,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_26239,2024-09-07 00:00:00,YTA,1608,AITA
You're the Asshole,"So, I’ve been living in this apartment with my girlfriend for about six months. We both work from home, and we have a pretty good routine going. I’m a night owl, while she’s more of an early bird. She likes to wake up around 6 AM and do her morning routine, including yoga and meditation, which is great for her, but I’m usually up late working or playing video games.

Recently, we decided to have a movie night on a Saturday. I bought a bunch of snacks, and we settled in for a late-night binge. Around 11 PM, I got a bit too loud with the game I was playing during the movie, and she asked me to keep it down because she was trying to relax. I snapped back and told her it was just a game and she needed to lighten up. 

The next day, she mentioned that she felt a bit overwhelmed with my late-night habits and the noise levels, especially since it disrupts her sleep schedule. I brushed it off, saying she was being dramatic and that I shouldn't have to change my lifestyle just because she's an early riser. I told her that if she didn’t like it, she could just wear earplugs or something. 

Things got a bit tense after that, and I could tell she was upset. She even suggested we compromise and I could play my games with headphones, but I refused, saying it was my space too and I shouldn’t have to make sacrifices. I reminded her that when we moved in together, we agreed to respect each other's habits, but I felt like she was being unreasonable now.

Anna has always wanted a large wedding with all the traditional elements, and I completely understand why it's important to her.

I have a pretty busy life with my job and my own commitments, but I promised to help her out with some of the planning. However, things got really hectic at work, and the week before the wedding, I realized I wouldn’t be able to help as much as I initially promised. I was feeling overwhelmed and stressed, and I decided to take a much-needed break instead. 

On the day of her wedding, I had planned a spa day for myself, thinking it would be a good way to unwind amidst all my stress. I didn't think to inform Anna about my plans until the morning of the wedding. When I finally told her, she was incredibly hurt and upset. She expressed that I should have been there to support her on one of the most important days of her life.

I, on the other hand, am more of a homebody and enjoy lounging and binge-watching shows on the weekends. Recently, Mark invited me to join him for a weekend hike, and I reluctantly agreed, thinking it would be a nice way to bond.

During the hike, I struggled to keep up with him. He was super fit and energetic, while I was panting and feeling out of shape. At one point, I felt so exhausted that I suggested we take a break. Instead of being understanding, Mark rolled his eyes and said something like, “Come on, you need to push yourself more!” I took it personally and got annoyed. 

To cope with my frustration, I started to make sarcastic comments about his obsession with fitness, saying things like, “What’s next? Are you going to start eating kale smoothies for every meal?” I thought I was being funny, but it seemed to just irritate him more. 

After the hike, I told him I didn’t think I would join him again for any of his fitness activities. He seemed hurt, and I brushed it off, thinking he was being too sensitive. I feel like I was just being honest about how I felt, but now I’m starting to wonder if I was too harsh on him.

You're the Asshole,"Okay, so I’ve been mulling over this situation and I guess I’m ready to face the music.

Some background: I (27f) have a close-knit group of friends. We often hang out, and we take turns hosting game nights at each other’s homes. Last week, it was my turn to host. I was excited to have everyone over, but I also had a lot going on: I had a big project due at work, and I was really stressed about it. Despite that, I wanted to make sure the game night was fun and memorable.

I set everything up in my living room and even prepared snacks and drinks. However, as friends started to arrive, I noticed my best friend, Jake (28m), was acting a bit distant. He was on his phone a lot and seemed distracted. When I asked him what was up, he said he was dealing with some personal issues but didn’t want to talk about it.

At one point during the night, I could see he was getting increasingly upset. So, instead of asking everyone to engage with the games, I decided to focus on Jake and see if he needed support. I pulled him aside and asked him if everything was okay. He opened up about feeling overwhelmed with work and a recent breakup. I felt really bad and wanted to help him feel better.

However, instead of curating the game night for our other friends, I ended up spending most of the night comforting Jake. I ignored everyone else, who were left hanging and not enjoying the night. I could hear whispers of frustration from others, but I brushed it off, thinking my best friend needed me more at that moment.

By the end of the night, my friends were disappointed and let me know they felt neglected. I tried to explain that I was just trying to be a good friend to Jake, but they didn’t see it that way. They felt like I prioritized one person over the entire group, and I can’t help but agree—I let my friends down.

Now I’m wondering if I messed up by focusing so much on Jake instead of balancing the needs of everyone. I just wanted to be there for him, but now I feel like I ruined the game night.

However, when it came time to plan her bridal shower, I took it upon myself to organize it without even consulting her. I figured, “She’s busy, and I know her taste better than she does!” 

I booked a venue, hired a caterer, and sent out invitations—all without her input. When I finally revealed everything to her, she was shocked and clearly overwhelmed. She told me that she felt sidelined and that she wanted to be more involved in planning her own shower. I brushed it off and said she should just be thankful that I was taking the initiative.

Things escalated when she expressed that she had a vision for a more intimate gathering at her home with close friends, but I had planned a bigger party with a lot of her extended family and acquaintances. She said she felt like I didn’t respect her wishes, and I told her that she was being ungrateful for all the work I’d done.

I ended up getting really upset and told her that if she didn’t appreciate my effort, maybe I shouldn’t even bother planning anything for her at all. Now she’s upset with me, and we’re not speaking.

Ever since he was a kid, he loved playing video games and has always dreamed of becoming a professional gamer. He’s been practicing a lot and even joined a local team. I always thought this was a phase and that he should focus on something more stable and realistic, like getting a degree.

Last week, he came to me excitedly, sharing that he had been accepted to a gaming competition with cash prizes. He wanted my support and encouragement, but instead, I jumped in and told him that he was wasting his time. I brought up how competitive and risky the gaming industry is and insisted that he should really consider going to college instead. I even said things like, “What if you don’t make it? You’ll end up with nothing.” 

He looked really deflated by my response. I told him that he should be more responsible and think about his future. I mentioned that I’ve worked hard to establish my career and that he should take inspiration from that instead of chasing unrealistic dreams. I also said that he was incredibly lucky to have the opportunity to go to school and shouldn’t throw it away on a hobby.

He was visibly upset and said that I didn’t understand him at all and that my words felt like a betrayal. I told him that I was just trying to look out for him and help him make the right choices. I thought I was being practical and tough love would be beneficial.

Afterwards, I mentioned our disagreement to a friend, and she said I was being really harsh and that I should apologize to him for belittling his passion. I don’t see it that way at all—I just wanted him to be realistic and not set himself up for failure.

You're the Asshole,"For context: I have a three-year-old Golden Retriever named Bella. Bella is very energetic and loves to play fetch and go on long walks. I got her as a puppy, and she’s been my best friend since then. 

Now the actual scenario: Recently, Bella has been acting a bit differently. She’s been barking more when I leave the house, and I’ve noticed that she’s started chewing on furniture and shoes when I’m gone. It’s frustrating because I raised her to be well-behaved, and I've always trained her to understand what's okay and what's not. I’ve tried ignoring the behavior at first, hoping it would pass, but it hasn’t. 

After a few weeks of this, I decided that the best course of action would be to punish her. I felt that maybe a little scare would teach her a lesson. So, one day when I came home and found she had chewed up my favorite pair of shoes, I took her collar and gave her a light, but firm smack on the nose while shouting “NO!” I thought this would make her understand that what she did was wrong. 

After that incident, her behavior didn’t change. She seemed more anxious, and I felt guilty for how I had reacted. I tried to spend more time with her and give her extra attention, but I could tell she was still a bit on edge around me. I didn’t want to believe that my punishment had caused her stress, and I continued to think that she just needed to be disciplined more.

Now, my friends and family have started suggesting that I should look into positive reinforcement training instead, and maybe even consider taking her to a trainer. They say that hitting her was unnecessary and could make her more anxious. They even mentioned that it could damage our bond. I brushed it off, thinking that I was just trying to teach her to be a good dog.

So, a bit of background: I (29F) have a younger sister, Sarah (24F), who has been in a relationship with this guy, Jake, for about two years. The problem is, Jake has a pretty troubled past. He has a history of substance abuse, and while he claims to be clean now, I can't shake the feeling that he's a bad influence on my sister. I've seen how he treats her, and I genuinely believe she deserves someone better.

As my wedding date approached, I started to feel increasingly uncomfortable with the idea of Jake being at my wedding. I worried about the atmosphere he might create, and I didn't want any drama or negativity on my special day. I had several conversations with Sarah, expressing my concerns and urging her to reconsider her relationship with him. I thought I was being a supportive sister, but she became really upset and defensive, insisting that Jake has changed and that he makes her happy.

In the end, I decided to uninvite Sarah from my wedding unless she chose to come without Jake. I told her it was my day, and I wanted it to be perfect without any potential issues. She was heartbroken and cried when I told her, saying I was being a terrible sister and that I was trying to control her life. I felt bad, but I stood my ground.

We've been friends for a few years now, and we often hang out on weekends, playing video games and going out to grab food. Mark is quite the charmer and has a way with women. He's been dating this girl, Sarah, for about six months.

Here's where things get complicated: I think Sarah is really attractive, and, to be honest, I initially had a bit of a crush on her when I first met her. I didn’t act on it because I value my friendship with Mark, and I certainly wouldn’t want to hurt him. But lately, I've noticed that I enjoy spending time with Sarah a lot more than I should. I find myself thinking about her more often, and I catch myself flirting with her a little bit, jokingly, but it’s definitely more than just friendly banter.

One night, Mark had planned a game night, but he couldn't make it at the last minute. Instead of canceling, Sarah texted me asking if I still wanted to hang out. I thought, ""Why not?"" We ended up having a great time, and I made a few jokes that I could tell made her laugh a bit too much.

As the night went on, I couldn't help but flirt with her a little more, and at one point, I leaned in to whisper something funny, and it felt like there was this tension in the air. I even caught myself thinking about how I would kiss her if things were different. I didn't act on it, but I really wanted to. I told myself it was just harmless fun.

After that night, I couldn’t stop thinking about her. I started texting her more often, and we began to develop a closer friendship, which I started to enjoy way too much. Mark found out that we had hung out without him and confronted me about it, asking if I had feelings for Sarah. I laughed it off, but I can tell he’s starting to get suspicious.

Issue: Recently, I decided to get a new dog. I’ve always wanted one, and I found an adorable puppy that I instantly fell in love with. I didn’t consult my husband beforehand because I felt that since we have separate accounts for personal spending, I could make this decision on my own.

I argued that it was my money and I shouldn’t have to run every little decision by him. I genuinely thought he would be excited about the new addition to our family. Instead, he accused me of being selfish and not considering his feelings. Now, there’s tension in our home because he feels blindsided.

At one point, my sister's friends decided it would be funny to play a prank on me. They took my cake, which I had been waiting to cut and share with everyone, and started throwing pieces at each other. I was furious. I told them to stop, and when they didn't, I snapped.

I yelled at them to get out of my house and ruin my party. I may have called them ""selfish children"" and told my sister that she should have kept them in line. My friends were shocked, and it created a really awkward atmosphere. My sister ended up in tears, and my friends looked uncomfortable.

After everyone left, I felt terrible. I know I overreacted, but I was just so frustrated with the situation. I tried to apologize to my sister, but she said I embarrassed her in front of her friends and that I ruined her night too. 

Now I'm left wondering if I was the asshole for blowing up at my sister's friends, or if I had every right to defend my party. 

AITA?

You're the Asshole,"So, here's the situation. I’m part of a community soccer team, and we practice every Saturday morning. We don’t have formal positions, but I usually play midfield because that’s where I feel I can contribute the most. We have a pretty good dynamic, and everyone knows their roles.

Last weekend, a new guy joined our team. He seemed eager and enthusiastic, which is great, but he made it clear that he usually plays as a forward. During practice, he kept trying to take the spot I usually occupy, and I felt really uncomfortable. Our coach had already set up the drills, and I was in my usual position, but this new guy kept insisting that he deserved to be there instead because he was “better” at scoring goals.

Instead of just talking to him about it or suggesting that we rotate positions, I decided to just ignore his requests and stayed put. I didn't want to budge, and I figured if I just played hard, he would get the hint. Throughout practice, he ended up getting frustrated and stormed off after a while, saying that I was being a jerk for not letting him play where he wanted.

Looking back, I realize I could have handled it better. I should have communicated and found a way to incorporate him into the drills without disrupting the flow of practice. Now I feel bad because I made him feel unwelcome when he was just trying to join in.

So, AITA for not letting him take my spot during practice?",232,1517,0.78,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_99349,2019-11-10 00:00:00,YTA,1409,AITA
You're the Asshole,"My girlfriend and I have been together for about three years. We both share a love for cooking, and we often try new recipes together. Recently, she started a food blog to document our culinary adventures, and I was really supportive of it. I even helped her set it up and took the photos for her first few posts.

However, I’ve always been a little insecure about my cooking skills. I think I’m decent, but I often feel like I’m in her shadow. She has a natural talent for creating stunning dishes, while I tend to stick to simpler recipes. I don't think she ever meant to overshadow me, but it sometimes feels that way.

One night, we were having friends over for dinner, and we decided to make a fancy three-course meal. As we were preparing, I suggested making a dessert that I used to make with my mom when I was a kid. I thought it would be a fun and nostalgic addition to the meal. She agreed, but when I started gathering the ingredients, she took over and said she would handle it since I wasn’t very experienced with desserts.

Feeling hurt and dismissed, I told her that if she was going to take over my idea, I wouldn’t help with the dinner at all. I ended up sulking in the living room while she finished cooking. When our friends arrived, I barely interacted with them because I was still upset. My girlfriend was frustrated with me and said I was being childish and ruining the evening.

After our friends left, we had a big argument. I accused her of always making me feel inadequate in the kitchen, and she said I was being jealous and petty. In retrospect, I realize that my reaction was over the top, and I should have just communicated my feelings rather than sulking.

So, AITA for getting upset and refusing to help with dinner because I felt overshadowed?",139,2308,0.53,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_14122,2024-09-14 00:00:00,YTA,1778,AITA
You're the Asshole,"So my sister recently had a baby, and she threw a small baby shower to celebrate. She invited close family and friends and asked everyone to bring a small gift for the baby. I thought this was a bit ridiculous since I already bought her a really nice crib as my gift. 

I decided that instead of bringing a gift, I would just show up with a bottle of wine for myself. When I arrived at the shower, I made a big deal about how I didn’t feel like spending money on another gift since I had already done so much. I even made a joke about how ""gift giving can be so overrated."" 

During the shower, I spent most of the time drinking and laughing loudly, not really engaging with the activities my sister had planned. At one point, I interrupted her while she was opening gifts to tell a story about how I didn’t think it was fair for everyone to expect additional gifts when I was being so generous with my presence.

After the shower, my sister confronted me about my behavior, saying I had ruined the atmosphere and disrespected her special day. I got defensive and told her she was being overly sensitive, and that I didn’t see what the big deal was. Now, a lot of our family is upset with me too, saying I should have been more supportive and considerate. I still think I was just being honest and that people need to lighten up.

A few months ago, she mentioned wanting a cat because she loves animals and thinks it would be great for the both of us. At first, I was hesitant because I’m not really a pet person and I worry about the commitment and responsibility that comes with it. 

However, she kept bringing it up, talking about how much joy a cat would bring into our home, and I eventually agreed to consider it. I thought we could look at some shelters together and make a decision as a team.

But then, out of nowhere, last week she brought home a cat without discussing it with me first. She was so excited, saying she couldn’t help herself and found this adorable kitten that needed a home. I was shocked and honestly really upset. I told her that it was unfair to make such a big decision without me, and I felt like she disrespected my feelings by not waiting for us to discuss it.

She argued that I was being unreasonable and that I should have just been more open to the idea from the start. We ended up having a huge fight over it, and I told her that if she wanted a cat so badly, she could take care of it all by herself. I’ve been really cold towards her and haven’t helped with the cat at all since it arrived.

You're the Asshole,"This is my first time posting here, so please be gentle with me.

I (17F) have a younger sister (14F) who is really into dance. She’s been taking classes for years and recently got the opportunity to audition for a prestigious dance academy. She’s been practicing non-stop, and I could see how much it meant to her. My parents have been super supportive, driving her to rehearsals and getting her new dance gear, which I think is great.

Now, I’ve always been more into sports, particularly soccer, and I’ve been training hard for my upcoming season. It’s something I’m passionate about, and I had been looking forward to my first game of the season. 

The issue started the week of my sister’s audition when my parents decided to host a small gathering for family and friends to cheer her on. They asked me to help set up and promote it on social media, which I initially agreed to out of support for my sister. But as the days went on, I began to feel frustrated. I had my first soccer game on the same day as her audition, and I was excited about it. I expressed to my parents that I wanted to focus on my game and not miss it, but they insisted that my sister’s audition was more important and that I should be there to support her.

The day of the audition came, and I ended up missing my soccer game. I felt really bitter about it, especially when I saw my friends posting about their matches and winning. I was resentful that my parents had pushed me to put my sister first, and I took it out on her. After she got home from her audition, I snapped at her, saying things like, “You always get everything, and I never get to do what I want.” I told her that I didn’t care about her dance as much as she thought I should, and that it felt unfair that everything revolved around her.

She started crying and ran to our parents, who were obviously disappointed in me. I feel bad now because I know how much she worked for this and that it was a big moment for her. My parents said I was being selfish and that I should’ve been more supportive. I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings, but I was just so frustrated about missing my game and feeling overlooked.

So, AITA for snapping at my sister during a time when she needed my support? 

TL;DR: I got frustrated missing my soccer game to support my sister’s dance audition and lashed out at her, feeling overlooked. Now I’m questioning if I was in the wrong.",373,529,0.65,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_18281,2021-09-04 00:00:00,YTA,2408,AITA

Growing up, I was always the ""popular"" one, active in sports, and I guess you could say I was a bit of a mean girl. I often commented on Mia’s weight, thinking it was just tough love. I would say things like, “If you want to be pretty, you need to lose some weight,” or, “Don’t you want to be as popular as me?”

Recently, Mia started dating someone seriously, and she seems really happy. However, I can’t help but feel the need to “help” her out, so I decided to throw a surprise birthday party for her. I meticulously planned everything, but I also thought it would be a good idea to invite a few of my fit friends and have a fitness theme. I encouraged Mia to wear a cute workout outfit and even suggested a group workout session for the party.

When Mia showed up, she looked a bit uncomfortable, but I brushed it off. During the party, I made several jokes about how everyone should be on a “diet” after the holiday season and said things like, “It’s all about balance!” in a light-hearted tone. My friends laughed, but I could see Mia’s face change. She ended up leaving early, and I felt a bit annoyed with her for being so sensitive.

When I talked to her later, she told me that the party made her feel terrible about herself and that I should have been more supportive, especially given her struggles.

My brother (28) has been dating his girlfriend (27) for about two years now. They're seriously talking about getting engaged, and honestly, I really like her. She’s great for him, and I can see them having a future together.

However, I found out something that I thought was pretty significant. A few months ago, I was hanging out with some mutual friends, and one of them mentioned that my brother's girlfriend had a pretty intense past with substance abuse during her late teens and early twenties. She has been clean for a couple of years now, but it seems that she used to get into a lot of trouble, including some legal issues related to drugs. 

I know that my brother really values honesty and transparency in relationships, and I felt like this was something he absolutely needed to know before making a lifelong commitment. I reached out to her and asked if she had told him about her past. She said she hadn’t and that it was behind her. She seemed to think it was irrelevant now that she was clean.

But I couldn’t let it go. I decided that I would give her a deadline of two weeks to tell him. When the deadline came and went with no word, I made the decision to tell my brother myself. I figured he deserved to hear it from me, especially since I was looking out for him.

So, I sat my brother down and told him everything I had learned. His face went pale, and he was clearly shocked. He thanked me but told me he needed some time to process this information. He called off their plans for engagement and decided to take a break from the relationship, saying he needed to reassess everything.

Now, my family is furious at me for what I did. They think I overstepped and ruined a good relationship. My brother's girlfriend is hurt and feels betrayed, and I can’t help but feel like I did the right thing by making sure my brother wasn't blindsided.

You're the Asshole,"Some background:

I've been friends with a group of people since college, and we’ve all been really close for years. Recently, one of my friends, Jake, has been going through a tough time after a breakup. He’s been really down, and the rest of the group has been supportive, encouraging him to get out and socialize more. I wanted to help him feel better and thought it would be nice to have a get-together at my place this weekend.

Main story:

I decided to host a small gathering and invited everyone from our friend group, including Jake. I thought it would be a great way for him to unwind and reconnect with everyone. However, I also invited my new girlfriend, Sarah, who I’ve been dating for about three months. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but she tends to dominate conversations and always wants to be the center of attention.

When the day of the gathering arrived, Sarah immediately started making jokes and drawing everyone’s attention to herself. I noticed that Jake was sitting quietly in a corner, looking increasingly uncomfortable as the evening went on. I tried to include him in conversations, but every time I did, Sarah would jump in and steer the conversation back to herself. 

At one point, Jake quietly mentioned that he was feeling a bit overshadowed and suggested we play a game to lighten the mood. Instead of supporting his idea, I dismissed it and told him that everyone was having fun with what we were doing. I didn’t want to rock the boat, and I thought Sarah would be upset if we changed things up. 

After a couple of hours, Jake ended up leaving early, saying he wasn't feeling well. I later found out from another friend that he felt really hurt and excluded, and he was disappointed that I didn’t stand up for him when Sarah was monopolizing the conversation. I reached out to him to apologize, but he told me he felt abandoned and that I should have prioritized him, especially considering what he’s been going through.

Now, I feel torn. I want to be supportive of Jake, but I also want to nurture my relationship with Sarah. When I talked to Sarah about it, she got defensive and said she didn’t mean to take attention away from anyone. I told her I thought she could tone it down a bit in situations like this, but she thinks I’m being unreasonable.

AITA for not prioritizing my friend when I was hosting, and for not standing up for him? Is my girlfriend the asshole for not realizing how her behavior affected Jake?",732,2135,0.81,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_72560,2020-12-31 00:00:00,YTA,2470,AITA

3. It’s a Saturday night, and I’ve had a long week at work. I was really looking forward to a quiet night in, and I didn’t want to spend the evening in a crowded bar.

4. I also felt like he was inviting me out of obligation rather than because he genuinely wanted me to be there. I hate feeling like I’m just a checkbox on someone’s guest list.

5. To top it off, I didn’t want to deal with the pressure of having to buy him a gift or something when I wasn’t even excited about attending. I figured it was better to just decline and avoid the whole situation.

Later in the evening, she pulled me aside and told me that I shouldn’t have made that comment because it made her feel bad for not serving my dish. I waved it off and told her she was being too sensitive.

As the night went on, I continued to joke around about my lasagna, insisting that it was the best one there and that everyone was missing out. A few of the guests even tried to taste it, and I felt proud when they complimented it, but I still didn’t think about how my comments affected my friend.

After the party, a mutual friend reached out to me and said that my jokes about my lasagna had upset my birthday friend, and that I should apologize. I brushed it off, thinking she was overreacting and that I didn’t need to say sorry for making a joke. 

Now I’m starting to wonder if I was too harsh on her, or if maybe I should have been more considerate of her feelings on her special day. Am I the asshole?",269,546,0.99,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_41377,2023-03-18 00:00:00,YTA,2118,AITA
You're the Asshole,"My friends and I have a close-knit group that loves to hang out and joke around. We often tease each other, and it’s usually all in good fun. However, one of my friends, Jake, has been going through a tough time lately. He recently lost his job and is struggling to find a new one. I thought it would be funny to lighten the mood, so I made a joke about how he should just ""apply to be a professional napper"" since he’s been spending a lot of time at home.

At first, everyone laughed, including Jake. But later, I noticed that he seemed a bit off. When I asked if he was okay, he said he didn't appreciate the joke. I brushed it off and made a few more comments, thinking I was just trying to cheer him up. I even said something like, ""Come on, it was just a joke! If you can’t laugh at yourself, what can you do?""

Eventually, Jake snapped and said that it was hard for him to see the humor in his situation. It made him feel worse, and I realized that my jokes were really insensitive given what he was going through. I apologized, but I didn’t think it was that big of a deal at the time.

A few days later, Jake decided to distance himself from our group, and I heard from other friends that he felt hurt and unsupported. I still think I was just trying to be funny and that it wasn’t a huge issue, but now I feel guilty about it.

Recently, she had a bad flare-up and had to cancel plans we had with my friends for a game night. I was disappointed but understood her situation. However, the night of the game, I decided to go without her because my friends were really looking forward to it, and I didn’t want to let them down. I told her I would just be gone for a few hours, and she said it was okay, but I could see she was a bit upset.

At the game night, I ended up talking about her a lot, joking about how ""she’s always sick"" and how I might need to find a ""backup girlfriend"" who can actually keep up with my social life. I thought it was all in good fun, but my friends didn’t seem to find it funny. A few of them even told me I should be more supportive of her instead of making jokes at her expense.

When I got home, my girlfriend confronted me about what I said. She was hurt and felt like I was making light of her illness. I shrugged it off, saying I was just joking and that it was all meant to be lighthearted. She told me I should be more considerate and that I crossed a line.

I got frustrated because I felt like she was ruining the vibe. After a couple of hours, I snapped and told her to either participate or leave. I said something like, ""If you're not going to join in, maybe you should just go home."" Everyone went silent, and Sarah looked really hurt. She eventually just got up and left without saying anything.

I love her a lot, but I’ve noticed she tends to be pretty disorganized, especially when it comes to her studies. She constantly complains about feeling overwhelmed and stressed, and I try to support her as best as I can.

A few weeks ago, she had a major exam coming up, and I could see she was getting more and more anxious. The night before the exam, I offered to help her study. I was willing to quiz her and help her review her notes. Instead of taking me up on the offer, she insisted she had it all under control and didn’t need my help. I respected that, but I was still a little worried.

The next day, I texted her during the exam to wish her luck, and she seemed really flustered in her responses. Later that evening, she called me, and she was upset. It turned out she didn’t do well on the exam, and she was blaming her disorganization and anxiety for it. Instead of comforting her, I told her, “Maybe if you had just listened to me and let me help you, you wouldn’t be in this mess.” I thought I was being honest and trying to make her see that she needed to take my advice more seriously.

She got really quiet after that and eventually hung up on me. I felt bad later, but I didn’t see what the big deal was. I was only pointing out the truth. I honestly thought that maybe if she realized how much she needed help, it would motivate her to change.

Now, she hasn’t talked to me much since then, and I’m starting to wonder if I was too harsh. I still think she should have known better, but I also feel like I could have handled it differently.

The issue arose when I invited a few of her friends without really discussing it with her first. I thought she’d be fine with it since we’ve always had similar friend groups, but when I told her the plan, she seemed really upset.

I felt like I was just trying to make her happy, and I didn't think it would be a big deal to invite a few more people.

Instead of stepping in and calming her down, I just laughed it off and told her it was fine because I thought it was funny at the time.

Things escalated when Sarah decided to challenge some of my other friends to a drinking game. They were hesitant, but she insisted, and I thought it would lighten the mood. Ultimately, she got completely wasted, and I just let her be, thinking it was all in good fun. 

As the night went on, Sarah ended up passing out on my living room floor. I didn’t want to deal with it, so I just left her there and went to bed. The next morning, I woke up to a huge mess and found out that some of my friends had to help Sarah get home. She was embarrassed and upset, and I felt a bit guilty, but I brushed it off and told her it was all good.

Now, she’s upset about how the night went down and has been telling mutual friends that I didn’t look out for her and let her get out of control. I think she’s overreacting and that I was just trying to have fun with my friends. I don’t think I owe her an apology or should feel bad for what happened since she’s an adult and made her own choices.

So, am I the asshole for not taking responsibility for Sarah's behavior at my gathering?",299,2793,1.0,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_73988,2019-07-09 00:00:00,YTA,1714,AITA
You're the Asshole,"My friend Emily has been dating her boyfriend, Jake, for about a year now. They seem happy together, but I’ve noticed some concerning things. Jake is a bit controlling; he often tells Emily what she should wear and who she should hang out with. I’ve tried to talk to her about it, but she brushes it off and insists that he just cares about her.

Last week, Emily invited me over for dinner, and Jake was there. I didn’t mean to cause any drama, but during dinner, I mentioned how much I loved a certain band and how I was going to their concert next month. I assumed Emily would be interested too, but Jake scoffed and said, “Why would she want to go to that with you? She’s not into that kind of music.” I felt awkward and decided to push back a bit, saying, “Well, maybe if you let her make her own choices, she’d be able to explore her interests.”

Emily looked uncomfortable, and Jake got really defensive. He told me to mind my own business and that I was being disrespectful. I felt justified in standing up for her, but later, Emily texted me saying that I embarrassed her in front of Jake and that I shouldn’t have brought it up. I apologized, but I still think I was just trying to point out the controlling behavior in a way that would help her.

You're the Asshole,"I (30M) recently had a falling out with my younger sister (24F). We’ve always been close, but things took a turn during her engagement party last weekend. 

At the party, I was chatting with some family and friends, and I jokingly mentioned how she has always been a bit of a control freak when it comes to planning. I thought it was harmless fun and that everyone would laugh, but my sister didn’t take it well. She got visibly upset in front of everyone and ended up walking away from the conversation.

Afterward, she confronted me privately and told me that I made her feel embarrassed and that I should’ve kept my mouth shut. I brushed it off, saying it was just a joke and that she needed to lighten up. I mean, I thought it was all in good fun, and everyone else was having a good time.

The next day, she called me crying, saying that I ruined a special moment for her and she felt unsupported. I still didn’t think I did anything that wrong. I told her that if she’s going to have a big party, she should be able to take a joke. Now she’s not speaking to me, and I feel like she’s overreacting.

You're the Asshole,"My girlfriend (27F) and I (29M) have been dating for a little over two years. We have a really good relationship, but there’s one thing that has caused tension between us: my love for video games. I play a lot, sometimes for hours on end, and while I try to balance it with my responsibilities, I often find myself prioritizing gaming over spending time with her.

Recently, my girlfriend expressed her feelings about this. She told me that she feels neglected and that I often choose to play games instead of hanging out with her or doing things together. I brushed it off at first, thinking that she was being overly dramatic. After all, I believed that I could game whenever I wanted as long as I was still fulfilling my obligations.

One weekend, she planned a special date night for us, something she had been looking forward to for weeks. However, when the time came, I got completely engrossed in a new game that had just been released. I told her I would join her in a bit, but I kept saying ""just a few more minutes"" and ended up playing for almost three hours. By the time I finished, she was understandably upset and had gone to bed without me.

The next day, she confronted me about it and said that I needed to reassess my priorities. I got defensive and told her that I was just trying to unwind and that she needed to be more understanding. I also mentioned that she could join me and play the game if she wanted, but she said she didn't enjoy gaming the way I do. I felt like she was trying to take away something that I enjoy, and I ended up saying some hurtful things.

Now, she’s been distant, and I feel like I didn’t do anything that wrong. AITA for prioritizing my gaming over my girlfriend's feelings and for not wanting to change my habits?",178,774,0.98,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_82419,2022-03-01 00:00:00,YTA,1764,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I (27f) recently started a new job and became friends with a few of my coworkers. They’re a really fun group, and we often go out for drinks after work. One of my coworkers, Sarah, is super nice and we really hit it off. She’s a bit chubby but has a great personality and is always the life of the party.

The other day, we were out for drinks and the conversation turned to fitness. I mentioned that I’ve been really dedicated to my workout routine and have lost some weight recently. Everyone was congratulating me, and I jokingly said something like, “I guess you could say I’m really working on my summer body, unlike some people here!” and pointed at Sarah with a laugh.

The room went silent, and I noticed that Sarah looked really uncomfortable. She tried to laugh it off, but I could tell it hurt her feelings. Some of my other coworkers started giving me side eyes, and one of them finally said, “That was a little harsh, don’t you think?”. I brushed it off, thinking they were being overly sensitive.

After a little while, Sarah excused herself to go to the bathroom, and as soon as she left, everyone started telling me I crossed a line. They said it was really rude of me to make fun of her weight, even if it was in a joking manner. I got defensive and said I was just being honest and that Sarah should lighten up.

When Sarah came back, the vibe was really off, and she seemed upset. I tried to apologize, but she said she needed some space and left the group early. Now, my coworkers are acting weird with me, and a couple of them have texted me saying I should really think about how my words affect others.

You're the Asshole,"I have a friend named Lisa who has been struggling with her mental health for a while. She's been open about her battle with anxiety and depression, and I've always tried to be supportive. Recently, she decided to start a book club to help herself feel more connected and to engage with others. She invited me to join, and I thought it might be a good way for both of us to spend more time together and get her to open up a bit.

The first meeting went well, and there was a good blend of people, but I quickly realized that the book choice was something I didn’t enjoy at all. I found myself dreading the discussions because I didn’t connect with the material. When the second book was announced, I was even less interested. 

Instead of just politely declining to participate, I decided to let Lisa know I wouldn't be attending any more meetings. I told her that I didn’t think the club was for me and that I didn’t want to waste her time if I wasn’t going to contribute positively. I may have come off a bit harsh, saying I didn't want to sit around discussing books I didn't like when I could be doing other things that I enjoyed more.

Lisa seemed hurt by my response, and I could tell it affected her. She expressed that she was hoping we could bond over this and that she really valued my opinion. But I defended my stance, insisting that I was doing it for my own well-being and that I didn’t want to be forced to read books I didn’t enjoy.

Now I’m starting to feel like maybe I was too blunt with her. I could have approached it differently or found a way to still support her without participating directly.

I’ve always been the one who achieved the most in our family—straight A’s, got a great job, and have traveled a lot. But now that she has her baby, it feels like everyone just wants to talk about her and the baby. 

So, during the family gathering to celebrate the baby’s first month, I decided to bring up my recent promotion at work. I thought it would be a good way to redirect some attention back to me. I started talking about my achievements and how hard I've worked to get where I am. At first, some family members engaged with me, but then I noticed my sister and her husband looking a bit uncomfortable. I didn’t really care, though—I felt like I deserved the spotlight too.

Eventually, my sister gently asked if we could focus on the baby since it was his special day, but I brushed her off and kept going. I thought I was just trying to share my success, but in hindsight, I realize it might have come off as insensitive.

We went to this nice restaurant and I treated her to a delicious meal. During dinner, she mentioned that she had applied for a few jobs but was feeling discouraged because no one had called her back yet. I thought I would help my friend out further and suggested that she could try asking some of her other friends if they knew of any openings.

As we were finishing up, Sarah casually mentioned that she was really looking forward to a concert coming up next week and that she wished she could afford to go. I jokingly said, ""Well, if you really want to go, just ask me for a ticket. I can get you one."" I really didn't mean it seriously, but Sarah took it to heart.

Later that night, she texted me asking if I could buy her a ticket. I thought she was joking, but she was completely serious. I told her that I couldn’t do that because I had other expenses and I didn't think it was right for me to just buy her a concert ticket when she's struggling financially. Her response was pretty upset, saying that I had offered and now I was going back on my word.

I maintained that it was just a joke and that I had no obligation to buy her anything. Now, she’s been distant with me, and I feel like I did the right thing by not giving in. I just wanted to help her but I can’t be responsible for her finances.

You're the Asshole,"So, I had this pretty significant milestone at work recently after putting in a lot of effort over the past couple of years. My boss decided to throw a small get-together at a nice restaurant to celebrate the team, which I really appreciated. However, during the dinner, I noticed that some of my colleagues were making comments about their meals, particularly about how great the food looked. 

As the night went on, I couldn't help but feel a little annoyed. I ordered a steak, and when it arrived, it was overcooked. I was really looking forward to this dinner, and I felt it was unacceptable that I received a steak that was not prepared the way I wanted. Instead of just quietly dealing with it, I made a big fuss about it. I raised my voice and called over the server in the middle of my boss’s speech, insisting that they take it back and remake it. I even went as far as to say that this was a special occasion and that I deserved to have my meal prepared properly.

The server was polite but explained that they were quite busy that night, and it might take a while to get a new one. But I didn't care—I told them I’d wait, and that I expected them to prioritize my order since I was celebrating my achievement. My colleagues looked uncomfortable, and I could see my boss frowning at my behavior, but I was too caught up in my own frustration to notice.

In the end, my steak was remade, and everyone else had finished their meals by the time mine arrived. My boss thanked everyone for coming, but I could tell that my outburst had put a damper on the evening. Afterward, a few colleagues mentioned that I should have handled it better, but I just brushed them off, thinking that I had every right to demand good service on a night meant to celebrate my success.

I have a younger sister (22F) who has always been really close to me and has been looking forward to my wedding day. However, she has been struggling with her mental health lately and has been very anxious about social situations.

A few weeks ago, I decided to pick my wedding party and told my sister that I wanted her to be my maid of honor. She was thrilled, but then I realized I wanted my best friend (31F) to be my maid of honor instead because we've been through a lot together and I felt she deserved that role more. So, I ended up asking my best friend and made my sister a bridesmaid.

When I told my sister, she was really hurt and disappointed. She started crying and said that she was feeling left out and that I didn’t appreciate her support. I tried to explain that it wasn’t about her, but I just felt more connected to my best friend in that role. Instead of comforting her, I got frustrated and told her to stop being so sensitive and that she needed to toughen up.

You're the Asshole,"My best friend, Sarah (30), has been in a committed relationship with her boyfriend, Mike (32), for about five years. They are living together and planning to get married. I've known Sarah for over a decade, and we often hang out together, so I feel pretty close to her.

Recently, I discovered that Mike had been in a serious relationship with another woman before he met Sarah. I accidentally stumbled upon some old photos of them together while scrolling through social media. I thought it was really important that Sarah knew about this, especially since they are planning to marry. I felt like she should have all the information before making such a big commitment.

So, one night when we were having dinner, I decided to bring it up. I said something along the lines of, ""Hey, I saw some old pictures of Mike with his ex, and I just thought you should know he was really serious with her before you guys got together."" I thought I was being a good friend by looking out for her.

Sarah's face dropped, and she looked really upset. She told me that Mike had shared his past with her and that they had talked about it openly. She felt like I was trying to create drama out of nothing and that it was inappropriate for me to bring it up, especially since it seemed like she had already processed it with Mike.

Instead of backing down, I insisted that I was just trying to help her make an informed decision. I argued that she deserved to know everything about the person she was planning to marry, even if it was in the past.

I mentioned that I wasn’t a fan of the texture of tofu, and that I missed the taste of real meat. Instead of being understanding, he got defensive and said I was being rude and dismissive of his lifestyle.

Last week, I decided to host a small get-together with some friends at our apartment. I invited a few people over to hang out and, of course, I wanted to show off my workout routine a bit. While everyone was enjoying snacks and chatting, I thought it would be a good idea to set up a little workout area in the living room. So, I moved some furniture around and started doing my exercises right in front of everyone.

I thought it would be fun and inspiring for my friends, but Sarah was understandably annoyed. She had planned to just relax and watch a movie, but instead, she had to deal with me jumping around and breathing heavily in her space. She asked me to stop because it was distracting, but I brushed her off, saying that I was just trying to motivate everyone to get fit.

You're the Asshole,"So, I recently found myself in a bit of a situation with my friend Jake. We've been friends for a long time, and he’s always been there for me. A few months ago, he confided in me about his struggles with anxiety and how he was trying to work through it. I really admired his courage for opening up to me, and I wanted to be supportive.

However, a couple of weeks ago, I found out that Jake was planning to propose to his girlfriend, Sarah. I thought it would be a great opportunity to give him a light-hearted nudge and maybe joke about it. So, in a group chat with a few friends, I brought it up and made a comment about how he better not mess it up, or he’ll be stuck single forever.

At first, everyone laughed, but then I noticed Jake wasn’t laughing. He seemed visibly upset, and I realized that my joke might have touched a nerve. Instead of apologizing or backing off, I doubled down, insisting that I was just trying to lighten the mood and that he had to be able to take a joke. I thought he was being overly sensitive, and I didn’t think my comment was that big of a deal.

A few days later, I found out that Jake had a panic attack after our conversation, and he’s been distant ever since. I reached out to him, but he hasn’t responded. Now, I feel guilty. I thought I was just being playful, but I guess I crossed a line.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for making a joke at my friend’s expense when he was already struggling?",541,1874,0.92,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_56772,2024-10-31 00:00:00,YTA,1438,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I (29M) have a younger sister, Mia (24F), who is a passionate animal rights activist. She’s been vegan for several years and often talks about how important it is to treat all animals with kindness and respect. I appreciate her commitment, but I don’t share the same level of enthusiasm. I’m a meat-eater, and while I respect her choices, I don’t think it’s a big deal to have different lifestyles.

Recently, Mia adopted a rescue dog named Charlie. He’s a sweet dog, but he has some behavioral issues stemming from his past. Mia has been working hard to train him and often shares updates with me. Last week, I invited Mia and Charlie over for dinner. I thought it would be nice to spend time together, but she insisted that I prepare a fully vegan meal. I was okay with it but got frustrated when she started lecturing me about how consuming meat is harmful to animals and the planet.

During dinner, I made a harmless joke about how I could never give up bacon. Mia immediately got upset and accused me of being insensitive to her beliefs and to Charlie’s past. I brushed it off, thinking she was overreacting, and tried to lighten the mood by offering to get Charlie a treat. I suggested some bacon-flavored dog treats I had seen at the store, but Mia sharply corrected me and said that I should only give him vegan treats. I laughed it off again, thinking she was being a bit extreme.

After dinner, I let Charlie outside to play while I cleaned up. I accidentally dropped a piece of the vegan meal on the ground, and Charlie snatched it up before I could stop him. Mia came rushing outside, panicking, and I jokingly said, “Relax, it’s just vegan food; he’ll be fine!” She lost it and yelled at me for being careless and not taking Charlie’s health into consideration. I told her she was being dramatic and that it was just a little food, but she stormed off, upset.

Now I’m reflecting on whether I overstepped or was too dismissive of her concerns for Charlie. AITA for joking about my eating habits and not taking Mia’s dog’s diet seriously?",74,1437,0.58,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_22398,2023-11-01 00:00:00,YTA,2050,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I've been friends with Sarah for several years, and she’s always been there for me during tough times. Recently, she started dating a guy named Mike, and while I met him a few times, I never really clicked with him. He's nice enough, but he can be a bit arrogant and has a tendency to dominate conversations, often cutting people off.

Last month, Sarah invited me to a birthday dinner for Mike at a restaurant. I thought it would be a nice opportunity to support her and hopefully get to know him better. However, during the dinner, Mike started bragging about his job and how much money he makes. He went on and on, and it became pretty uncomfortable. I tried to change the subject a couple of times, but he just kept talking about himself.

At one point, I jokingly said, “Wow, I didn’t realize we were here for a Mike Appreciation Night!” I thought it would lighten the mood, but instead, it fell flat. Mike shot me a glare, and Sarah looked visibly uncomfortable. I brushed it off, thinking it was just a joke among friends.

After dinner, Sarah and I were walking to the car when she told me she didn’t appreciate my comment. She said I embarrassed Mike in front of everyone and that I should have been more supportive of her relationship. I thought she was overreacting, but I apologized anyway. I didn’t think my comment was that big of a deal, so I expressed that I was just trying to make a joke.

A few days later, Sarah called me and said that Mike was upset and that I should reach out to him and apologize directly. I told her I didn’t think I needed to apologize to him since I didn’t intend to hurt anyone, but she insisted that I was being disrespectful. I eventually texted Mike, trying to smooth things over, but he didn’t respond.

You're the Asshole,"So, I (28F) recently had a big birthday party to celebrate turning 30. I was really excited about it because I wanted to make it a memorable occasion. I invited a bunch of friends and family, and I planned it at a nice restaurant that I love. The catch was that I decided to keep it a strictly no kids event. I’ve always found that adult gatherings are much more relaxed and enjoyable without children running around.

One of my closest friends, Sarah (also 28), has a two-year-old son. When I sent out the invitations, I specifically mentioned that the party would be for adults only. Sarah initially seemed okay with it, but then she brought it up again a few days before the party, saying she was struggling to find a babysitter. She asked if she could bring her son just for the dinner and then leave early. I told her that I really wanted to keep the event kid-free and that I thought it would be best if she found someone to watch him.

When the day of the party arrived, Sarah showed up without her son, but she was clearly upset about it. During the party, while everyone was having a great time chatting and enjoying themselves, Sarah kept making little comments about how it felt weird to exclude kids and how it was unfair that her son didn’t get to join. I brushed it off, thinking she would get over it, but she continued to complain to me about how difficult it was to find a sitter and how she missed her son.

In a moment of frustration, I snapped at her and said something like, ""Well, not everything is about kids, Sarah. This is my party, and I want it to be an adult celebration."" She went quiet after that, and I felt a bit guilty, but I also felt justified because it was my birthday and my choice. After the party, Sarah texted me telling me she was disappointed in how I handled it and that it felt like I didn’t care about her as a friend.

So, AITA for wanting a kid-free birthday party and for how I handled Sarah’s complaints?",956,1149,0.67,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_94955,2022-03-26 00:00:00,YTA,1954,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I feel like I might be the asshole here, but let me explain.

I (35M) have a cousin, Sarah (22F), who recently graduated college and moved back in with her parents. She’s been struggling to find a job and is feeling a bit lost, which I completely understand. However, I have a bit of a history with Sarah that makes me uneasy about her staying with us.

When we were younger, Sarah was always very dramatic, and she had this tendency to exaggerate situations for attention. There was a time when she claimed she was being bullied in school, and we all rallied around her, only to find out later that she had been the instigator. It made me wary of her stories. 

Recently, she reached out and asked if she could stay at my place for a while because it was tough at home. I agreed, thinking it would help her get back on her feet. But after she moved in, I started to notice some concerning behaviors. For example, she would leave the house for long periods without telling me where she was going, and she seemed to be hanging out with some questionable people. 

One night, she came home very late, and I could smell alcohol on her. I confronted her about it, and she just laughed it off, saying I was being overprotective. I couldn’t help but feel that she was just like she was when we were younger—seeking attention and not taking life seriously.

So, last weekend, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I told her that I’d be installing a tracking app on her phone so I could keep an eye on her whereabouts. She was furious and called me controlling and invasive. I told her that I was just looking out for her and that I couldn't trust her judgment based on her past.

Now she’s refusing to talk to me and has been looking for other places to stay. My family is divided on this, with some saying I was right to be concerned and others feeling like I crossed a line. 

I really wanted to help her, but now I feel like I might have pushed her away. AITA for installing the tracking app and trying to keep her safe?",359,1513,0.66,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_52761,2024-03-13 00:00:00,YTA,2024,AITA
You're the Asshole,"Throwaway account for privacy. 

So I’ve been living with my girlfriend, let’s call her M, for about a year now. Things have been mostly good, but we’ve definitely had our ups and downs. Recently, I started hanging out with a coworker, whom I’ll refer to as T, and I just feel like we have such a strong connection.

T is smart, funny, and we share a lot of interests. Unlike M, who sometimes feels distant and not as invested in our relationship, T makes me feel alive and excited about life. We’ve been going out for drinks after work and have even kissed a few times. I know it’s wrong, but I can’t help it; I feel like T is my soulmate.

M has no idea about my feelings for T, and I keep telling myself that I’ll break up with M before things go any further with T. But honestly, I just can’t bring myself to do it. I feel guilty because M has been supportive and caring throughout our time together. I know I should just end things, but I’m scared of hurting her and the consequences it might have on our living situation.

I’ve been thinking about telling M that I need space to figure things out, which would basically be my way of breaking up without directly addressing the whole T situation. I know that sounds awful, but I just want to explore my feelings for T without feeling like a complete jerk. 

So, AITA for wanting to end things with M while I pursue something with T, but not being honest with M about it?

You're the Asshole,"This happened a few months ago, and I’ve been feeling conflicted about whether I was in the wrong, so I figured I’d share and see what people think.

My best friend, Sarah, has been dating her boyfriend, Mike, for about two years. They have a pretty solid relationship, but I’ve always had my doubts about him. He just seems a bit shady to me. Sarah has always dismissed my concerns, saying that I don’t know him like she does and that I should trust her judgment.

Well, a month ago, I overheard a conversation between Mike and one of his friends while I was at Sarah’s place. They were talking about money and how Mike had been borrowing quite a bit from various people, including some shady characters. It made my stomach turn, and I immediately thought about how worried Sarah would be if she knew. 

Instead of talking to Sarah directly about my concerns, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I texted her and told her that I had some “important” news about Mike that she needed to hear. When she asked what it was, I didn’t tell her the whole truth. I wanted to make sure she was fully alert during our conversation, so I downplayed it and just said I'd prefer to talk in person. I didn’t want to ruin her day with a text; I felt it was better to have a serious face-to-face discussion.

When we met up, I went into detail about what I overheard. Instead of being understanding, she got really defensive. She accused me of trying to break them up and insisted that I'm just jealous of her relationship. In the heat of the moment, I let slip that I've always thought he was bad news and that I never really supported their relationship. 

This led to a huge argument, and Sarah ended up saying that she needed time away from me. I felt awful afterward because I never intended to come off as jealous or controlling. I just wanted to protect her. Now, she’s barely talking to me, and I feel like I've lost not just my friendship with her but also a chance to help her.

I see a lot of people saying that you should always be honest with your friends, but I can’t shake the feeling that I messed up. I let my worries about Mike spiral out of control and ended up hurting my friend.

You're the Asshole,"My (30M) friends and I have a tradition of going on a weekend trip every summer. This year, we rented a cabin in the mountains, and I was really looking forward to it. There are five of us in total: me, my best friend Mike (30M), Sarah (29F), Jake (31M), and Emily (28F).

When we got to the cabin, I noticed that the sleeping arrangements were a bit cramped. There were two bedrooms, but one had a queen bed and the other had a bunk bed. I assumed Mike and I would take the bunk beds since we’re both guys, and the girls would share the queen, but Mike suggested I share the queen bed with Sarah because he thought it would be more comfortable for the girls. I didn't think it was fair, but I went along with it.

Later that night, we were all playing games and drinking. I started to feel jealous of Sarah and Mike because they were getting really close and laughing together. It made me uncomfortable, so I decided to make a sarcastic comment. I said, “Wow, Sarah, you’re really cozy with Mike there. Should I be worried?” Everyone laughed, but I could see that Sarah looked a little hurt.

She brushed it off, but I continued to make little comments throughout the night, thinking I was just being funny. At one point, Jake pulled me aside and told me I was being a jerk and that I should stop trying to make things awkward. I blew him off, saying it was just a joke.

The next morning, I woke up to find that Sarah had left the cabin to stay with her parents instead of spending the weekend with us. I was confused and tried to call her, but she didn’t answer. Later, I texted her to apologize for my comments, but she told me that I had ruined the trip for her and that I needed to reflect on how I treat my friends.

You're the Asshole,"I (29F) have a little brother (15M) who is a huge gamer. He's been really into video games since he was about five, and he’s gotten pretty good at them. Recently, he entered a local gaming tournament, and I was super excited for him. I’ve always supported his passion, and I think it’s great that he has something he loves.

However, he’s gotten a bit obsessed with practicing lately. He spends hours every day on his console, and while I understand that dedication is important, I’ve noticed he’s neglecting his schoolwork. His grades have been slipping, and he's been getting frustrated with himself when he doesn’t do well in school. I could tell he was feeling overwhelmed, and I wanted to help him find a balance.

So, I thought it would be a good idea to take matters into my own hands. I started limiting his gaming time without consulting him. I told him he could only play for two hours a day on school nights and three hours on weekends. I set a timer, and when the timer went off, I would turn off the console myself. I thought I was just helping him focus on his studies and encouraging him to take breaks, but he was really upset about it.

When he tried to talk to me about how it made him feel, I brushed him off, thinking I knew what was best for him. I told him that his education was far more important than any game and that he would thank me later for this. I honestly thought I was being a good big sister by making sure he didn’t waste his potential.

His friends started noticing he wasn’t around to play online with them anymore, and it led to some tension between us. Last week, he confronted me and said I was ruining his enjoyment of gaming and that he felt like I didn’t believe in him. I got defensive and told him that he was just being lazy and didn’t understand how important it was to have a good future.

I later vented about it to a group chat with some friends, and they told me I was being too controlling and should have discussed it with him first instead of just imposing rules.

You're the Asshole,"Today, I attended a birthday party for my friend’s son, who is turning five. The party was at a local park, and there were a lot of kids and parents there. I brought my two kids with me, and they were really excited to join in on the games and activities.

One of the games was a piñata, and all the kids were eagerly waiting for their turn. When it was time for my son to have a go, he was super excited and swung the bat, but he missed. Then, another kid, who was a bit older, stepped up and managed to break the piñata on his turn. The kids scrambled to collect the candy, and my son was really disappointed that he didn’t get as much as he wanted.

After the piñata was done, I noticed that the older kid had a big bag of candy he had gathered. I approached the boy’s parents and asked if they could share some of the candy with my son since he didn't get much from the piñata. The parents looked surprised and politely declined, explaining that their son had worked hard to collect that candy and they wanted him to enjoy it.

I felt embarrassed and frustrated. I turned to my son and told him, “Don’t worry, just ask for some from him!” My son, being only four and not fully understanding social cues, walked over and asked the older boy for some candy. The boy looked confused and said no. I could see the disappointment on my son’s face, and honestly, I was annoyed.

Instead of just letting it go, I raised my voice a bit and said, “Come on, he can share. There’s enough for everyone!” At this point, the other parents were staring at me, and I could see the older boy’s parents exchanging uncomfortable glances. They politely stood their ground, telling me that sharing is nice but it’s not required.

My husband later told me I was crossing a line and that I shouldn’t have pressured the kids or their parents. He thinks I was out of line because it wasn’t fair to put that expectation on the other child. I still feel like I was just advocating for my son, but now I’m wondering if I went too far.

You're the Asshole,"Some background: I’ve been friends with Sarah for several years, and we often hang out and support each other’s interests. Recently, Sarah started a new fitness journey and has been posting about it on social media. She’s been very enthusiastic and has been encouraging her friends to join her in various workouts and challenges.

About a month ago, Sarah invited me to join her in a fitness challenge that she was really excited about. I was hesitant because I’ve never been into fitness, and I find it hard to stay motivated. However, I didn’t want to hurt her feelings, so I said I would think about it.

As the weeks went by, I kept making excuses for not participating. I told her I was too busy with work, or that I was feeling unwell. Meanwhile, I started going out with some friends on weekends and indulging in food and drinks, which I know Sarah would disapprove of. I didn’t want to hear her judgments about my lifestyle, so I just kept avoiding the topic.

Last week, I saw Sarah’s post about completing the fitness challenge, and she was so proud of herself. She tagged me in her post and mentioned how she wished I had joined her, saying it would have been great for us to do it together. I felt really guilty about not participating, so I tried to downplay it and joked that I was going through a ""fitness hiatus.""

A couple of days later, Sarah asked me if I wanted to join her for a workout session. I brushed it off again, saying I had plans, which wasn’t true. I just didn't want to go through the hassle of feeling judged while I was out of shape and not committed to fitness.

When she confronted me about it later, I got defensive and told her she needed to stop pushing her fitness goals onto others. I said it wasn’t fair for her to expect everyone to be as passionate as she was. She seemed hurt and pointed out that she was just trying to be supportive.

Looking back, I realize I could have been more honest and supportive of her journey instead of avoiding her. I didn’t intend to make her feel bad, but I probably came off as dismissive.

I know my friends love pizza, so I ordered a variety of pizzas, wings, and sides. My best friend, Jamie, is vegan, so I thought it would be nice to order a couple of vegan pizzas for her.

A few days before the party, Jamie told me she was really excited and that she’d bring her famous vegan dessert. I was thrilled because her desserts are always a hit. The day of the party, I went all out with decorations and set up a great playlist with our favorite songs.

When Jamie arrived, she brought her dessert and I was so happy to see it. But when I was serving the food, I realized I had forgotten to order any salads or other vegan sides apart from the pizzas. I thought the vegan pizzas would be enough, and I assumed everyone would be too busy enjoying the pizza to notice.

As the party went on, I noticed Jamie looking a bit uncomfortable. She didn’t say anything at first, but then she pulled me aside and told me she felt really left out. She mentioned that she had expected there to be more options for her to eat and was disappointed that there were only two pizzas. I shrugged it off and told her that the pizzas were delicious and that she should just eat those.

Jamie then pointed out that I hadn't really considered her dietary needs while planning the party. I got defensive and told her that it was my birthday and I wanted to have the food that I liked. I felt like she was being overly sensitive, especially since I had made an effort to get her vegan pizzas. I reminded her that I had invited her and that she should be grateful for that.

Recently, Jake got engaged to his long-time girlfriend, and I was genuinely happy for him. However, when he asked me to be his best man, I was taken aback. I didn't think I would be a good fit for the role, but I didn't want to let him down, so I reluctantly agreed.

The wedding planning started, and I quickly realized that I was expected to contribute a lot more than just showing up. Jake wanted me to help organize the bachelor party, which I had no interest in planning. I'm not really into partying, and I didn't want to spend a ton of money on it either. So, when Jake was discussing potential ideas, I started making snide comments about how ridiculous they sounded and how I thought the whole thing was a waste of time.

Things escalated when I started to criticize other aspects of the wedding planning. I made a joke about how I thought his choice of venue was tacky, and I openly questioned his choice of music for the ceremony. Jake seemed hurt, but I brushed it off, thinking he was just being overly sensitive.

I canceled on a few meetings and didn’t contribute to the group chat where everyone was discussing arrangements.

My friends often joke that I have a “no-filter” personality, and I’ve always thought that being candid is what makes me relatable and fun. But I’ve been told I sometimes take it too far.

Last week, I attended a birthday party for one of my closest friends. The atmosphere was great, everyone was having a good time, and there was plenty of food and drinks. The birthday girl is known for being a little more on the sensitive side, so I decided to make a few jokes at her expense—nothing too harsh, just playful teasing about her love for cats and how her apartment is basically a cat sanctuary.

As the night went on, I could see her becoming quieter and more withdrawn. I thought it was just her being bashful, so I ramped up my jokes, thinking I was being funny and entertaining. I even made a comment about how she’d probably end up alone with her cats, which got a few laughs from others but made her visibly upset.

I realized something was off when she excused herself to go to the bathroom and didn’t come back for a while.

You're the Asshole,"Warning: this is a bit long. I'm on mobile.

TLDR at the bottom.

Background: I work in tech and recently landed a job at a well-known company. My family always struggled financially, and I’m the first in my family to graduate college. I’ve been trying to help my parents out ever since I started earning a decent income by paying for their groceries and helping with bills.

However, I have a close friend, Jake, who has always had a different perspective on money. He tends to spend extravagantly, often on himself. While I’ve always been supportive of him, I sometimes feel like he expects me to treat him since I’m doing well now.

A couple of weeks ago, we went out to eat, and I casually offered to cover the bill since I’ve been doing well and I thought it’d be nice. Jake seemed surprised and said, “Wow, it’s about time you started treating me! I’ve always been there for you, and now that you’re making it, it’s your turn to return the favor.”

At first, I laughed it off, but the more I thought about it, the more it bothered me. I started feeling like he was viewing our friendship as a transaction instead of a genuine relationship. I mentioned this to some other friends, and they seemed to agree that Jake was being a bit entitled. 

Then, last weekend, Jake invited me to a concert that I’ve been looking forward to for months. When I said I’d love to go, he casually mentioned that I should buy the tickets since I’m “doing so well now.” I couldn’t believe it. I felt used and hurt that he thinks I should just shell out money for him because I have a stable job.

I decided to confront him about it. I told him that I felt like he was being entitled and that I don’t see our friendship as something where I owe him for the times he supported me. He got really defensive and said I was being ungrateful for all he’s done for me over the years. He claimed that he always just wanted to help me, but now that I’m in a better place, it’s only fair I help him back. 

I told him that just because I’m making more money doesn’t mean I should be expected to pay for everything or owe him for past favors. I argued that true friendship shouldn’t come with strings attached. He ended up really upset, and now we aren't talking. I can't help but feel like I might have overreacted, but I also think I stood my ground.

You're the Asshole,"Last week, I hosted a birthday party for my daughter, who just turned 7. I invited a lot of her friends and, of course, their parents. Everything was going smoothly until it was time for cake. I decided to get a little creative and ordered a cake that had a colorful design featuring her favorite cartoon characters, but I also told the bakery to add some small, edible glitter on top.

When the cake arrived, I thought it looked amazing, but then one of the parents, who was very health-conscious, took one look at it and immediately started criticizing my choice. She said it was inappropriate to have glitter on a cake because it could confuse kids about what is safe to eat. I shrugged it off, thinking she was overreacting, and invited everyone to enjoy the cake.

As the kids started digging in, she kept going on about how I should have known better and that her son wasn’t allowed to have anything with artificial ingredients. I told her that it was just a bit of edible glitter and that it wouldn’t hurt anyone. I felt like she was ruining the fun, so I sarcastically suggested that maybe she should just take her kid home if he couldn’t handle it.

Eventually, the party ended, and I later received a message from her saying that I was inconsiderate and that I could have hurt her son by exposing him to things he isn't allowed to eat. I felt a bit guilty but also thought she was overreacting. I mean, it’s just cake! Am I the asshole for wanting to have a fun birthday party for my daughter, or was she being too uptight about the glitter?",489,1179,0.62,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_43185,2019-09-19 00:00:00,YTA,1551,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I’m really torn about a situation that happened with my sister recently, and I’m not sure if I handled it the right way.

So, a bit of background: my sister has been in a pretty serious relationship for a couple of years now. I’ve always liked her boyfriend, but I thought they were taking things a little slow. Last month, she told me he proposed and they’re getting married in a few months. I was really happy for her, but I also jokingly said, “Wow, you guys are moving fast!” She laughed it off, but I could tell she was a bit defensive.

Fast forward to the engagement party. It was a nice gathering, and everyone was excited. During my speech, I made a joke about her being a “runaway bride” because of how quickly everything was happening. I thought it was lighthearted, but her face dropped, and it became awkward. I quickly tried to shift the mood, but I could feel the tension in the room.

Later, she pulled me aside and told me I was ruining her special day with my jokes. I got defensive and told her that she was being overly sensitive; I meant it as a compliment that she found someone she wants to marry. I also reminded her that family gatherings are supposed to be fun and lighthearted. We ended up having a heated argument, and she left the party in tears.

Now, I feel really bad about it, but I also think she might be overreacting. I’ve always joked with her, and I didn’t mean any harm. A few family members mentioned that I should have kept my jokes to myself, but I didn’t think it was that big of a deal.

She’s been planning this big wedding for a year, and it’s supposed to be really fancy, which is what she wants. The thing is, she’s also been struggling financially, and I know she’s relying on our parents to help fund most of it. 

A week ago, she called me to share her ideas and excitement, and as she was talking, I couldn't help but express my concern. I suggested that maybe she should consider a smaller, more intimate wedding instead of the extravagant one she was planning, especially given her financial situation. I mentioned that it might be more practical to save money for their future instead of spending it all on one day. 

She got really upset and accused me of ruining her excitement and being unsupportive. I tried to explain that I only wanted what was best for her, but it seemed to really hurt her feelings. She even said I was being controlling and that she should be able to have the wedding she wants without me judging her decisions.

I understand that it’s her wedding and she should be able to do what makes her happy, but I just feel like I was trying to help her see the bigger picture. Now, she’s not talking to me, and my parents are caught in the middle, saying I should have kept my opinions to myself.

You're the Asshole,"So, I have a bit of a situation that happened with my friend group, and I'm curious to see if I'm in the wrong here. 

I (30M) have a close-knit group of friends that I’ve known since college. We all used to hang out all the time, but as we've gotten older and more responsibilities have cropped up, we don’t see each other as often. Recently, we decided to have a game night at my place, which I was really looking forward to.

Now, one of my friends, Alex (30M), has been dating someone (let’s call her Jamie, 28F) for about six months. I didn’t know her well, but I said sure, she could join us for game night. I was a little apprehensive because I knew that sometimes new partners can change the dynamic of a group, but I figured it would be fine.

When Jamie arrived, she seemed nice but immediately took over the conversation. It was all about her interests, her hobbies, and even what she thought about our favorite games. At first, I was patient, but as the night went on, it became clear that she wasn’t interested in any of our usual banter or the games we liked. She was more focused on dominating the conversation and I could see my friends getting uncomfortable.

At one point, I made a joke that I thought would lighten the mood, but Jamie didn’t get it and instead rolled her eyes. I felt embarrassed and frustrated. So, in a moment of irritation, I said, “Hey, it’s game night, not Jamie's personal talk show!” I thought it would bring her back into the group, but instead, it just made the atmosphere really tense.

Alex got visibly upset and told me I was being rude to his girlfriend. I tried to explain that I was just trying to keep the vibe fun, but he didn’t want to hear it. I ended up apologizing to Jamie, but the rest of the night felt awkward, and I could see my friends were caught in the middle.

Afterward, Alex sent me a message saying he was disappointed in how I handled things and that I should’ve been more welcoming. While I did apologize, I still feel like I was just trying to protect our group dynamic. Now I'm wondering if I overreacted. Was I the asshole for calling her out in front of everyone?

You're the Asshole,"Throwaway.

My brother, who's 28, has a dog named Max that he got when he was in college. Max has always been his baby, and they share a strong bond. About a year ago, my brother had to move in with me temporarily due to some financial issues. He brought Max with him, and I was fine with it at first, but I quickly realized that Max was a handful. 

I have a small apartment, and Max is a hyperactive dog who loves to chew on everything. He destroyed my couch and a couple of my shoes, which really pissed me off. I tried to train him and set boundaries, but it was difficult because my brother would constantly give in to his demands and let him do whatever he wanted. 

Last month, my brother went on a weekend trip, and I was left to take care of Max. I was at my wit's end with him. He was barking constantly, and he chewed up my favorite blanket. In a moment of frustration, I decided to take him to a shelter. I thought it would be better for both of us since I couldn't handle him anymore.

When my brother came back and found out, he was absolutely devastated. He called me a terrible person and hasn't spoken to me since. I honestly thought I was doing the right thing at the time.

Recently, I organized a small gathering with some mutual friends to celebrate my birthday. I really wanted to make it special, but I also wanted to be inclusive of everyone’s comfort levels. I invited Sarah, but I made it clear in the group chat that I wanted the gathering to be a fun, upbeat celebration with games, music, and a lot of energy.

When the day came, Sarah texted me to say she was feeling particularly down and didn’t think she could make it. I understood, but in the moment, I felt frustrated because I really wanted her there. Instead of offering my support, I snapped and told her that she was ruining my birthday by not coming. I said that it was important for her to come out and have fun, even if she didn’t feel like it, and that she needed to push herself more.

She ended up not coming and I spent the night feeling guilty about what I said. A few of our friends reached out to ask about Sarah, and it became obvious that my comments had upset her.

Here's where the issue started. I invited my friend Jake, who had been with me through thick and thin, to come celebrate my new car. When he arrived, I was super excited to show him. But when I unveiled it, he looked stunned and then sort of frowned.

Jake said, ""Wow, that's a bit much, isn't it? I mean, you could have gotten something more practical."" 

I shrugged it off and said, ""It's my money, I can spend it how I want. I worked hard for this.""

He then mentioned how he had been saving up for a reliable used car and was frustrated because it felt like I was showing off. I told him that if he was upset about it, that was his problem, not mine. 

Later, I overheard him telling another friend that he thought my purchase was excessive and that I was rubbing it in his face. I felt hurt because I just wanted to celebrate my success with him, but now I was left feeling guilty for my choice.

Jake has recently become really interested in gaming. He loves playing with his friends online, and it seems to help him feel more connected and relaxed. I generally support his interests, but I have always emphasized the importance of balance and making sure he doesn’t spend all his time in front of a screen.

Recently, he was invited to join a competitive gaming team. He was over the moon and excited about the opportunity. I was initially supportive but started to worry when I realized the commitment involved. The team practices several times a week and has tournaments almost every weekend. I didn’t want him to feel overwhelmed or neglect his schoolwork.

So, I had a conversation with him and told him I thought it would be better if he didn’t join the team. I mentioned that he should focus on school and other activities that could benefit his mental health, like going outside or spending time with friends in person. I tried to frame it as me just looking out for him, but I could see he was really disappointed.

Now, my wife (36F) is on Jake’s side and thinks I overstepped. She believes this is a chance for Jake to build confidence and friendships.

You're the Asshole,"So, I recently had a birthday party for my 10-year-old son. I invited his friends from school, and we had a great time with games, cake, and all the usual birthday fun. However, I decided to keep the party small and only invite a select few kids—around six of his closest friends. My son has been quite anxious lately, and I thought a smaller group would help him feel more comfortable and allow him to really enjoy the day without being overwhelmed.

The problem started when I received a text from one of the kids' parents, asking why their child wasn’t invited. I just responded that I wanted to keep the party small this year, which apparently didn’t sit well with them. The parent went on to say that this child often feels left out at school, and I should have considered that when making the guest list. 

Feeling guilty, I decided to send out a last-minute invitation to this kid, even though the party was already planned and set up. When the kid arrived, he didn’t know anyone else there and was clearly uncomfortable. Rather than focus on my son and his friends, I spent a lot of time trying to include this kid, which upset my son. He ended up feeling overshadowed and didn't enjoy his own party.

After the party, I realized that maybe I should have just stuck to my original plan and prioritized my son's comfort instead of trying to please everyone.

Sarah has been struggling financially for a while now, and I know she’s been trying to save up for a car. However, she always seems to find herself in situations where she spends her money on things she doesn't really need. 

During our trip, we went to a local bar for some drinks. Sarah was really excited but mentioned that she only had enough for a couple of drinks and needed to be careful. I knew she had some past issues with impulse spending, but I didn't think much of it at the time. 

When we got to the bar, Sarah started ordering rounds for everyone, and I could see her running low on cash. I tried to remind her about her budget, but she brushed me off, saying she wanted everyone to have a good time. I didn’t want to ruin the fun, so I kept quiet. 

As the night went on, I noticed Sarah was getting a bit too tipsy, and she started playing games at the bar that cost money. I watched her spend her last few dollars on those games, and I could see the regret on her face as she realized she had no cash left for the rest of the weekend. 

The next day, she was upset and told me she was really disappointed in herself for spending all her money. I felt a bit guilty since I didn’t stop her, but I convinced myself that she’s an adult who can make her own choices. 

Later that day, I found out that Sarah had borrowed some money to buy a round of drinks for everyone again, and I could see she was already stressed about paying it back.

It was about $150, and I thought it was a thoughtful gift and something that they could use regularly. I wrapped it up nicely and brought it to the shower, feeling quite proud of my choice.

When I got there, I noticed that most people were giving cash gifts. My cousin opened my gift and seemed a bit taken aback. She thanked me politely but then mentioned that they had specifically requested cash to help out with their expenses. I could tell she was disappointed, and it made me feel a bit awkward.

Later on, some family members commented on how they appreciated that my cousin wanted cash to avoid cluttering their home with unnecessary items. It made me realize that maybe I had done the wrong thing by disregarding their wishes. 

I justified my actions by thinking that I knew better and wanted to give something special, but now I’m wondering if I should have just followed their request instead.

You're the Asshole,"So, I (35M) have a really close group of friends, we’ve been together since college. We always plan a big trip every summer, and this year we decided to go to a beach resort. Everyone was super excited, and we all agreed to split the costs evenly.

One of my friends, Jake (34M), recently got engaged and has been trying to save money for the wedding. Knowing this, I offered to let him pay a smaller share for the trip since I could afford it. He was really appreciative and said it would help him a lot. We all agreed on the split, and I felt good about helping him out.

The trip was amazing, and everyone had a blast. However, a few days in, I noticed that Jake wasn’t participating in many activities and seemed to be a bit distant. When I asked him if he was okay, he mentioned that money was tighter than he thought and he was stressed about it.

Feeling a little annoyed that I had lowered his trip cost and he was still worried, I decided to confront him. I told him that since I was already helping him out, he should just relax and enjoy the vacation instead of worrying about money. I also pointed out that he shouldn't have come if he couldn’t afford it. Things got heated, and I ended up telling him that he was being ungrateful for the help I offered.

After that, the atmosphere changed, and Jake didn’t talk to me much for the rest of the trip. I felt justified in my actions, but now I’m starting to wonder if I was too harsh. A few of our other friends sided with him and said I should have been more understanding of his situation.

So, I've been friends with this guy, Jake, for a few years now. We're pretty close and hang out often. Recently, Jake started dating someone new, let's call her Sarah. I've met Sarah a couple of times, and she seems nice enough.

A few nights ago, we were all hanging out at my place, just watching movies. At one point, I was trying to lighten the mood with some jokes. I made a comment about how Sarah looked a bit like a cartoon character when she laughed, specifically how her smile reminded me of one of the characters from a popular kids' show. I thought it was funny and good-natured, but the moment I said it, Sarah went quiet and looked really upset.

Jake immediately jumped in, defending her, saying it was rude and that I should apologize. I thought they were overreacting, but I said I was sorry if I hurt her feelings. Sarah didn't respond, and the atmosphere in the room grew awkward. Eventually, she left early, and Jake was clearly upset with me.

The next day, I texted Jake to check in, and he told me Sarah didn't want to hang out with me again because she felt self-conscious about my comment. I was frustrated and told him that I didn’t mean any harm and it was just a joke. He said that I should have been more considerate and that I crossed a line.

Leading up to the big day, she was super stressed about planning everything, and I tried to help out as much as I could. However, I also wanted to make sure to stand out and shine at the wedding since it was a big event. 

The day before the wedding, she finally confirmed her dress and told us to wear something light pink or pastel. I already had a dress I loved, but it was more of a hot pink. I thought it was close enough and decided to wear it anyway because it made me feel amazing. I figured she wouldn’t really mind because she was so busy with other things.

On the wedding day, I showed up in my hot pink dress, and at first, she seemed a bit taken aback but didn’t say anything. During the ceremony, I could see her glance at me a few times. After the ceremony, as we were getting ready for photos, she pulled me aside and said, “You know, I really wanted everyone to look coordinated. The hot pink is really distracting.” 

I brushed it off and said, “Oh come on, it’s just a bit of color. Everyone will be focused on you, not me.” I thought I was being supportive because I was there for her, right? 

Later, during the reception, I saw her talking to another bridesmaid, and they both looked over at me and shook their heads. It made me feel like I was being judged. I thought about it and decided to have a little fun with it, so I started posing for pictures in silly ways, laughing, and trying to be the life of the party.

At the end of the night, my friend looked really upset and told me that I had made her wedding day all about me instead of her. I still didn’t see what the big deal was. I mean, I was just trying to enjoy myself! She ended up crying, and I just felt frustrated because I thought she was overreacting. 

So now I'm wondering, AITA for wearing the dress I wanted and trying to have a good time at my friend’s wedding?

Last week, I went into his room while he was out and took his gaming console. I hid it in my room and told him that I had “borrowed” it to prevent him from playing so late at night. I explained to him that it was for his own good and that he needed to focus on his mental health instead. 

He was really upset when he found out, and I could see how much it hurt him. He told me I was being controlling and that he felt like I didn’t trust him to manage his own time. But I just wanted to help him! I thought that by removing the console, he would be forced to find healthier hobbies and sleep better.

I had made plans to go out with another group of friends that night, and while I felt guilty about possibly letting her down, I didn’t want to cancel my plans. I decided to send her a text that simply said, “I can’t tonight; I have plans with other friends.” I thought it was straightforward, but she responded with a very emotional message, expressing how alone she felt and how she really needed me.

Instead of being understanding, I got frustrated and replied, “You can’t always depend on me to be your emotional support. You need to find a therapist or something.” I felt like I was being honest, but looking back, I realize I could have been more compassionate in my response.

She didn’t reply, and I later found out that she felt hurt and abandoned.

Recently, my girlfriend mentioned that she would really appreciate it if I asked her mother for her blessing before I propose. I immediately dismissed the idea.

I figured it would be a nice surprise, and I was confident that my girlfriend would love it. So, I planned a romantic evening and popped the question.

I found out that she was really proud of one of her paintings and wanted to hang it in the living room. However, I didn’t think it was good enough for our home decor. Honestly, I’m very particular about aesthetics, and I want our house to look more sophisticated and put together. 

So, instead of encouraging her, I brushed it off and told her that maybe she could keep it in her room, but I didn’t want it displayed where guests could see it. I suggested that if she wanted to paint something more “adult” or “refined,” then I would consider hanging it up. She looked really disappointed, but I felt like I was doing what was best for the house.

A few days later, I found out that my husband had secretly framed her painting and hung it in our hallway. I was furious when I saw it and told him that he had undermined my decision. I argued with him and insisted that we should have a more cohesive look in our home and that it was important for our daughter to understand that not everything she creates is worthy of being displayed.

I wanted to make a good impression on the client and show that our team is professional.

Eventually, we ended up dancing together, and I made a couple of slightly suggestive comments. I didn’t mean anything serious by it; I thought it was just playful banter. 

As the night progressed, we ended up sharing a kiss. In that moment, I wasn't thinking about my girlfriend at all. I know it was a mistake, and I immediately regretted it once I realized what I had done. I tried to brush it off as just a silly mistake, and I told my friend it wouldn’t happen again. 

When I got home, I knew I had to tell my girlfriend what happened. She was devastated and understandably angry. I tried to explain that it was just a moment of weakness and that I never intended to hurt her. I told her I still loved her and didn't want to lose her. 

However, she said I violated her trust and that what I did was unacceptable. Now, she’s considering breaking up with me, and I feel really lost. My friends have been telling me that it was just a mistake and that I shouldn’t be too hard on myself, but I can’t shake the feeling that I messed up badly.

So, AITA for kissing my old friend at my buddy's wedding, even though I didn't mean for it to happen?

You're the Asshole,"I think I might be the asshole here, and I wanted to get some outside perspective.

So, I have a close friend, Sarah, who recently started a new job. She was really excited about it and wanted to celebrate her first week with a small get-together at her place. Sarah invited a few of our mutual friends, and I was one of the first to RSVP. I thought it would be a nice way to show my support and celebrate her accomplishment.

The day of the get-together, I found out that Sarah was going to cook dinner for everyone. She asked each of us to bring a dish to share, which I thought was a great idea. However, I was feeling a bit lazy and didn’t want to cook anything elaborate. I had some leftover takeout from a restaurant we both love, so I thought I’d just bring that instead. I figured it would be fine since it’s something we both enjoy.

When I got to her place, everyone else had brought homemade dishes, and it looked amazing. Sarah had put a lot of effort into her cooking. I felt a little embarrassed when I placed my takeout container on the table. I noticed a few of our friends exchanged looks, and Sarah's face fell a bit when she saw it.

During dinner, I could tell she was trying to be polite, but she seemed disappointed. Eventually, she gently said, “I really hoped everyone would bring something homemade tonight.” I brushed it off and said, “Well, it’s what I had, and it’s still good!” I thought I was being funny, but looking back, I could see it might have come off as dismissive.

After dinner, Sarah and I had a private moment where she told me she felt let down that I didn’t put in the same effort as everyone else. I got defensive and told her that takeout is still food and that I didn’t think it was a big deal. She seemed upset and I left feeling like I hadn’t really done anything wrong.

Now I’m wondering if I should have put more effort into bringing something special for her celebration, even if it meant cooking something or at least being more considerate of her feelings. AITA?",261,522,0.51,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_67787,2019-05-14 00:00:00,YTA,2017,AITA

The issue arose when I decided that I wanted to treat myself to a new gaming console that just came out. I had been saving for it, and I was excited to finally make the purchase. I told my girlfriend about it, and she immediately started to express her disapproval. She said that we should be saving more for future expenses, like a vacation or a bigger apartment, instead of spending money on ""toys."" I understand her perspective, but I feel like I work hard and deserve to enjoy my money too.

In a fit of frustration, I told her that I didn't care about her opinion on my personal expenses and that if I wanted to buy a gaming console, I would. I also mentioned that I would consider it a priority over saving for a vacation, which we hadn’t even planned yet. This really upset her, and she accused me of being selfish and not considering our shared goals.

I still went ahead and bought the console, and I thought it was fine since I had saved up for it, but she wasn't speaking to me for a few days after that. When I tried to talk to her about it, I ended up getting defensive and said that if she wanted to save money, she could do that too, but I wouldn’t change my spending habits just because she wasn’t on board.

My sister has a 3-year-old daughter, and we’ve always been really close. I’ve been helping her out a lot since she became a single mom, watching my niece while she works and even babysitting on weekends so she can have some time to herself. 

Recently, my sister started dating someone seriously, and she asked me how I felt about it. I told her I was happy for her, but I made a comment about how I didn’t want her new boyfriend to think he could come in and play the dad role too soon. I said something like, “He’s not her dad, so he shouldn’t act like it.” 

My sister seemed taken aback and said that she didn’t appreciate my tone and that her boyfriend was really good with my niece. I shrugged it off and told her that I was just looking out for her and my niece. 

Later, I overheard her talking to a friend about how I was being unsupportive and how it hurt her feelings. I confronted her and said I didn’t understand why she was getting upset over me wanting to protect my niece. I told her that she shouldn’t let a new guy step in and try to take on a parental role when he doesn’t even know her that well. 

My sister said that I was being controlling and that it wasn't fair to judge someone she cared about without giving him a chance. I told her I was just being realistic. 

Now, things are a bit tense between us. I still think I was right to voice my concerns, but I can tell she feels hurt.

I’ve always supported her, but I also enjoy food and have a more relaxed approach to eating.

For my birthday, I decided to order a bunch of pizzas and have a cake, which is what I really wanted. A week before the party, I casually mentioned the food plans to Sarah, and she expressed that she was uncomfortable around pizza because she was trying to lose weight and didn’t want to be tempted.

I thought about it but decided to stick with my original plan since it was my birthday and I wanted to enjoy the food I love. When she arrived at the party, she looked visibly upset when she saw the pizza and cake. I tried to lighten the mood by joking about it, but she just rolled her eyes and said, “I can’t believe you would choose pizza on a day like this when I’m trying to be good.”

I felt hurt and defensive, so I snapped back, “It’s my birthday, and I shouldn’t have to cater to your diet!” This led to an awkward tension for the rest of the night, and Sarah eventually left early, saying she felt unwelcome.

He asked if we could help him out with a few hundred dollars to cover the rest of the cost. My girlfriend was immediately on board and said we should help him, but I was reluctant.

I suggested that she consider a more budget-friendly venue closer to home, where more people could celebrate without straining their finances. 

She just brushed off my concerns and insisted that this was her dream wedding and that everyone should be happy to support her. I lost my temper and told her that she was being selfish and unrealistic. I felt like she was prioritizing her fantasy over the practicality of the situation and disregarding the feelings of our family members. I might’ve also said something about how she wasn’t really considering the sacrifices people would have to make to attend her wedding.

We have a tradition of going on a weekend camping trip every summer, just to unwind and reconnect. This year, we decided to invite a new friend, Sarah (25F), who recently moved to our town and is trying to get to know everyone.

The thing is, Sarah has this really intense personality. She's super enthusiastic about everything, which can be really overbearing at times.

I thought it was just a funny little comment.

When we arrived at the campsite, Sarah immediately jumped in with her ideas for activities and started organizing everything. I felt myself getting irritated, as I had envisioned the trip being more laid-back. I made another joke, saying, “Wow, Sarah, you’re planning a military operation here!” But this time, she just looked really upset and said she was trying to help.

Throughout the weekend, I kept making these small, sarcastic comments about her energy and the way she was handling everything. At one point, I even said, “I didn’t know we were signing up for a boot camp!” Most of my friends laughed, but I noticed Sarah looked more and more uncomfortable.

You're the Asshole,"I'm a 28-year-old woman who recently moved into a new apartment complex. I've always been a bit of a night owl and like to listen to music while I work on my hobbies in the evenings. I often have my speakers set up to play my favorite songs at a decent volume, usually until around 1 AM. 

A few nights ago, I was really getting into a project and didn’t realize how loud the music had gotten. I was singing along and having a great time when suddenly I heard a loud knock on my door. It was my neighbor, an older gentleman in his 60s, who asked me to turn the music down because it was disturbing his sleep. I was a bit annoyed because I thought it was pretty late, and I'm sure he could have just used earplugs or something.

Instead of just apologizing and turning it down, I told him he should invest in some better soundproofing for his apartment if he couldn't handle a little noise. I thought it was rude of him to interrupt my evening when I was just having fun. He looked taken aback, and I could tell I hurt his feelings, but I felt justified in my response.

Since then, I’ve kept playing my music at the same volume and even cranked it up a bit more to prove a point. I’ve noticed he’s been giving me dirty looks in the hallway and has complained to the management about the noise. I just think he needs to lighten up and accept that I have a right to enjoy my space too.

You're the Asshole,"Here's the long and short:

I (28F) have been dating my boyfriend (30M) for about a year. We have a pretty good relationship, but we have different ideas about how we should spend our free time. I’m really into fitness and love going to the gym, while he prefers to relax at home and play video games.

Recently, I decided to sign us up for a couples’ fitness class that I thought we would both enjoy. I thought it would be a fun way for us to bond, and I was excited about it. I paid for the class upfront, thinking it wouldn't be an issue since I wanted us to have a shared experience.

When I told him about it, he got really annoyed and said he wasn’t interested in working out with me and would rather just stay home. I tried to convince him, saying it would be fun and good for our relationship, but he was adamant that he didn’t want to go. I ended up getting frustrated because I felt like he was shutting me down without giving it a chance.

In a moment of anger, I decided to go to the first class without him and posted some pictures of me having fun on social media. I thought he would be happy for me, but instead, he got upset and said I should have respected his choice not to go. I brushed it off, saying he should just try to be more supportive.

Looking back, I realize that I might have been a bit pushy and disrespectful of his feelings. I just wanted to share something I loved with him, but I may have overstepped. 

So, AITA for signing us up for the fitness class without my boyfriend’s approval and then going without him?",541,1829,0.81,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_29314,2021-10-11 00:00:00,YTA,1547,AITA
You're the Asshole,"My friend Emily and I have been buddies since college. We’ve always had a close friendship, and I’ve always admired her dedication to her job in social work. Recently, she landed a promotion that required her to move to another state. I was really happy for her, but I also felt a bit upset because she would be leaving our town, and I knew that our friendship would inevitably change.

To cope with my feelings, I started talking more about my own life and accomplishments. I’ve been doing well at work too, and I guess I may have gotten a little too excited about my achievements. I started sharing my successes during our conversations, and while I didn’t mean to overshadow Emily, I sometimes noticed her getting quiet or changing the subject.

A few weeks ago, we had a final lunch together before her move. I wanted to make it special, so I booked us a nice restaurant. During the meal, I mentioned that I was considering applying for a big promotion at my job and how I was confident I could get it. I also talked about my plans for traveling and other personal projects I had lined up.

Towards the end of the lunch, Emily broke down. She told me that she felt like I was being insensitive to her situation and that I was trying to one-up her during such an emotional time. I was taken aback; I thought I was being supportive by sharing my excitement. I told her she was overreacting and that it wasn’t my fault she was feeling down about leaving. I even suggested that she should be happy for me instead of taking everything so personally.

Now, Emily hasn’t spoken to me since. I’ve reached out, but she keeps saying she needs space. My other friends are split on the issue—some think I was totally fine, while others believe I should have been more considerate about her feelings. I’m starting to feel guilty, but I honestly didn’t mean to hurt her. Was I really the asshole in this situation?",733,866,0.91,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_66021,2020-08-11 00:00:00,YTA,1904,AITA

I didn't know her very well, but I figured I would just bring it over to her. When I knocked on her door, she didn't answer, so I left the package on her porch and went back home.

Later that night, I noticed a message from Sarah on our neighborhood group chat. She was upset because the package contained a custom, handcrafted piece of art that she had ordered for her daughter’s birthday party, which was the next day. She said that if she didn't get it back soon, she would have to come up with an alternative gift, which would be a shame because it was something really special. I felt a bit guilty but also thought it wasn’t my fault she wasn’t home.

Instead of responding directly to her, I decided to post a snarky comment on the group chat, saying something like, “Maybe next time you should check your porch more often?” I thought it was funny and would get a laugh from some of the other neighbors. Instead, I received backlash, with several people saying I was being rude and insensitive given that it was for her child’s birthday.

When Sarah finally saw my comment, she was understandably upset and called me out for being inconsiderate. I brushed it off and continued to joke about it, which only made things worse. I really didn’t see what the big deal was; it was just a joke after all, and I didn’t feel like I did anything wrong by leaving her package on the porch.

You're the Asshole,"So, I recently got invited to a wedding by my cousin. It’s a big family event, and to be honest, I wasn't too excited about going. I haven't been close with her for years, and I never really liked her fiancé. They had a rocky relationship, and I think she’s rushing into things. I also know that the wedding is going to be a pretty extravagant affair, and I've been feeling a bit tight on money lately.

A week before the wedding, I decided to tell my cousin that I wouldn’t be able to make it. I told her that I had a prior commitment, which wasn’t entirely untrue—I had been planning a weekend getaway with some friends, but I could have easily rescheduled it since there was no accommodation booked yet. I just didn’t want to go to her wedding.

The truth is, I was also feeling a bit petty. I felt like she didn’t really care about our relationship, and she rarely reached out to me. I thought, ""Why should I go to her wedding if she never even invites me to do anything else?"" So, I figured it was my chance to show that I wasn't going to just show up because she was family.

On the day of the wedding, I was scrolling through social media and saw my cousin post pictures from the ceremony. She looked beautiful, and my heart sank a little. I ended up texting her a congratulatory message, but I felt kind of guilty. I knew she was probably disappointed I didn’t show up.

A couple of days later, I got a message from her saying how much she missed me and that she really wished I could have been there. It hit me that I might have hurt her feelings over my own stubbornness. I thought about how I wouldn't want someone to treat me that way, even if I wasn't that close with them.

So, was I the asshole for choosing not to attend my cousin's wedding just because I was feeling petty and didn't want to spend money? I feel like I might have overreacted, but I also think it was my choice.",183,679,0.94,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_68818,2023-11-21 00:00:00,YTA,1894,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I (29M) recently got engaged and started planning our wedding with my fiancée (28F). We both have large families, and the guest list is already overwhelming. One day, while chatting with some friends, I jokingly mentioned that I might create a ""no kids allowed"" rule for the wedding to keep things manageable. 

I thought it would be a great idea to have an adult-only wedding, especially since my sister (32F) has two young kids who are quite unruly. I told my fiancée about my idea, and she seemed a bit hesitant but ultimately agreed that it might be less stressful for us. 

I went ahead and sent out save-the-dates and made it clear in the invitations that it would be an adult-only event. My sister reached out to me, very upset. She explained that my niece and nephew are part of our family and should be included in the celebration. I told her that I didn't want their kids running around and causing chaos during the ceremony and reception. I thought I was being reasonable by wanting a more relaxed atmosphere.

When she pressed on, I got defensive and told her that if she couldn’t find a sitter, maybe it was time for her to reevaluate her priorities. I felt justified in my decision because I wanted the wedding to be a fun experience for myself and my fiancée, without the stress of children. After our conversation, my sister ended up saying she wouldn’t come if her kids weren’t welcome, which honestly made me a bit relieved because I didn’t want the drama.

After we finished our meal, the waiter brought us the bill, and we all chipped in to pay. However, I noticed that one of my friends, Emily, was a bit quiet during the payment process.

Later, I found out that Emily was in a tough financial situation. She had just lost her job and was struggling to make ends meet. She had planned to pay for her share of the meal, but when she saw how much it would be, she hesitated, not wanting to speak up in front of everyone. 

Feeling frustrated that she hadn’t contributed, I made a comment within earshot of the table about how it was unfair for the rest of us to foot the bill while some people just eat and run. I didn’t realize how hurtful my comment was until I saw her face drop. 

Afterward, she left the table, clearly upset, and we didn’t have a chance to really talk about it. My other friends later told me that I should have been more understanding and considerate of her situation.

One of the big things is that she decided to have a family-style dinner at the reception instead of a buffet, which works for some people, but I just think it’s going to be chaotic with so many guests.

Emma asked me to help her with her engagement party, which I was excited about. I immediately took the lead in the planning, even though she didn’t ask me to.

Instead of acknowledging her feelings, I got defensive and insisted that I knew what was best for her. I even accused her of being overly dramatic about needing these materials.

Last weekend, I planned a family gathering at our house to celebrate my sister's birthday. My daughter seemed a bit off that day, but I brushed it off and told her to cheer up because she would get to show off her dance skills later at the party. 

As guests arrived, my daughter was excited and wanted to perform for everyone. I thought it would be a great idea to let her showcase her dance routine, so I announced it to the guests without asking her first. She looked a bit hesitant but I pushed her to go ahead and perform. 

During her dance, I noticed some guests were not paying attention, as they were busy chatting and grabbing drinks. I yelled out, “Hey, everyone! Can you please watch her? She’s worked really hard for this!” and clapped loudly to draw attention to her. 

Instead of feeling encouraged, my daughter froze up and didn’t finish her routine. I felt embarrassed and frustrated, so I snapped at the guests, saying they were rude for not paying attention. Later, my daughter was upset and said she didn't want to dance anymore because it made her feel bad when I yelled. 

I thought I was just trying to support her, but now I realize I might have been too intense about it. I feel guilty for ruining the moment for her and for making her feel pressured.

You're the Asshole,"Hello,

I (30f) have a younger sister (25f) who just got engaged to her boyfriend of three years. While I’m happy for her, I can’t help but feel a bit annoyed because she keeps asking me to help with the wedding planning. 

I have my own life, a demanding job, and I just don’t have the time or energy to be involved in all the details. Despite this, I’ve done my best to help her out when I can, but I’ve been pretty vocal about how I find wedding planning tedious and uninteresting.

Recently, she asked me to be her maid of honor, and I reluctantly agreed, thinking it might help ease some of the pressure she feels. However, I made it clear that I wouldn’t be able to handle all the responsibilities that come with it—like organizing the bachelorette party or making any major decisions. 

When she wanted to go dress shopping, I made it known that I really didn’t care about it and that I’d just tag along if it was convenient for me. I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings, but I honestly just can’t muster excitement for something that doesn’t interest me.

After she vented to our mom about how I’m being unhelpful and distant, I snapped and told her that if she wanted someone more enthusiastic, she should have chosen a different maid of honor. Now she’s hurt, and I feel like I’m in the right because I shouldn’t have to pretend to care about something I find boring.

You're the Asshole,"So, I've been with my girlfriend for about three years now, and I genuinely care about her. She's smart, funny, and we have a lot of great times together. Recently, she decided she wanted to take a big trip abroad for a month to explore, which I thought was a fantastic idea. However, when she started planning, she expressed how she wanted to go backpacking through Europe, staying in hostels and living as cheaply as possible. 

I immediately felt uneasy about this because I have some pretty strong opinions about safety and comfort when traveling. So instead of supporting her adventurous spirit, I started voicing my concerns about staying in hostels and traveling on a budget. I kept bringing up all the potential dangers, like pickpockets, bad accommodations, and the lack of privacy. I didn't want her to go at all, and I made it clear that I thought she was making a huge mistake. 

As she got more excited about her plans and started talking about it with her friends, I became more critical, insisting that she should at least look into more comfortable and safer options. I even went as far as to suggest that we should do a more luxurious trip together instead, which she didn't seem interested in at all. 

Looking back, I realize I might have been projecting my own fears onto her, and instead of encouraging her to pursue her dreams, I was trying to control the situation. Now she's feeling discouraged and upset, and I'm starting to feel like I might have messed up. I just wanted to protect her, but I think I ended up being a real downer.

A few weeks ago, she decided to buy a brand new designer handbag that costs more than my monthly rent. I was shocked and told her it was a ridiculous purchase, especially since we’ve been trying to save money for a trip this summer. She brushed it off, saying it was a “reward” for working hard and that she deserved it.

After she bought the bag, I was honestly upset. I felt like I had to say something. So, I brought it up during dinner one night and told her that I didn’t think it was wise to spend money like that when we have other financial goals. I even suggested that she should consider returning it or at least not making such expensive purchases in the future.

She got really defensive and said I was being controlling, and that it was her money to spend however she wanted. I argued that as a couple, we needed to be on the same page about our finances and that her decision affected both of us. I think I might have gone a bit overboard when I said she was being irresponsible and immature for prioritizing a handbag over our future.

You're the Asshole,"Throwaway account because my friends and family know my main account. 

So I (30F) have a younger sister, *L* (25F), who recently got engaged to her girlfriend of two years. I'm super happy for them and love that they found each other, but I have a personal issue with their relationship due to my beliefs. I’m a bit old-fashioned and my family is very traditional, and while I'm not outright against LGBTQ+ rights, I feel uncomfortable with same-sex relationships.

When *L* asked me to be her maid of honor, I hesitated. I eventually agreed, but only because I didn’t want to ruin the moment for her. However, I made it clear that I wouldn’t be involved in any planning for the bachelorette party or any other events leading up to the wedding, and I told her I wouldn’t be comfortable participating in any of the wedding traditions that seemed ""too gay"" for my taste. I just felt it was better to be honest about my feelings rather than pretending to be someone I'm not.

This led to some tension. *L* was really hurt and called me out for being unsupportive. She said this was one of the most important days of her life, and by acting this way, I was making it all about my discomfort instead of celebrating her love. I told her that I would still show up on the wedding day to support her, just without the maid of honor duties. I thought that was enough.

Things escalated when our parents got involved. They sided with *L* and were really disappointed in me. They said that being there for her meant being supportive of her relationship, and by not wanting to fully participate, I was being disrespectful. I didn’t see it that way; I thought I was being true to myself.

Now, *L* is considering uninviting me from the wedding, and I feel hurt that she would even consider that. I believe I’m allowed to have my beliefs, and I shouldn't have to compromise them completely. I’ve always been kind to *L*, and this feels like an overreaction.

You're the Asshole,"UPDATE: I spoke to my neighbor about it. Details at the bottom of the post.

ORIGINAL POST:
I recently moved into a new apartment complex, and everything was going well until I met my neighbor, who lives directly below me. She’s a single mother with a toddler, and I can definitely hear them playing. It’s not just the normal sounds of a kid playing; it’s the loud shrieks and thuds of the toddler running around and jumping on furniture. It’s like living above a mini trampoline park. 

I typically work from home and have to be on calls throughout the day. The noise has been so disruptive that I can’t focus, and sometimes I even get frustrated in the middle of important meetings. I’ve tried using noise-canceling headphones and playing white noise, but it’s not cutting it. 

Last week, I finally decided to knock on her door and talk to her about it. When she answered, I immediately told her how disruptive her child’s noise was and that I couldn’t work because of it. I suggested that she should try to keep it down during the day, especially during my work hours. I even went as far as to mention that this wasn’t a daycare and that I expected a bit more consideration for the people living around her. 

She looked really hurt and said she was trying her best, but it’s tough to manage a toddler. I felt a bit bad afterward, but I still think she needs to control the noise better. I mean, I pay a lot for this apartment, and I shouldn’t have to deal with constant disruptions, right? 

AITA for telling my neighbor to keep her kid quiet because I need to work? 

Update detail: Thanks for the feedback! A few clarifications:
- I work in a field where I need to be very focused, and I have deadlines to meet.
- I didn’t consider that kids are naturally loud and that she’s doing her best as a single mom.
- I plan to talk to her again and maybe suggest playdates at a park instead of her apartment, but I want to make sure she understands my perspective first.",559,1080,0.78,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_22931,2019-08-27 00:00:00,YTA,1970,AITA

I’ve gotten used to having him around, but I still want to maintain some level of independence in my own space. One of the biggest issues we have is that he likes to borrow my things without asking. It annoys me, especially since he doesn’t take care of them.

Recently, he borrowed my favorite video game console for a weekend while I was out. When I came back, I found it was damaged. I confronted him about it, and he just shrugged it off, saying it was no big deal. That really upset me, so I decided to teach him a lesson. 

I went into his room while he was at school and took all of his gaming gear and locked it in a closet. I told him it was because he needed to learn to ask before borrowing things and that he could get it back once he apologized for the damage. He was really upset when he found out and said it was unfair that I was punishing him like that. 

I feel like I’m just trying to make him responsible, but now I’m wondering if I took it too far. AITA?",139,1873,1.0,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_28556,2023-05-29 00:00:00,YTA,1087,AITA

You're the Asshole,"My best friend and I have been close since childhood. We grew up together, shared secrets, and always supported each other through thick and thin. Recently, she decided to get married and asked me to be her maid of honor. I was honored and excited to help her plan the wedding and support her through the process.

However, as the wedding date approached, I started to feel overwhelmed with my own life. I was going through a tough time at work, and my personal life was in disarray. Instead of being the supportive friend she needed, I became distant and started to back out of the planning process. I didn’t attend meetings and often canceled when she wanted to discuss details. I even missed her bridal shower because I simply didn’t feel like going.

The day before the wedding, I called her and told her that I wouldn’t be able to attend the ceremony. I didn’t give her a good reason; I just said I needed to take care of myself and needed a day to myself. My friend was devastated and told me how much it meant to her to have me there. I brushed her off, saying she would be fine without me and that I had other priorities to focus on.

On the day of the wedding, I ended up doing nothing. I stayed home, wallowed in my problems, and scrolled through social media, seeing all the pictures from an event I was supposed to be a part of.

A couple of weeks ago, my sister asked if I could watch the kids for a whole Saturday because they had a wedding to attend. I explained that I had plans to hang out with my friends that day, and I really didn’t want to cancel. She got upset and said it was hard for her to find someone else, and that she always relied on me to help out.

I told her that while I care for the kids, I also have my own life and interests, and I can’t just be available whenever she needs a babysitter. She kept insisting that family helps each other out, and I should be there for her. I felt guilty but stood my ground and said I wouldn’t be able to help that weekend.

After that, she ended up finding someone else to watch the kids, but she hasn't spoken to me much since then. I feel bad that she’s upset, but I also think it's unreasonable for her to expect me to drop everything for her.

Last week, she bought herself a new handbag that was quite expensive. When I saw it, I couldn’t help but bring it up. I told her that it was irresponsible to spend that much on a single item when we have bills to pay, and I reminded her of our goal to save for a vacation. I even pulled out our budget spreadsheet to show her how we were falling behind on savings because of her spending habits.

She got upset and told me that she works hard and deserves to treat herself sometimes. I didn’t think it was fair to make that kind of purchase when we have other priorities. Instead of just letting it go, I kept bringing it up over the next few days, trying to make her see my point of view.

A few weeks ago, she asked me to be her best man. I was honored and agreed, but I also mentioned that I wouldn’t be able to give a speech because public speaking makes me anxious. She insisted that I had to give a speech, saying it was tradition and that I should get over my fears for her big day. I felt pressured, but I didn’t want to let her down, so I agreed to try.

Fast forward to the wedding day. I was nervous, of course, and when it came time for the speeches, I was shaking. I stood up to speak, and halfway through, my mind went blank. I panicked and ended up not saying anything meaningful; I just made a few awkward jokes that didn’t land well. The room was quiet and my sister looked disappointed. I could see she was upset, and that made me even more anxious.

After the speeches, she pulled me aside and started to tear into me about how I embarrassed her in front of everyone. She said I ruined her special moment and that I should have practiced more. I got defensive and told her that I tried my best and that she pressured me into it. Instead of comforting me, she just kept berating me, and I ended up walking away feeling hurt.

Later, I overheard her telling our parents that she was considering asking me to step down as best man because I “couldn’t handle the pressure.” I felt really betrayed and hurt that she would say that about me on such an important day.

Feeling frustrated, I jokingly said, “Well, I guess you don’t care about family, huh?” It was meant to be light-hearted, but I could tell it hurt her feelings. She got quiet and said she would think about it, but I could see that she was upset.

Later, I continued to poke fun at the situation, making comments about how her future in-laws must be thrilled to know their son is marrying someone who doesn’t care about her family.

The thing is, I really don’t like the design of the jersey; it’s bright orange with a huge logo on it that I find really tacky.

The day of the game came, and I decided to wear a plain black hoodie instead of the jersey. I figured it would be more comfortable and that I could still be supportive without wearing something I didn’t like. When I got to the game, my brother spotted me right away, and his face fell when he saw I wasn’t wearing his jersey. He looked really disappointed and even asked me why I didn’t wear it.

I accused him of being selfish and not taking our relationship seriously.

After that argument, I started to question our entire relationship. I began dropping hints about how great it would be to have a baby and what our future could look like.

However, he’s often asked for help from our parents and me, whether it’s financial support or a place to crash while he figures things out.

Recently, Jake reached out to me, really excited, saying he found an amazing opportunity to join a team of digital nomads who travel the world and work remotely. I was happy for him but also a bit concerned. He told me he needed money to help cover his expenses to get started — about $2,000. I was hesitant because he’s asked for money several times before, and I wasn't sure he would use it wisely.

After some back and forth, I told him I could give him the money, but he needed to promise to stick to a budget and focus on saving once he got settled. He agreed, and I wired him the cash. But I found out through our parents that he used most of the money to book a luxury stay in a tropical resort instead of the budget accommodations we discussed. 

I felt betrayed and hurt that he didn’t take my advice seriously. When I confronted him about it, he told me I was being uptight and that he deserved to enjoy life while he can. I ended up yelling at him, saying he was wasting his potential and that he would regret this choice later. 

Now, our family is divided. My parents think I was too harsh and that I should’ve supported him more in his dreams, while I believe I had every right to be angry because he's not taking his life seriously. I honestly feel like he should be more responsible.

I’ve always been supportive of her fitness journey, but I can’t help but feel like she’s becoming a bit obsessive.

Last week, we were at a friend's party, and she brought her own food. I thought it was a little strange, especially since I had made plans to enjoy some of the dishes that our friends prepared. I jokingly said, ""Come on, just live a little! You can have a piece of cake!"" She looked at me like I had just insulted her and said, ""You don't understand how hard this is for me.""

Well, it really seemed to upset her. She said she had spent hours preparing these meals and that it was frustrating to hear me dismiss them like that. I shrugged it off and told her that she shouldn’t take it personally; I just prefer what I prefer. The dinner ended up being pretty awkward, and I could tell she was hurt.

Later, we exchanged messages, and I told her that I was just being honest about my tastes and that she shouldn’t expect everyone to love what she loves.

I thought it would be a nice touch since Sarah has been on a health kick lately.

When people started arriving, I served the nachos and the dip. Most of my friends were excited about the nachos, but Sarah immediately frowned when she saw the food. She went on to criticize my nachos, saying they were “too unhealthy” and “not in line with the lifestyle she’s trying to maintain.” I was taken aback because she has never complained about my food before.

I jokingly said, ""Well, if you wanted a salad, maybe you should have just brought one!"" It was meant to be lighthearted, but she snapped back and accused me of not being supportive of her choices.

Honestly, I felt really hurt. I put effort into preparing the food and wanted everyone to have a good time. I tried to explain that it was just one night and that she could enjoy the nachos without feeling guilty. She ended up leaving early, and I felt like I didn’t do anything wrong.

When they showed up, everything seemed fine until I noticed my friend’s girlfriend was a bit quiet and not engaging much with the group. I thought it would be funny to poke a bit of fun at her, so during a break in the games, I made a joke about how she must be the ""quiet one"" in the group and teased her a bit about it.

I could see she was uncomfortable, but I thought it was just her being shy, so I kept going, saying things like, “Don’t worry, you’ll warm up eventually!” and “You’re just here for the snacks, huh?” My friends laughed, but I noticed she started to look more and more upset. Eventually, she told me she didn’t appreciate the jokes and felt like I was making fun of her.

I brushed it off, saying it was all in good fun and that she needed to lighten up. Later, my friend pulled me aside and said that I really hurt her feelings and that I should apologize. I told him I didn’t see what the big deal was and that I thought it was just harmless teasing.

It felt like every time we planned to hang out, she would cancel because Mark wanted to spend time with her instead.

One day, Sarah invited me over to her apartment for a girls' night. I was really looking forward to it, but a few hours before I was supposed to arrive, she texted me saying Mark had surprised her with a dinner reservation and she couldn't make it.

When she told me about the dinner, I replied with a snarky text, saying, ""Wow, I guess I’m just not important anymore."" She tried to reassure me, saying that this was just a special occasion and she still wanted to hang out. But I kept pushing, insisting that she was always putting him first and that it seemed like I was just a backup friend. 

Things escalated when I told her that if she was going to ignore me for him, maybe I should just stop reaching out altogether. I didn't realize how harsh I was being until she started to cry. She told me that I was being selfish and that she valued our friendship, but she also needed to make time for her boyfriend. I felt a bit guilty, but I didn't back down at first.

I told her that she should really reconsider her decision and not be so impulsive just because the puppy is cute. I thought I was just being honest with her, but she got really upset.

I'm aware that this might make me come off as a huge jerk, but I hope you'll hear me out.

So, I’ve been friends with this guy, Jake, for a few years now. We’ve always had a pretty laid-back friendship, but recently, he went through a rough breakup. He was really upset and vented to me about how heartbroken he was, and I tried my best to support him during that tough time.

A few weeks later, I decided to host a small gathering at my place with some mutual friends, and I thought it would be a good way to help Jake take his mind off things. I made sure to invite him and even planned a few fun activities. 

However, I also invited a girl, Sarah, who Jake had a crush on before his breakup. I thought it would be funny to see if they would hit it off, so I intentionally set up some scenarios to put them together. I thought I was being a good friend by trying to cheer him up and possibly even get him to move on.

During the gathering, things didn’t go as I expected. Jake was visibly uncomfortable and ended up pulling me aside to express that he didn’t want to see Sarah, as he wasn’t ready to deal with those feelings yet. I brushed it off and told him to lighten up; it was just a little fun.

I kept nudging them together throughout the night, thinking I was helping him. Eventually, Jake left the party early, and I found out later that he was really upset about how the evening went. He told me I was being insensitive and that he felt like I disregarded his feelings. 

In my mind, I thought I was just trying to help him get over his ex, and I didn’t want him to dwell on his heartbreak. Now, I’m wondering if I really crossed a line and messed up our friendship. 

So, Reddit, AITA for trying to help my friend move on even though he explicitly said he wasn’t ready?",436,999,0.58,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_56601,2021-11-26 00:00:00,YTA,1800,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I recently attended a friend’s birthday party, and it was a casual backyard gathering. Everyone was enjoying food, drinks, and good company. I was feeling pretty good and decided to bring out my karaoke machine, as I love singing and thought it would be a fun addition to the party.

As the night went on, I got a bit carried away with the karaoke. I began singing loudly and really getting into it, despite most of the guests being more interested in chatting and eating than in my performance. At one point, I noticed a few people exchanging amused looks and some even started to clap along, which only encouraged me to go bigger.

I decided to sing a rather long ballad, which is one of my favorites, and I really overdid it. I belted out the lyrics, completely oblivious to how it was bothering others. Some guests began to look annoyed, and I could see a couple of them whispering to each other. But I was having too much fun to notice.

About halfway through the song, one of my friends, who was sitting down with a group, finally spoke up and asked if I could take a break for a bit so they could enjoy their conversation. I took it as a joke at first and joked back that they should join me for a duet. But he looked serious and said that it was getting a bit overwhelming. I don’t know what came over me, but I found it really insulting. I snapped back, saying that it was my karaoke machine and my time to shine, and they should just enjoy the show.

This caused a bit of tension, and people started to awkwardly laugh it off while trying to change the subject. I finished my song, but I could feel the atmosphere had shifted. After that, I decided to keep singing because I thought I might as well finish strong. I didn’t realize how it was affecting the mood of the party.

Later, I overheard some guests saying they were going to leave early because they weren’t enjoying the party anymore. I couldn’t help but feel a little hurt and angry, thinking they were being too sensitive. I also felt frustrated with my friend for interrupting my performance.

Looking back, I realize that I may have made the party uncomfortable for others. I should have listened to my friend and considered how my actions were impacting the vibe of the gathering.

You're the Asshole,"So, I (28F) have been living with my roommate (30M) for about a year now. When we moved in together, we agreed to split all the household chores and responsibilities, which included cleaning, cooking, and grocery shopping. I usually enjoy cooking, but I have a busy job and I tend to get pretty exhausted during the week.

Recently, I’ve noticed that my roommate has been taking on more of the cooking responsibilities. At first, I thought it was great, but then I realized he was making meals that I really don’t like. He’s a big fan of spicy food and I absolutely cannot handle it. I politely tried telling him a few times that I’d prefer milder dishes, but he just shrugged it off, saying that he enjoys cooking what he likes and that I could always eat something else if I didn’t like it.

Last week, he made this incredibly spicy curry that literally made me cry when I took a bite. I was so frustrated that instead of just making myself something else, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I went into the kitchen when he was out for the day and threw away all the spices and ingredients he usually uses to make his meals. I figured that if he didn’t have anything to cook with, he’d have to make something that I actually wanted to eat.

When he came home and found his spices missing, he was absolutely furious. He called me an asshole for throwing away his things and ruining his meals. I told him it was for the best since he obviously didn’t care about my tastes. He didn’t see it that way at all, saying I was being controlling and rude.

Now he’s been sulking around and cooking for himself separately, and honestly, I don’t feel bad about it. I think I did the right thing because having meals that I enjoy is super important to me, and he should have considered my preferences more. I’m starting to wonder if maybe I overreacted a bit, but I still think he should understand why I did it. AITA?",859,2840,0.7,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_10923,2022-04-15 00:00:00,YTA,1917,AITA

Last weekend, I had plans to go out with my friends for a birthday celebration, and I told my sister I couldn’t babysit her kids that night. She was really upset, which made me feel guilty. To make it up to her, I decided to crash at her place after my night out and ""surprise"" her by cleaning her house while she was out. 

When she got home, she found me scrubbing her kitchen floors. Instead of being grateful, she was really frustrated and told me that I was overstepping by coming into her home uninvited and making changes without asking. I thought I was being helpful, but it turned into a big argument.

I’ve been helping her out financially, covering her rent and some of her bills. I genuinely want to support her during this tough time because I know how hard it can be to find a job.

Last week, she asked if she could borrow my laptop for a couple of days to work on her resume and apply for jobs. I agreed, but I specifically told her to be careful with it since it’s important for my work. I also mentioned that my laptop is pretty old and I worry about it crashing if it gets too overloaded with programs or files.

A few days later, I got my laptop back, and I noticed it was running extremely slow. When I checked, I saw that she had downloaded a bunch of software that I didn’t approve of and had filled the hard drive with all of her application files. I confronted her about it, and she brushed it off, saying it was just a “temporary thing” while she was applying for jobs.

After that, I tried to uninstall the unnecessary programs myself, but it didn’t fix the slow performance. I ended up having to factory reset the laptop, which meant I lost some of my important work files that I hadn’t backed up. I was really upset and told her how irresponsible she had been. Instead of apologizing, she got defensive and said that I was overreacting and that I shouldn’t care so much about a “few files.”

Now, I’ve decided to not let her borrow my laptop anymore, and I told her that she needs to figure out her own tech situation.

Recently, I invited her to a big party I was hosting to celebrate my promotion at work. I was really excited about it and wanted her to be there to celebrate with me.

When I told Sarah about the party, she initially seemed hesitant and mentioned that she wasn't really in the mood for socializing. I brushed it off, telling her that she should come anyway and that it would be fun. I even went as far as to say that it would be a shame if she missed out on such a great opportunity to meet new people and have fun. I pressured her pretty hard, insisting that she could stay for just an hour if she wanted to.

Eventually, she agreed to come, but I could tell she was still uncomfortable. When she arrived, she seemed overwhelmed by the crowd and quickly retreated to a corner of the room. I tried to introduce her to some of my friends, but she looked visibly anxious and didn’t engage in conversations. After a while, she told me that she needed to leave because she was feeling too anxious.

I was frustrated and felt like she had let me down by not being more open to the experience. After she left, I posted about the party on social media and mentioned how Sarah almost didn’t come and how I had to convince her to join. I thought it would come off as playful, but she saw the post and texted me saying that I made her feel bad for not being as social as everyone else.

You're the Asshole,"Hey everyone,

I’m looking for some perspective on a situation that happened with my friend recently. 

So, I’ve been friends with Sarah for over five years. She recently got a promotion at work, and to celebrate, she invited a few close friends, including me, to dinner at a nice restaurant. I was excited to go, but I also knew that it could get expensive since this place is known for its pricey dishes.

When we got to the restaurant, I realized that I didn’t really have enough money to cover my share of the meal, especially if we ordered drinks and dessert. I didn’t want to come off as cheap or ruin the celebration, so I decided to pretend I was fine financially. 

As the night went on, I ordered a few drinks and a nice entrée, thinking I’d figure something out later. When the bill came, I panicked. I didn't want to embarrass myself in front of my friends, especially Sarah, who had just celebrated her promotion. I ended up suggesting that we all split the bill evenly, knowing that it would be more than my share.

Sarah seemed a bit taken aback when I suggested splitting it, but she agreed. When it came time to pay, I realized I was short. I had to borrow money from another friend at the table, who was clearly uncomfortable about it. Sarah ended up covering the difference for me without saying anything, but I could tell she wasn’t happy.

Later, I told her I appreciated her generosity, but she pointed out that I should have been honest about my financial situation instead of pretending everything was fine. I brushed it off, thinking she was overreacting. 

Now I’m wondering if I was in the wrong for not being upfront about my financial situation. I thought I was just trying to celebrate with my friends, but maybe I was being selfish.

Recently, Lily graduated from a prestigious art school and had her first solo exhibition, which was a huge deal for her. My parents were over the moon and even flew in relatives to support her. I was genuinely happy for her, but I couldn't shake the feeling of being overshadowed, even though I also had my own accomplishments.

Instead of attending her exhibition to celebrate, I decided to organize a surprise party for my own recent promotion at work. I invited family and friends, scheduling it for the same weekend as her exhibition, thinking it would be a fun way to celebrate my success. I figured Lily would understand and celebrate with me afterward.

On the day of her exhibition, I was busy setting up my party. I sent Lily a text wishing her good luck and telling her I was proud of her, but I didn’t go see her art. After the exhibition, Lily showed up at my party, clearly upset. She confronted me, saying that I had stolen her moment and it was the biggest day of her life. 

I brushed it off, saying I deserved to celebrate my accomplishments too. I told her that I didn’t think it was a big deal and that she could have just come to my party afterward. 

Now, our family is divided. Some say I was right to celebrate my own achievements, while others think I should have prioritized Lily’s big day. I feel justified in wanting my own moment, but I’m starting to wonder if I was too dismissive of her feelings.

You're the Asshole,"So I (28F) am the oldest of three siblings. I have a younger sister (22F) and a younger brother (19M). Growing up, my parents instilled in us a strong work ethic and encouraged us to pursue our passions. I went to college, landed a decent job, and really focused on my career. My sister did the same, but my brother, on the other hand, has always been a bit of the black sheep in the family.

He’s really into art and spends most of his time painting and drawing, which I think is great. However, he decided not to go to college despite our parents’ encouragement. He also works part-time at a local cafe, but he rarely puts in the effort to find better opportunities or develop his skills further. He often makes excuses for why he can't improve or pursue his art in a more professional way.

Recently, my brother had an art show at a local gallery. I was excited for him and went to support him, but honestly, I felt a bit embarrassed. His artwork was pretty mediocre compared to some of the other artists there. A lot of what he presented was just unfinished sketches or pieces that didn’t really resonate with anyone. After the show, I tried to give him some constructive criticism, hoping to motivate him to take his art more seriously.

I said something like, ""You know, if you really want to be taken seriously as an artist, you should focus on completing your pieces and maybe even consider taking some classes. There’s so much potential in you, but you need to work harder."" He looked really hurt by my comments and just brushed me off, saying he was happy with what he was doing.

A few days later, my parents called a family meeting to discuss my brother's future. They expressed their concerns about his lack of ambition and his reluctance to improve. I chimed in, agreeing with them, and even said, ""It's like he doesn't want to succeed. He has all this talent but isn't doing anything with it."" My brother overheard me and got furious. He accused me of belittling his passion and being dismissive of his art, which I honestly didn’t think I was. I just wanted him to succeed!

Now, my brother isn't talking to me, and my parents are a bit caught in the middle. They said I should have been more supportive instead of critical.

I live in a small neighborhood with a tight-knit community, and I have a dog that I absolutely adore. However, my dog can be quite boisterous and energetic, especially when he sees other dogs or people. There’s a family with young children who live next door, and they often play in their yard.

A few weeks ago, while I was out walking my dog, he spotted the kids playing and started barking loudly and pulling on the leash to get to them. I thought it was harmless fun and that the kids would enjoy playing with him, so I loosened his leash and let him run up to them.

Despite their request, I didn’t think it was a big deal. I let my dog off the leash again the other day when I saw the children outside. This time, he ran over and started playing with them, but he got a little too rough and accidentally knocked over a toy they were playing with. The parents came out again, looking frustrated.

The issue arose when she asked me to be her maid of honor, which I was thrilled about—until I found out that she wanted me to wear a bridesmaid dress that was almost identical to the one I wore at my own wedding.

You see, I got married about a year ago, and the dress I wore was a beautiful, custom-made gown that I spent a lot of time and money on. It was a big deal for me, and I felt like it represented a significant moment in my life. When I brought up my concerns to my sister about wearing the same style dress, she dismissed me, saying, “It’s just a dress, and I want my wedding to have a cohesive look.”

I felt hurt. To me, it felt like she was overshadowing my special moment and trying to take away the uniqueness of my own wedding. I suggested that she could choose a different style or color that still fit her theme, but she insisted on wanting me in that particular dress. I ended up feeling very frustrated and began to wonder if she was trying to make her wedding more about my past than her future.

In a moment of anger and resentment, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I told her that I wouldn’t wear the dress she wanted, and I went ahead and bought a completely different, much more extravagant dress that I loved and felt confident in. I thought this would show her that I wanted to stand out at her wedding and that my style should be respected. 

When I showed her the new dress, she was visibly upset. She told me that it didn’t match her vision for the wedding and that I was being selfish by not wanting to support her vision. I felt momentarily guilty but then justified my actions by thinking that my wedding was perfect, and I wanted to make a statement at hers too.

I can tell my sister is hurt, and now there's some tension between us. I feel like I did what I had to do to stand my ground, but I also recognize that my actions may have upset her. I’m starting to wonder if I am the bad guy for prioritizing my own feelings over my sister’s special day.

You're the Asshole,"I recently started a new job at a small office and was excited to get to know my coworkers. One of them, Sarah, is a single mom and often has to juggle her work commitments with her parenting responsibilities. I noticed that she sometimes had to leave work a bit early to pick up her kids or attend to other family matters. 

One day, I overheard her talking to our boss about needing to leave a little earlier that week because her childcare fell through. Instead of being supportive, I took it upon myself to make a dismissive comment to her in front of others, saying, ""Maybe if you didn’t have kids, you wouldn’t have to worry about this."" 

I thought I was being funny and making a light-hearted joke, but it clearly backfired. Sarah looked hurt, and a couple of other coworkers shot me disapproving looks. Afterward, I brushed it off, thinking she was just being overly sensitive. 

Later, I found out that several people were upset with my comment and felt it was uncalled-for. Some even said I should apologize, but I felt like it was a joke that didn’t need an apology. I just wanted to lighten the mood and didn’t think too much of it. 

Looking back, I realize that my comment was not only inappropriate but also insensitive to Sarah's situation as a single parent. I thought I was being funny, but now I see I came off as an ass. AITA?",157,2409,0.92,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_89378,2022-08-10 00:00:00,YTA,1347,AITA
You're the Asshole,"Background: My friend Lisa recently had a big birthday party that she had been planning for months. She invited a lot of people, and it was a themed costume party. The theme was ""Favorite Movie Characters,"" and everyone was excited to dress up and celebrate.

I decided to go as a character from a movie I love, but I wanted to put my own twist on it. Instead of a recognizable costume, I went for a more abstract representation of the movie’s themes. I wore a t-shirt with a clever quote from the film and a bunch of accessories that were not really in line with what anyone else was wearing. I thought it was funny and unique.

When I arrived at the party, I realized that most people went all out with their costumes, and I felt a bit out of place. I could see that my outfit didn’t really resonate with anyone, and some people were outright confused by what I was wearing. Instead of rolling with it, I decided to make a few jokes at their expense, poking fun at how seriously they took the theme. I was trying to be funny, but I could see that I was making some people uncomfortable.

As the night went on, Lisa, the birthday girl, pulled me aside and asked me to tone it down because people were starting to feel awkward about my comments. I brushed her off, saying it was all in good fun and that they should lighten up. I continued to joke about their costumes and how invested they were in a silly theme, thinking I was just being entertaining.

In the end, Lisa was visibly upset, and a few guests left early because they felt I was ruining the vibe. Now I’m wondering if I crossed a line. So, am I the asshole for making fun of my friends’ costumes at Lisa's birthday party?",944,1135,0.97,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_64994,2021-03-14 00:00:00,YTA,1685,AITA

Recently, Jessica started dating someone seriously, and while I’m happy for her, I can’t help but feel a bit abandoned. She’s been spending almost all her time with her new boyfriend, Mike, and it feels like she has completely forgotten about our friendship.

Last week, Jessica invited me to her apartment for movie night, which I was really looking forward to. But when I arrived, Mike was there too. I thought it would just be the three of us hanging out, but instead, it turned into a date night with them cuddling on the couch while I awkwardly sat on the other side. I tried to join in on the conversation, but they just kept whispering to each other and laughing, clearly not interested in including me.

After a couple of hours, I got frustrated. I jokingly said, “Wow, am I even allowed to watch the movie, or should I just go home?” They both looked at me with surprise, and I could tell that I had crossed a line. Jessica responded, “Dude, you’re being really rude. This is our time together.” Instead of apologizing, I doubled down and said, “Well, if you’re going to ditch your best friend for your boyfriend, maybe I don’t want to be here anyway.”

Jessica ended up kicking me out, and I left feeling really upset. I reached out to her the next day and apologized, saying I didn’t mean to ruin her night, but I also told her I felt left out. However, I still think she should have made more of an effort to include me instead of just acting like I wasn’t there.

Recently, I noticed that Ethan has been getting increasingly attached to me, often calling me ""Auntie"" and wanting to spend all his time with me. I guess I was flattered by it and enjoyed being the fun adult in his life. So, I started to get a bit carried away.

One day, I decided to throw a small surprise party for Ethan's birthday, even though Laura had mentioned wanting to keep it low-key this year with just family. I figured I knew what was best for a kid's birthday and went ahead with the planning. I invited a few of my friends and their kids, bought decorations, and even made a cake. I was so excited to make Ethan's day special.

When Laura found out about the party, she was furious. She told me that she wanted to keep Ethan's birthday simple and that I had overstepped my boundaries by organizing something without consulting her first. I tried to explain that I only wanted to make Ethan happy, but she said it was not my place to decide what kind of celebration he should have. 

I ended up apologizing, but I felt confused because I genuinely thought I was doing something nice. I mean, who wouldn’t want a fun birthday party, right? Now Laura is still upset with me, and I’m starting to think maybe I should have just let her handle it.

You're the Asshole,"I work as a manager at a retail store, and we have a policy that allows employees to take a certain number of unpaid leave days each year. Recently, one of my employees, Sarah, approached me asking for a few days off because her grandmother was in the hospital and she wanted to spend time with her. I understand that family emergencies can be overwhelming, and I do my best to support my team.

However, I noticed that Sarah has already taken several unpaid days this year, and I reminded her of our policy that limits the number of unpaid leaves to prevent abuse. She seemed really upset and said that this was a critical time for her family. I can empathize with her situation, but I also have to enforce the rules fairly for everyone.

Instead of granting her extra days off, I told her that she would need to use her remaining unpaid leave days if she wanted to be with her grandmother. I suggested that she could try to manage her time better and find ways to work around her schedule. Sarah started to cry and said she felt like I didn’t care about her family situation. I told her that I understand her feelings, but I have to treat everyone equally and that rules are in place for a reason.

In hindsight, I could have offered her some flexibility, maybe by allowing her to take a short leave even if it exceeded the policy, but I felt like that would set a bad precedent. I just wanted to maintain order and consistency in the workplace.

I know she’s been stressed about the finances, so I thought I would help out by offering her my old wedding dress. I wore it for my wedding five years ago, and while it’s not in style anymore, I figured it would save her some money.

When I brought it up, she looked really uncomfortable and said she wanted to pick out her own dress, something that reflects her own style. I thought she was being ungrateful and insisted that my dress was beautiful and that she should just wear it. I even went so far as to say that I can’t believe she wouldn’t want to wear a family dress that has sentimental value.

After a heated argument, she told me that if I couldn’t respect her choice, then maybe I shouldn’t be the maid of honor. I was really hurt and upset because I was just trying to help. Now I'm wondering if I crossed a line by pushing her to wear my dress instead of supporting her vision.

You're the Asshole,"My girlfriend (28F) and I (30M) have been dating for about three years. Overall, our relationship is great, but there is one issue that I just can’t seem to get over. She has a close-knit group of friends, and they often go out to bars and parties together. I’m not a huge fan of drinking or being around loud crowds, so I usually stay home when they go out.

Recently, they invited her to a big party for one of their birthdays, and she was really excited about it. However, the problem is that her friends have a tendency to be pretty wild when they drink, and she often ends up staying out really late or coming home in a less-than-ideal state. I don’t want to play the controlling boyfriend, but I expressed my concerns about her safety and how I feel uncomfortable with her being around that kind of environment.

After talking it over, she still wanted to go to this party, and I told her I thought it was a bad idea. I ended up making some comments about how her friends are a bad influence, and I suggested that she should reconsider going out with them. I know I came off as judgmental, but I really do worry about her well-being in those situations. 

When she went to the party anyway, I felt hurt and disrespected. I ended up texting her throughout the night, asking if she was okay and if she could please come home early. She didn’t respond for hours, and when she finally did, she just said she was having fun and would be home later.

By the time she got home, I was really upset and let her have it. I said that I was disappointed in her for choosing to hang out with people who don't respect her and for putting herself in a risky situation. I might have yelled a bit more than I should have, and honestly, it felt like I was attacking her character rather than just expressing concern.

Now, she’s really hurt and feels like I don’t trust her or care about her happiness.

When they announced their engagement, I was supportive at first, but then I found out that they were planning a big wedding. Like, really big. I didn’t want to rain on their parade, but I couldn’t help but mention that they might want to consider a smaller, more budget-friendly option, especially since Jake just started a new job and Lisa is still in school.

Jake got really defensive and said that it was their wedding and their choice. I agreed, but I still felt that my input was valid given their financial situation. So, I ended up making a sarcastic comment about how it would be a shame if they went into debt over a wedding when they could use that money for a house or something more practical.

After that, Lisa seemed upset, and I noticed she was a bit distant with me at family gatherings. I brushed it off, thinking it was just wedding stress. But then, I decided to throw a small engagement party for them at my house, hoping it would help mend things a bit.

During the party, I ended up making another offhand joke about how big weddings are just a way to show off, and that it would be funny if they ended up eloping instead of spending a fortune on a big bash. Everyone laughed, but Jake looked really hurt, and Lisa just walked out of the room.

A few days later, Jake called me to express that he felt I was being overly critical and that my comments were hurtful. I told him that I was just looking out for him and that he shouldn’t take it so personally. He said that if I was going to keep making remarks like that, I might not be welcome at the wedding.

The problem is that our neighbors, who live in the unit next to us, have been using the common area for their own parking, and it frustrates me because they have a dedicated spot as well.

One day, I came home after a long shift at work and found that the common area was completely blocked by three of their cars. I couldn’t even park my own car.

It all smelled amazing.

While we were eating, I found myself getting a bit bored with the healthy food and craving something more indulgent, like pizza or tacos. I jokingly said, ""This is great and all, but I could really go for some pizza right now!"" I didn’t think much of it at the time, but Sarah looked visibly annoyed. She said something like, ""Well, maybe if you actually put in the effort to eat well, you wouldn't be craving junk food all the time.""

Instead of taking her comment in stride, I snapped back, ""It's easy for you to say! You’re the one who’s obsessed with fitness and has a six-pack. Not all of us can stick to a strict diet like you!"" It turned into a bit of an argument, and we ended up not talking much for the rest of the night.

Looking back, I realize I may have been too harsh and dismissive of her efforts to promote a healthy lifestyle. I know she was trying to inspire me, but I let my frustration take over. I feel bad about how I reacted and wonder if I crossed a line. I really didn’t mean to upset her, but I was just being honest about what I was feeling.",147,2743,0.78,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_83579,2022-01-20 00:00:00,YTA,1717,AITA
You're the Asshole,"Me and my partner recently decided to host a game night at our apartment, inviting a few close friends over. I’ve always enjoyed being the center of attention, and I love making people laugh, so I was really looking forward to it. I planned some fun games and even prepared snacks and drinks.

One of our friends, let’s call her Sarah, is a bit quieter and tends to be more reserved in social situations. I’ve known her for years, but I often feel like she doesn’t contribute much to conversations, and she can be hard to read. I tend to take over the conversation, but I figured that’s just my personality—I like to keep things lively.

When the game night started, I began to dominate the discussions, telling jokes and stories, and I noticed that Sarah was just sitting there, not really engaging. I thought it would be funny to poke fun at her lack of involvement, so I started making jokes at her expense, calling her things like “the wallflower” and “the quiet one.” I thought everyone would laugh, and some of our friends did, but I noticed Sarah seemed really uncomfortable.

Eventually, she tried to join in with a comment about one of the games, and I immediately interrupted her, making another joke about how she finally found her voice. It got a few laughs, but she just looked more upset. After that, she left the room for a bit and when she came back, she was noticeably quieter.

After the game night ended, Sarah sent me a message saying she felt hurt by my jokes and that I had embarrassed her. I brushed it off, thinking she was being too sensitive and that it was all in good fun. I explained that I was just trying to lighten the mood and that she needed to relax more.

Now, I’m starting to wonder if I went too far. I wanted everyone to have a good time, but maybe I took it too far with Sarah. AITA?",216,1079,0.69,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_36404,2024-02-25 00:00:00,YTA,1823,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I'm a 28-year-old man, and I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend, Sarah, for about two years. Sarah has a younger brother, Jake, who is 18 and just graduated high school. He’s a good kid, but he’s been a bit lost lately, trying to figure out what he wants to do next. 

Recently, Sarah and I had a weekend trip planned to go hiking with some friends, and Jake asked if he could join us. I was taken aback because I thought this was a couple's getaway, but I didn't want to be the bad guy, so I reluctantly agreed. The trip turned out to be a blast, but Jake was overly enthusiastic about joining in on everything, which started to get on my nerves.

On the last night of the trip, we all gathered around the campfire for some drinks and stories. Jake, trying to impress Sarah and her friends, started telling some embarrassing stories about his childhood and how he always looked up to me. In an attempt to be funny and lighten the mood, I decided to roast him a bit. I made a few jokes at his expense, which I thought were harmless and humorous, but Sarah wasn’t laughing. She looked visibly upset and told me that I was being a jerk. I brushed it off, thinking she was overreacting.

The next day, on the way home, Sarah confronted me about the jokes. She said that I crossed a line and that I should have respected Jake’s feelings, especially since he was feeling insecure about his future. I told her it was all in good fun, and she needed to lighten up. I honestly didn’t see what the big deal was. 

Now, Sarah has been giving me the cold shoulder since we got back, and I'm starting to feel like maybe I did mess up. I talked to a friend about it, and he said I was being an asshole for not recognizing that Jake was just trying to fit in and that my comments might have hurt him.

Last weekend, I was having a small gathering at my apartment with a few friends. We were all enjoying some drinks, playing games, and having a good time. One of my friends, Alex, brought along a new girl he had been dating, Sarah. I hadn’t met her before, but she seemed nice enough and was fitting in well with our group.

As the night went on, we decided to play a game that involved sharing embarrassing stories. When it was Sarah’s turn, she shared a story about how she once accidentally sent a very personal message to the wrong group chat, which included her parents. It was funny, and everyone laughed, but I could tell she was a bit embarrassed.

I thought it would be funny to poke fun a little, so I jokingly said, “Well, at least it wasn’t a nude, right?” Everyone laughed, but I noticed Sarah's face dropped a bit. She seemed genuinely uncomfortable, and I immediately felt bad. Instead of backing off, I doubled down and said, “Come on, it would have been hilarious if it was! You’d have a great story for the rest of your life!” 

The mood shifted, and Sarah quickly excused herself to go to the bathroom. I felt the vibe change in the room, and some of my friends looked at me like I had crossed a line. When Sarah came back, she seemed quieter than before, and the fun kind of fizzled out after that. Alex, her boyfriend, later pulled me aside and told me I should have been more considerate, that I made Sarah feel uncomfortable.

I brushed it off at first, thinking it was just a joke and that I was being too hard on myself. But now, I’m starting to wonder if I really was the asshole in this situation.

Last month, Mia invited me to a small gathering to celebrate her engagement with family and close friends. I was really excited, but then I found out that Jake’s parents were also invited. I had never met them, and I had heard mixed things about them from Mia. She told me that they weren’t very supportive of her and Jake’s relationship and had tried to convince him to break up with her in the past. I was concerned about Jake’s parents being there and how they might undermine the celebration.

When the day of the gathering arrived, everything was going well until I noticed Jake’s parents making snide comments about Mia’s choice of dress and the way they had planned the engagement party. I felt my blood boil and decided to intervene. I stood up and made a speech, expressing my excitement for Mia and Jake, but then I turned to Jake’s parents and said something like, ""It’s a shame that some parents can’t support their children’s happiness,"" while glaring at them.

Mia looked mortified, and Jake’s parents were visibly upset. After my speech, Mia pulled me aside and told me that I had embarrassed her and ruined the night. I thought I was standing up for her, but she said that I should have kept my mouth shut and let her handle her relationship with Jake’s family. A few days later, she told me that Jake’s parents had cut off contact with them after my outburst, which put a strain on their relationship.

Last weekend, my girlfriend was throwing a small birthday party for one of her friends at our apartment. I offered to help set up and clean up, but she insisted that I could just stay out of the way while they enjoyed their time. I tried to be understanding, but I felt a little hurt and rejected.

During the party, I decided to join in and jokingly said, “It’s nice to see you guys having fun without me.” I thought it would break the ice and make everyone laugh, but my girlfriend looked visibly upset. She pulled me aside and told me that my comment was out of line and that I shouldn’t intrude on their space like that.

I brushed it off, thinking I was just trying to be funny, but later in the night, she confronted me again, saying that I made the atmosphere uncomfortable. I ended up getting defensive and told her she was overreacting, that it was just a joke, and that she shouldn’t take things so seriously.

However, instead of being supportive, I ended up dominating the conversation with my own stories and advice. I talked for over an hour about my struggles and how I’ve coped, and I could see her getting more and more quiet. At one point, she tried to interject and say something, but I just brushed it off and continued talking.

Afterward, she seemed really withdrawn, and I thought maybe she just needed some space. A few days later, she texted me saying she appreciated my help but felt like I didn’t really listen to her. I responded by saying I was just trying to support her and that she should be grateful for my advice.

You're the Asshole,"I’m hoping to get some perspective on a situation that seems to have spiraled out of control. I’m definitely feeling some guilt over it, but I’m trying to understand if I’m in the wrong here.

So, I’m in my late 30s and work as a freelance graphic designer. My best friend, Jake, who I've known since college, recently started a new job in a corporate office. He’s been pretty stressed out because he’s trying to impress his new boss and get ahead. I totally get it; starting a new job can be daunting.

A couple of weekends ago, Jake invited me over for a small gathering with a few of his other friends. I was excited to see him and catch up, but I also knew he had been feeling a lot of pressure. During the gathering, a few of us were talking about work, and Jake was sharing his struggles with the new job. I thought it would be a good opportunity to lighten the mood, so I made a joke about how corporate jobs suck the soul out of you.

Unfortunately, I ended up taking it too far. I started mocking the office culture and the way his boss dresses, saying things like, “I bet they have a ‘fun’ dress code that includes pastel polo shirts and khaki pants.” I thought it was all in good fun, but I could see Jake getting visibly uncomfortable. He eventually told me to knock it off, but instead, I doubled down and made a couple more jokes. The laughter stopped, and I could feel the tension in the room.

After that, the atmosphere shifted, and Jake ended up leaving the room. A few of his other friends tried to comfort him, and I felt a bit deflated. I later texted Jake to apologize, but I could tell he was still upset. I thought I was just trying to bring some humor to a stressful situation, but now I’m feeling like the worst friend ever.

My other friends are divided; some think I was just trying to be funny and lighten the mood, while others believe I crossed a line and should’ve been more supportive. I keep replaying the situation in my head, wondering if I should have been more empathetic rather than trying to make jokes at his expense.

I (26F) have a best friend, Sarah (27F), who has been in a long-term relationship with her boyfriend, Jake (28M). They’ve been together for about five years. I love both of them dearly, but I have a tendency to be pretty protective of Sarah, especially when it comes to her emotional well-being.

Recently, I noticed that Jake had been making comments about Sarah’s appearance that seemed a bit off to me. For example, he would jokingly call her “lazy” for not dressing up for every outing, or he would casually mention how he preferred her hair styled a certain way. I felt that these comments could be damaging, so I decided to talk to Sarah about it.

When I brought it up, I was pretty intense. I told her that I think Jake doesn’t appreciate her like she deserves and that I think she could do better. I insisted that she should have higher standards in her relationship and really pushed her to reconsider if Jake was the right guy for her. I even suggested that maybe she should take a break from him to see if she could find someone who treats her better.

Sarah was really upset by my comments. She told me that she loves Jake and that he supports her in ways I don’t see. She said I was being overbearing and that I should trust her judgment. I didn’t back down, though. I kept insisting that I was just looking out for her and that I was trying to protect her from someone who I thought was not good enough for her.

You're the Asshole,"I (28F) recently had a big fallout with my younger sister (24F), which has left me questioning whether I was in the wrong.

Growing up, my sister and I had a pretty close relationship, but we’ve drifted apart a bit since she started dating her current boyfriend about a year ago. He has a very different lifestyle than what we grew up with, and I often worry that he’s a bad influence on her. I’ve voiced my concerns to her a few times, but she always brushes me off.

A couple of weeks ago, my sister invited me to her birthday party, which she was hosting at her boyfriend’s apartment.

I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable, especially since I knew her boyfriend’s friends had a reputation for partying hard.

As the night went on, I noticed her boyfriend getting more and more drunk. At one point, he started making some inappropriate jokes that I thought were disrespectful, especially since my sister was right there laughing along. So in a moment of frustration, I confronted him in front of everyone, saying something like, “You should really tone it down. This is supposed to be a celebration, not a frat party.” 

The atmosphere immediately shifted, and my sister looked mortified. She told me to stop ruining her birthday and that I was being embarrassing. I got defensive and pointed out that I was just looking out for her. After that, I decided to leave the party, feeling hurt and misunderstood.

Since then, my sister has barely spoken to me. She’s told me that I embarrassed her in front of her friends and that I shouldn’t have interfered in her relationship. I truly believed I was just trying to protect her, but now I'm left feeling guilty about how things turned out.

I ended up telling him that no one should be celebrated for being a mediocre parent, especially someone who has always had a negative impact on their child's life. I even suggested that he should stop enabling her behavior by throwing her a party. 

Sam was hurt by my words and tried to defend his mom, saying that she’s done her best considering the circumstances.

So, a little backstory: I’ve been friends with Jamie for about five years, and we’ve always been close. Recently, Jamie got a promotion at work, which is a huge deal for him, and he invited a small group of friends to celebrate. I was one of the invited guests, and to be honest, I was a bit jealous. I feel like I’ve been working hard too, but I’m still stuck in a dead-end job while Jamie is moving up the ladder.

At the party, everyone was congratulating him, and the atmosphere was really positive. But I found it hard to be genuinely happy for him. Instead, I started making snarky comments about how he was only getting ahead because of luck and that he wouldn’t survive in a more challenging environment. I thought I was just joking, but I could see Jamie starting to look uncomfortable.

Eventually, I ended up making a comment about how his new fancy title didn’t change the fact that he was still the same person I met five years ago, which felt really cruel. A few friends told me to chill out and that I was being a downer, but I kept going. I didn't want to let it go; I felt the need to point out what I saw as hypocrisy in his celebration.

After the party, Jamie texted me saying he felt hurt by my comments and didn’t expect that kind of behavior from a friend. I brushed it off and told him to lighten up, that it was all in good fun. But now, I’m starting to wonder if I crossed a line.

My friend Tom then asked if I thought Sarah’s baking was unhealthy, and I joked, “Well, it’s all sugar and butter, so yeah, I guess you could say it’s unhealthy, but it’s her thing, and I love her for it.” I went on to say that while I appreciated her efforts, I sometimes wished she’d focus on healthier recipes since I was trying to stay fit.

Later that week, Sarah and I were having dinner, and she asked about my game night. I casually mentioned that we joked about her baking and how I said I wished she would bake healthier things. She immediately got upset and said that it felt like I was criticizing her passion for baking. I thought it was no big deal, so I brushed it off and said, “I was just joking; you know I love you and appreciate what you do.”

Sarah didn’t take it well and accused me of being insensitive and not valuing her efforts. I tried to defend myself by saying that I’m just trying to be healthy and thought she could understand that. I also pointed out that I never actually said her baking was bad, just that I preferred healthier options.

The tension between us grew after that. She told me that I should be more supportive of her hobbies instead of making jokes about them, especially in front of my friends. I thought she was overreacting and that I didn’t really need to apologize since I meant no harm. Now she’s been distant, and I feel like I can’t even bring up the topic of food or baking without her getting defensive. 

I genuinely don’t think I did anything wrong; I was just being honest. AITA?",85,1961,0.68,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_10325,2019-11-13 00:00:00,YTA,2001,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I work in a small office with a team of five people. We recently had a company-wide meeting where our manager announced that there would be a bonus for everyone based on performance. The bonus would be given at the end of the quarter, and the manager encouraged us to support each other and work collaboratively.

One of my coworkers, Sarah, had been struggling with her workload. She was overwhelmed and often asked for help, which the rest of us were happy to provide. However, I noticed that Sarah was not pulling her weight on our group project. She would often miss deadlines and leave most of the work to the rest of us.

During a team lunch, I jokingly said, “At this rate, I might have to remind our manager that Sarah hasn’t contributed enough to deserve a bonus.” I thought it would be taken lightly, but Sarah’s face dropped, and she looked really hurt. The atmosphere turned awkward, but I laughed it off and continued eating.

Later, I overheard Sarah talking to another coworker about how my comment had upset her. I felt a bit guilty but also thought that maybe she needed a wake-up call about her performance. After all, I was only being honest about the situation.

AITA for joking about Sarah not deserving a bonus? I was just trying to lighten the mood, and I thought she needed to hear the truth about her performance.",645,2668,0.91,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_40348,2024-08-11 00:00:00,YTA,1338,AITA
You're the Asshole,"So, I recently attended a family gathering where my younger cousin was celebrating her 10th birthday. She was super excited, and everyone was there to celebrate her special day. As part of the festivities, my aunt had organized a small talent show where the kids could showcase their skills. 

My cousin loves to sing, and she had prepared a song to perform for everyone. When it was her turn, she got up on stage, and I could see how nervous she was. Instead of cheering her on, I couldn't help but roll my eyes and mutter to my partner, “She’s not even that good; why does everyone make a big deal about kids singing?” I thought I was just being honest about my feelings, but it turns out my comments were heard by some of the other family members. 

After she finished singing, there was a round of applause, and everyone was really supportive, which made me feel even more annoyed. I ended up making a sarcastic comment about how “we should all get a participation trophy for this” out loud. My cousin looked visibly hurt, and my aunt glared at me for ruining the moment.

Later, my family talked to me about how I should have just kept my opinions to myself and supported my cousin instead of tearing her down.

A few months ago, I decided to surprise Emma with a wedding gift: a beautiful, custom-made wedding planner that I had designed just for her. It was a thoughtful gesture, and I was excited to give it to her. I even included a heartfelt note expressing how much I love her and how I can't wait to see her happy on her special day.

Last week, Emma told me that she and Jake had picked a date for their wedding. She was ecstatic and shared all her plans with me. As we were chatting, she casually mentioned that she was thinking of using my wedding planner. I immediately felt a surge of irritation. I told her that I didn’t think it was a good idea because I had specifically designed it for her, and I didn't want her to feel like she was just using something that was meant for me.

Emma looked taken aback and said she just thought it was a nice gesture that I would want to share something special with her. I didn’t want to hurt her feelings, but I insisted that she should find something that reflects her own style and not just use mine. I told her it felt like I would be giving up a piece of my own wedding to let her use it.

The conversation got a bit heated, and Emma ended up getting upset and saying I was being selfish. I felt justified in wanting to keep my planner personal, but now I can’t help but wonder if I overreacted. Maybe I should have just let her use it and figured it out later.

You're the Asshole,"This past weekend, my best friend threw a big birthday party to celebrate her 30th. She went all out with decorations, a catered dinner, and even hired a DJ. I was really excited to celebrate with her, and I knew a lot of the guests since we all grew up together.

Leading up to the party, I had been feeling a little off about my own finances—money has been tight lately, and I wasn't sure I could afford to buy a big gift. I did decide to get her a nice card and a small gift, but it wasn’t anything extravagant. I thought I could also help out a bit by bringing some snacks and drinks to the party.

The night of the party came, and I arrived a bit late because I had to work late. When I walked in, I immediately noticed that everyone else had brought really nice gifts—designer handbags, expensive bottles of wine, and even a piece of art. I felt pretty embarrassed about my small offering, but I tried to brush it off and enjoy the night.

As the night went on, the DJ started playing some music, and people began to dance. My friend looked incredible, and I was genuinely happy for her, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of inadequacy. When it was time for her to open gifts, I felt even more anxious. 

When it was my turn, she opened my gift, smiled politely, and thanked me, but I could tell she was a bit disappointed. I couldn’t help but feel that my small gesture didn’t measure up to what others had given. In a moment of frustration, I jokingly said, “Well, at least I brought snacks!” This led to some awkward laughter, but I could see that my friend’s smile faded a bit.

Later in the evening, I overheard her talking to another friend about how she was surprised that some people didn’t put in more effort for her birthday. I felt a bit defensive and decided to say something to her face. I approached her and said, “Not everyone can afford to give you what they wish they could, you know. You should be grateful for what you get.” 

My friend looked shocked and hurt, and she said that it was unfair for me to say that when she just wanted everyone to enjoy the celebration. I realized I had overstepped, but I was too proud to apologize then. I left the party feeling justified, but now I'm wondering if I crossed a line.

However, I noticed that one of our mutual friends, Jess, was wearing a dress that I had worn to a different event a few months ago. It was a dress I love and thought I looked good in, so I felt a bit possessive about it.

During the party, I made a comment to Jess, jokingly saying, ""Wow, nice dress! I hope you didn’t steal it from me!"" I thought it would be funny, but Jess didn't laugh. Instead, she looked a bit uncomfortable, and I could tell that it bothered her. At that point, I shrugged it off, thinking she was being overly sensitive.

Later in the night, I brought it up again with a few other friends, saying something like, ""Isn't it funny that Jess is wearing my dress?"" I thought it was all in good fun, but Jess just ended up leaving the party early. Afterward, my friend whose birthday it was texted me, saying that I should probably apologize to Jess for making her feel bad.

We were all happy for her, but I could tell she was feeling anxious about starting at a new place. I decided that for our next game night, I would throw a little celebration for her to help her feel more at ease. I organized a surprise party at my place with snacks, decorations, and a small cake.

However, when game night arrived, Sarah walked in and seemed a bit overwhelmed by the surprise. She smiled, but I could see she wasn’t fully comfortable. As the night went on, she appeared to be struggling to engage with everyone and just looked a bit lost in thought. When she finally spoke up, she mentioned that she was really grateful for the gesture but that she was feeling stressed about her new job and just wanted to keep things low-key for the evening.

I felt frustrated because I had put so much effort into making the night special for her. In the heat of the moment, I snapped and said something like, “Well, sorry for trying to celebrate you! Not everyone has to be so serious all the time.” I could see her face fall, and it made me feel bad, but I was also annoyed that she wasn't enjoying the party I planned.

After that, the atmosphere shifted, and other friends started to get awkward. I tried to lighten the mood, but it didn’t really work. By the end of the night, I felt like I had ruined the celebration, and I was still mad at Sarah for not appreciating what I had done.

Later, my friends told me that I overreacted and that I should have been more understanding of Sarah’s feelings, especially since it was a stressful time for her.

You're the Asshole,"I (30F) have a younger brother (25M) who has always had a passion for music. Ever since he was a kid, he wanted to be a musician, but my parents were very practical and always encouraged him to pursue a ""real"" job instead. After years of him studying and working in various corporate roles, he finally decided to quit his steady job and focus on his music full-time. While I was supportive, I also expressed my concerns about him being able to support himself and pay his bills.

Fast forward a year, and my brother is still struggling to make it as a musician. He plays gigs here and there, but it's not enough to cover his living expenses. Recently, I found out that he’s been spending a lot of his meager savings on fancy music equipment, thinking it will help him ""make it big."" I felt that this was irresponsible, so I decided to step in.

During our last family dinner, I confronted him about his spending habits. I told him that he needed to be realistic and stop wasting money on unnecessary gear when he can barely afford rent. I suggested he sell some of his equipment to help pay his bills and even offered to help him find side jobs that align better with his music career.

My brother was visibly hurt and defensive. He said he didn’t want to compromise his passion for music by treating it like a hobby. I insisted that I was just trying to help him be more responsible and that he should listen to someone who’s ""actually"" been through the grind of adult life.

After the dinner, my brother told me that I was being condescending and that I didn't understand how much music meant to him. I brushed it off and thought I was just being practical. I even mentioned that if he really wanted to make music a career, he should be prepared to face some harsh realities and be more financially responsible.

Among them was my best friend, Mike (31M), who has been in a serious relationship with his girlfriend, Sarah (29F), for about a year. They're both really great people, and I was happy to have them over.

During the dinner, the conversation turned to future plans and family. Sarah mentioned how she’s always wanted a big family and hopes to have three kids someday. Mike, usually the supportive boyfriend, just smiled and nodded but didn't say much. I could tell he was a bit uncomfortable, but I thought he just didn’t want to share his thoughts in front of everyone.

For some reason, I decided to poke fun at Mike. I said something like, ""Well, Mike, if you keep dragging your feet on proposing, you might miss your chance at that big family!"" Everyone laughed, but I noticed Mike's smile faded a bit. I didn’t think much of it at the time and kept joking about how he should hurry up.

Later that night, Sarah pulled me aside and told me that she had been hinting at wanting to get engaged soon and that my comments were kind of putting pressure on Mike. I brushed it off and told her I was just joking, that it was all in good fun. I didn’t see the harm in it, and I thought she was overreacting.

During dinner, we were all having a great time, laughing and sharing stories. A couple of drinks in, I started getting a bit loud and animated. At one point, I told a pretty raunchy joke that involved some explicit content. I thought it was hilarious, but I didn't notice that the table next to us had a family with young children.

After my joke, the father from the next table approached me and asked me to keep my language down, especially since there were kids around. I rolled my eyes and told him to lighten up, that it was just a joke. I even added that it's a free country and I can say what I want. My friends laughed and encouraged me to keep going, so I started making even more inappropriate jokes.

This time, though, I was feeling particularly stressed about the whole thing, and I ended up taking control of most of the planning. I didn't mean to, but I just kept making decisions without really consulting her.

Sarah had some ideas about decorations and themes that I dismissed because I thought they were too childish. I even told her I didn’t want to do a “silly” theme and insisted on a more sophisticated vibe. When she tried to suggest some fun games to play during the party, I shot those down too, saying they wouldn’t appeal to our friends.

On the day of the party, things got tense. I was setting everything up and didn’t really pay attention to her input.

Some context first: I have a younger brother, Jake, who just turned 18 and recently graduated from high school. He’s always been kind of shy and has had a tough time making friends, but he finally found a group of people he gets along with. 

Last weekend, my parents organized a small get-together to celebrate Jake's birthday. They invited family and a few of his new friends, and I was asked to help with the food and drinks. I was in charge of the music, and since we have a pretty big age gap, I didn’t really know what he and his friends liked. I thought it would be fun to play some of my favorite upbeat songs from when I was in college, so I created a playlist.

The party started, and everyone seemed to be having a good time, but I noticed that Jake’s friends were looking a bit uncomfortable. They were whispering to each other and giving me weird looks. I thought maybe they just weren’t used to having an older sibling around, so I kept the music going.

At one point, I played a song that I loved, but I could see Jake’s face change. He seemed really embarrassed and asked me to turn it off. I jokingly said, “Come on, it’s a classic!” and kept it playing. I thought I was being funny, but I noticed that Jake looked visibly upset. His friends started to leave, and I felt kind of confused about why they were leaving early.

Later, Jake pulled me aside and told me that my choice of music was really cringy to him and his friends. He said they were trying to enjoy themselves, but I was making it awkward. I brushed it off and said he was being too sensitive. I ended up texting some of my friends about the situation, joking that my brother was embarrassed of me.

After I set it up, I invited everyone to play. Sarah seemed really interested and asked if she could try it out. I said sure, but then I jokingly added that I couldn't let her borrow it because she always breaks my stuff. We all laughed, but later in the night, I noticed she seemed a bit hurt by my comment.

A few months ago, I was hanging out with Jake and he casually mentioned that Emily had been struggling with her self-esteem lately. He said she was considering doing some modeling work to boost her confidence and earn a little extra money. I didn’t think much of it at the time.

The problem is, I couldn’t help but think about how Jake would feel about it. I decided to talk to him about it. I mentioned that I saw Emily’s modeling pictures and asked if he was okay with it. He seemed taken aback and said he was really uncomfortable with the idea of her being exposed to strangers like that. I didn’t really get why he was upset, so I jokingly said, “Come on, man, it’s just modeling! She’s hot and should own it!”

When I arrived, I noticed that he had invited a lot of people, including some friends of his who I’m not particularly fond of.

I told them they were ruining the party and that they should just go home if they couldn't be nice to Tom.

Tom looked really uncomfortable and tried to defend his friends, saying they were just joking around. I didn’t think that was fair and told him he needed to stand up for himself instead of letting them walk all over him. I even went so far as to say that if he wanted to keep these “so-called friends” in his life, we probably wouldn’t be friends much longer.

After that, the atmosphere shifted dramatically. People started to leave, and Tom was obviously upset.

You're the Asshole,"I (28M) recently had a big falling out with my best friend, Jake (29M). We've been friends since college, and I really value our friendship. However, I've noticed lately that Jake has been feeling really down about his job and life in general. He talks about it all the time—how he's stuck in a dead-end job, how he feels like he isn’t living up to his potential, and all the things he wishes he could change.

Last week, we planned a night out for drinks to celebrate his birthday. I was really looking forward to it, thinking it would be a great chance for him to unwind and have some fun. But as soon as we sat down, he started in on his job struggles again. I tried to steer the conversation toward something more positive, like the new restaurant we were at or our favorite sports team, but he kept bringing it back to his work issues.

After about an hour of this, I lost my patience. I snapped at him and said, ""Dude, it’s your birthday! Can we just have one night without you complaining about your job? It’s getting old!"" He looked really hurt, and I immediately felt terrible. He ended up leaving the bar early, and I haven’t heard from him since.

I’ve been reflecting on my reaction, and I really don’t think I should have lost my cool. I get that he’s struggling, but I feel like I shouldn’t have to endure the same complaints every time we hang out. Maybe I should have just let him vent instead of being so harsh. 

Am I the asshole for telling my best friend to stop complaining about his life on his birthday?",736,2543,0.51,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_61862,2019-02-17 00:00:00,YTA,1526,AITA
You're the Asshole,"My friend recently opened a small bakery, and I was really excited for her. I offered to help her with the grand opening, and she accepted my help to set up and bake some goods. The day of the opening, I decided to showcase my own baking skills and brought along a batch of my famous cookies, thinking it would be a nice surprise for her and a way to draw in more customers.

However, when I arrived, I noticed that she had already prepared a lot of baked goods and was really proud of her creations. I didn’t think much of it and just set my cookies on the table alongside hers. As the day went on, I noticed that people were more drawn to my cookies than hers, and it made me feel a bit smug.

After the event, she pulled me aside and told me that while she appreciated my effort, she felt overshadowed by my cookies and that it was her big day. I brushed it off and told her that it’s just business and that people prefer what they like. I even joked that maybe she should take notes on how to bake better cookies.

Now, I’m reflecting on the situation, and I feel like maybe I overstepped. I thought I was helping, but I didn’t consider how it might affect her on such an important day.

You're the Asshole,"So, this happened a few weeks ago, and it’s still bothering me. I (28M) recently got into a new relationship with a girl named Sarah (26F). We've been dating for about three months, and things have been going really well. Sarah is really sweet, and I feel a strong connection with her.

A couple of weeks ago, I decided to throw a small get-together at my apartment with a few friends, including Sarah. It was meant to be a fun night with some drinks and games. I invited some of my close friends, but I also invited my ex-girlfriend, Jenna (27F), who I’ve remained friends with after our breakup. Jenna and I broke up on good terms about a year ago, and we still hang out occasionally.

I didn’t think much of it and didn’t mention to Sarah that Jenna would be there. I just assumed she would be fine because, after all, my relationship with Jenna is strictly platonic. When Sarah arrived and saw Jenna there, she looked really uncomfortable. I thought it would blow over, but as the night went on, Sarah became increasingly distant and ended up leaving early.

Later, Sarah texted me that she felt disrespected and hurt that I didn’t tell her I was inviting my ex. She said that it made her feel insecure, and I should have considered her feelings. I was surprised because I didn’t think it was a big deal. I honestly just wanted everyone to have a good time together. 

Now, I feel like I might have messed up. I didn’t think I needed to disclose my ex's presence since we have history, and I believed it was all in good fun. But maybe I should have been more thoughtful about Sarah’s feelings.

I've always been the overachiever in the family—got good grades, a stable job, and I’ve traveled a lot. My sister, on the other hand, has always been more laid-back and has taken her time figuring things out. 

When she announced her engagement, I felt like everyone was praising her while downplaying my accomplishments. It bothered me a lot, and I started making snarky comments at family gatherings about how getting engaged isn’t that big of a deal compared to, say, earning a degree or traveling solo around Europe. I thought I was just being honest, but my family started to pull me aside and tell me I was being negative and unsupportive.

The final straw was at her engagement party. Instead of just congratulating her, I made a speech where I compared her getting engaged to my achievements, saying things like, “Some of us strive for more than just a ring.” I thought I was being funny, but everyone went silent, and my sister looked devastated. 

Now my family is upset with me, and I’m starting to feel guilty.

At one point, I noticed that the bride's sister (28F) was sitting at a table looking upset. I knew she had been dealing with some personal issues, so I decided to go over and see if she wanted to talk or join in on the fun.

When I approached her, I asked, ""Hey, why are you sitting here all alone? Come on, it's a party!"" She looked up at me with tears in her eyes, and I could tell she was overwhelmed. Instead of being sensitive, I laughed and said, ""Don't be such a downer! It's her wedding day! You have to be happy!"" I then tried to pull her up to dance with me.

She just shook her head and said she wasn’t in the mood, which really annoyed me. I rolled my eyes and said, ""Fine, but don't ruin it for everyone else."" I walked away and continued dancing, but I could see her looking hurt.

Later on, my friend (the bride) pulled me aside and said that the sister had been going through a tough time and really needed support, and my comments had come off as really insensitive.

You're the Asshole,"A few weeks ago, I was attending a friend's birthday party. It was a small gathering, and everyone was having a good time. During the party, the topic of conversation shifted to people's aspirations and dreams. One of the guests, who I barely knew, shared that she had always wanted to become a professional dancer but felt discouraged because she had been told she wasn't talented enough.

In a moment of thoughtlessness, I chimed in with something like, ""Honestly, if you really wanted to dance, you should have started when you were younger. It's too late now."" I thought I was just being honest, but the room fell silent and the girl looked visibly hurt. My friend, the birthday girl, shot me a surprised look, and I realized I had overstepped.

I didn’t think it was a big deal at the time, but since then, I've noticed that people seem to be more distant with me.

A few days later, I reached out to the birthday girl to ask if she was okay. She said she appreciated my concern but also mentioned that my comment had really upset her friend. Instead of being understanding, I got defensive and told her that I was just speaking the truth and that people need to learn to accept it.

Recently, my roommate decided to start practicing yoga at home. She’s really into it and has been doing it almost every morning. That’s great and all, but the thing is, she’s been doing it in the living room, which is also where I usually hang out and watch TV or play video games. 

I came home from work one day, and she was in the middle of her routine wearing some really tight and revealing workout clothes. I guess I'm just not comfortable with that, especially since we share the space. I told her that I felt awkward seeing her like that, and I asked if she could maybe do her yoga in her room instead. She got pretty upset and said that she feels more relaxed and free doing it in the living room, and that she shouldn't have to hide because I'm uncomfortable.

I tried to explain my point of view, but she thought I was being controlling and that I should just let her be comfortable in her own home. Honestly, I didn't mean to make her feel bad, but I just don’t want to see that every day when I get home.

However, I have a bit of a habit that I didn't think would be a big deal: I like to play video games late into the night, often until 2 or 3 AM.

My girlfriend has a pretty demanding job and needs her sleep, so I know my late-night gaming sessions sometimes wake her up. I've tried to keep the volume low and wear headphones, but sometimes I get a little too into the game and end up yelling or getting really animated. 

A few weeks ago, she asked me to try to wrap up my gaming by midnight on weekdays, but I didn’t take her request seriously. I figured it was just a suggestion and that I would still be considerate enough by using headphones. So, I continued gaming late, thinking it wouldn’t be a big deal since I don’t do it every night.

Last night, I was playing a particularly intense match and ended up getting really loud. My girlfriend came out of the bedroom looking frustrated and told me that she needed to get some sleep for an important meeting the next day. I snapped at her, saying I was just having fun and that she needed to lighten up. 

In the heat of the moment, I told her that my gaming was just as important as her job and that she should have chosen a quieter partner if she wanted peace at night.

However, here are the issues:

1. The party starts at 1 PM and ends at 5 PM, but my sister is not great at managing her time. I’ve caught her losing track of time during playdates before, and I’m worried she won’t be able to find her friends or get to the meeting point when it’s time to leave.

2. The invitation mentions that parents are welcome to stay, but my sister is insisting that I drop her off and leave. She says she wants to be independent and hang out with her friends without me hovering around. I get that she’s trying to assert her independence, but I’m uncomfortable with the idea of her being on her own in a big amusement park.

3. The park is a 30-minute drive away, and I have other obligations that day. I really don’t want to spend the entire day there, especially since I could use that time to catch up on work.

So, I told her that she can’t go unless I stay with her. She was really upset and said I was being overprotective and embarrassing. She argued that all the other kids would be there without their parents, and I should trust her to handle herself.

You're the Asshole,"My friend Jamie has been working on getting her art business off the ground for a few months now. She’s always loved painting, but it’s been a struggle for her to find clients and get her work out there. I've been painting for years and have a decent following on social media, so I thought I’d help her out. I offered to promote her work on my social media accounts and let her use my studio space to create.

The first time we worked together, I noticed she was using cheap materials that I knew wouldn’t do her any favors. I suggested she invest a bit more in her supplies since better materials could really enhance her art. She laughed it off and said she liked using what she had because it was more comfortable for her. I insisted that if she wanted to be taken seriously as an artist, she needed to make some sacrifices and invest in herself.

As we continued to work together, I kept giving her unsolicited advice on everything – from her technique to her pricing. I would often interrupt her when she was in the zone, pointing out flaws in her work or suggesting she change her style to match current trends. I thought I was helping, but Jamie started to get visibly frustrated. She told me she felt like I was stifling her creativity and that she wanted to discover her own style without my constant interference.

I brushed it off and told her that I was just trying to help her succeed. I couldn’t understand why she wouldn’t appreciate my input, especially since I had more experience. One day, after I critiqued a piece she was really proud of, she snapped and said that she didn’t need a “second-guessing coach” and that I should trust her artistic vision. I got defensive and told her that she was being ungrateful for all the help I was offering.

After that, things got really tense. I decided that I wouldn’t promote her work anymore, and I stopped inviting her to my studio. I told her if she didn’t want to listen to my advice, then she was on her own. She seemed really hurt, and I didn’t understand why she was taking it so personally.

TL;DR: I tried to help my friend Jamie with her art business by giving her constant advice and critiques.

Growing up, we were always very competitive; whether it was academics, sports, or even video games, we pushed each other to be better. Jake was always the golden child in my parents’ eyes, and they often praised him for his accomplishments. I graduated college with a decent GPA, but Jake graduated with honors and received a full scholarship to a prestigious university. 

Recently, I got a promotion at my job, and I was really excited to celebrate this achievement. I invited my family over for a small dinner party, hoping for a nice evening. During the dinner, I shared the news about my promotion, expecting my parents to be proud and supportive. Instead, they shifted the conversation to Jake, as he had just finished his semester and was preparing for a summer internship. 

Feeling overlooked and frustrated, I made a sarcastic comment about how it seems like Jake can’t go a minute without being the center of attention. My family laughed it off, but I continued to belittle Jake’s accomplishments, saying things like, “Yeah, good for you, but some of us actually have to work hard for our success.” I can tell I hurt Jake's feelings, as he seemed visibly upset.

After that night, my parents confronted me, saying I was being rude and that I should be happy for my brother instead of trying to bring him down. They reminded me that I should be proud of my own achievements without needing to compare them to Jake’s. I brushed it off, thinking they were just overly protective of him.

Now, I feel guilty because I realize I may have taken my own insecurities out on Jake. I’ve always felt like I was in his shadow, and instead of celebrating my success, I lashed out at him. My friends say I was in the wrong, but I thought I was just being honest about how I feel.

Recently, he decided to quit his job to pursue his dream of becoming a full-time musician, which I thought was a bit reckless given his financial situation. 

In the past, he had borrowed money from me a few times, and while I helped him out, it was always with the understanding that he’d pay me back once he got on his feet. He has yet to pay me back any of the money, and it’s been a source of tension between us. 

A couple of weeks ago, Jake asked if he could perform at my birthday party. I was excited to support him, so I agreed and invited my friends and family. However, the night before the party, he called me to tell me he wanted to change his set to include some explicit songs that were very much against my parents' taste. I asked him to keep it a bit more family-friendly, considering our parents would be there. He got really upset and accused me of not supporting his art. 

Instead of just letting it go, I made a passive-aggressive comment about how he should be able to handle that if he really wanted to be a professional musician.

I love shopping for baby stuff, so I’ve pretty much gone overboard with buying cute outfits and toys for my niece. The problem is, I’ve been buying a lot more than I probably should have. In fact, I’ve spent a few thousand dollars on baby-related things, and my sister has been thanking me, but I can tell she feels a bit overwhelmed by it.

I need to share what happened with my best friend (29), let's call her Lisa, and her boyfriend (31), Mark. They’ve been together for over three years, and they recently got engaged. I was really excited for them and was looking forward to the wedding.

A few weeks before the engagement announcement, I overheard a conversation between Lisa and another friend where she mentioned that she had cheated on Mark early in their relationship. She said it was a huge mistake, and they worked through it, but it stuck with me. Mark has always been such a great guy, and I knew he would be devastated if he found out.

When they announced their engagement, everyone was thrilled, but I couldn't shake the feeling that Mark deserved to know the truth about Lisa's past. So, I decided to approach Lisa privately. I told her that I thought she should come clean about the cheating, especially since they were about to get married. Lisa insisted that it was in the past and that they had moved on, but I didn't think that was enough.

I gave her an ultimatum: either she tells Mark about the cheating, or I would. She didn’t take it seriously and brushed me off, saying it was unnecessary. I felt like I was doing the right thing, so I took it upon myself to tell Mark.

I pulled him aside one day and told him everything I knew. Mark was completely blindsided. He thanked me for my honesty but was obviously heartbroken. He confronted Lisa, and they ended up having a huge fight. The engagement is now off, and Mark has told Lisa he needs space to figure things out. 

Now, my friends and family are really upset with me. They say I overstepped and ruined something beautiful. I feel like I did the right thing, but I also recognize that Lisa is suffering, and Mark is understandably hurt.

You're the Asshole,"I (28F) have a younger sister (24F) who just got engaged. I'm really happy for her, but I have to admit I've always been a bit envious of her for having a perfect relationship and everything just seems to fall into place for her. I had a pretty rough breakup a year ago, and I’m still struggling to move on.

When she announced her engagement, I decided to throw her an engagement party to celebrate. I put a lot of effort into planning everything, from the venue to the guest list, and I wanted it to be perfect. However, I also saw this as an opportunity to make myself look good in front of our family and friends, since I was feeling pretty down about my own life. 

During the party, I made a toast and ended up making it all about me. I started talking about how hard it has been for me since my breakup and how I’ve been feeling lonely. I could see my sister's face fall as I went on and on about my struggles. I completely overshadowed her moment. 

After the toast, I noticed that my sister was visibly upset. I thought she was just overwhelmed with emotions, so I brushed it off. Later that night, I overheard her talking to our mom about how I was selfish for making her engagement party focus on my issues instead of celebrating her. 

I felt defensive because I thought I was just being honest about my feelings, and that it was okay to share. I called her out for being overly sensitive and told her it wasn’t my fault if she couldn’t handle a little honesty. I even told her that maybe she should get used to sharing the spotlight since being married comes with its own challenges.

Now, I’m feeling guilty about how things turned out, but I really don’t think I was in the wrong for being honest. AITA for making my sister’s engagement party partly about me?",151,2761,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_53750,2018-07-04 00:00:00,YTA,1774,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I’m a 28-year-old woman, and I have a younger brother, Jake, who is 19. I’ve always been the more responsible sibling, and growing up, I often found myself taking care of him when our parents were busy with work or dealing with their issues. I was sort of a second mom to him, and while I loved him, I sometimes felt overwhelmed by the burden of responsibility.

A few months ago, Jake told me he wanted to take a gap year after high school to travel and explore. I thought this was a terrible idea. I worried he wouldn’t be able to handle it, that he’d waste his time and money, and I felt it was my duty to set him straight. So, I sat him down and laid out all the reasons why he shouldn’t do it. I told him he needed to go straight to college and that anything else would be a waste of his potential.

Jake was really upset. He told me he just wanted to have some experiences before settling down into a routine. I brushed off his feelings, insisting that I just wanted what was best for him. I even went so far as to threaten to stop supporting him if he chose to take the gap year. I have been helping him with his college applications, and I made it clear that I would withdraw my help if he didn’t follow my advice.

Things got worse between us. He stopped talking to me as much, and he began to confide in our parents instead. I felt betrayed and hurt that he wouldn’t listen to me, his own sister, and I couldn’t understand why he’d choose to ignore my guidance.

Finally, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I called one of his college friends and told them to talk to him about why taking a gap year was a bad idea. I thought maybe hearing it from someone else would make him see reason. When Jake found out, he was furious. He accused me of trying to control his life and said I was being a terrible sister. 

I don’t see how I did anything wrong. I was just trying to protect him from making a big mistake. I’m starting to wonder if I misjudged the situation. So, AITA for trying to steer my brother in the right direction?",171,2023,0.94,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_40892,2023-09-29 00:00:00,YTA,2045,AITA

I tried to brush it off, but it was getting under my skin. Eventually, I snapped and told her that if she didn't want to participate in the theme, she could leave. 

Things got awkward, and other friends chimed in, saying I was being overdramatic. Sarah ended up leaving in a huff, and I felt a bit bad afterward, but I thought she was being rude and not respecting my efforts.

One day, I invited a few buddies over for a casual get-together. We were just hanging out, playing some video games, and having a few drinks.

As the night went on, we got a bit loud but nothing too crazy, just laughing and joking around. At some point, I decided it would be a good idea to pull out my karaoke machine. I thought it would be fun to sing some classic songs and get everyone involved. So, I cranked up the volume and started singing. My friends joined in, and we were having a blast.

However, I didn't realize that my neighbor from the apartment next door was trying to study for an important exam the next day. After about an hour of karaoke, I heard a loud knock on the wall from their side. I took that as a sign that they weren't too happy about our noise, but instead of being considerate, I just laughed it off and kept singing even louder, thinking it was all in good fun.

Eventually, my neighbor came over and knocked on my door. They were clearly annoyed and asked if we could keep it down because they were trying to focus on their studies. I sarcastically responded, ""Come on, it's just a little karaoke! You should join us!"" They didn't find that funny and left, saying they would report me if we didn't stop.

I ended up ignoring their request, and we continued our party until late in the night. The next day, I received a notice from the apartment management about noise complaints. I felt annoyed because I didn't think we were being that disruptive. I just wanted to enjoy my time with friends.

But later that night, I couldn’t help myself – I ended up eating almost all of the cookies while binge-watching my favorite show. I felt a little guilty, but the cookies were just too good!

Recently, she got a promotion at work, and to celebrate, she wanted to throw a small party with her close friends. I didn’t mind at all, and I even helped her set up the place and prepare some snacks.

A couple of days before the party, she mentioned that her best friend from college would be coming, and I hadn’t met her yet. She told me that they had a really close bond and that she was excited for her to finally see our home. I thought that was great, and I made sure to prepare a nice dinner for everyone to enjoy.

The day of the party arrived, and everything was going smoothly. The guests were having a good time, and I was mingling with them, trying to make everyone feel welcome. At one point, I overheard my girlfriend talking to her friend about how some guy in their college group had proposed to his girlfriend in a really elaborate way, and she was gushing about it.

She told me that I had ruined the moment for her by making a joke about engagement when it was something she takes seriously. I told her I was just trying to lighten the mood and that I didn’t mean anything by it.

To help distract her, I suggested we all go out for dinner and drinks. I thought it would be a great way to lift her spirits. However, I didn't really think about her feelings. The night of the dinner, I noticed that Lisa was pretty quiet and didn’t seem to be enjoying herself. She kept staring at her food and was clearly not in the mood to celebrate.

Instead of being supportive, I started making jokes about how this was a ""cheat night"" and that we should all indulge ourselves. I even went so far as to order a massive dessert and say, “Come on, Lisa! You need to live a little! It’s not like you’re going to get any skinnier with all the crying!” My friend Sarah (26F) and I laughed, but Lisa just forced a smile.

When Lisa eventually excused herself to the restroom, I turned to the others and said, “Isn’t it kind of funny how she’s acting? She used to be the life of the party, and now she’s just moping around. I mean, it’s just a breakup! Get over it already!” I thought I was being lighthearted and funny, but I could see from their faces that the others were uncomfortable.

Recently, Jake got engaged to his girlfriend, and they decided to have a big wedding next summer. He asked me to be his maid of honor, and while I was happy for him, I also felt the pressure to step up in a way that felt daunting.

I thought about all the times he overshadowed me and how our parents never seemed to notice my accomplishments. In a moment of frustration, I blurted out that I might just tell the truth about how he was always the favorite and how I had to work twice as hard to get any recognition.

As everyone started to eat, it became clear that there wasn't enough pizza to go around.

Recently, she finished the latest book and was super excited about it. I, however, had read some online reviews that mentioned a plot twist that included a character death, which really upset me because I know how much my daughter loves that character.

So, without thinking too much, I told her about the character's death, thinking I was just being a good parent by giving her a heads-up so she wouldn't be blindsided.

You're the Asshole,"I recently moved into a new apartment and was excited to start fresh in a new community. My neighbors seemed nice enough, and I thought it would be great to get to know them. However, I quickly found out that one family in particular, the Johnsons, had a very active social life. They threw loud parties almost every weekend, which often went on until the early hours of the morning.

At first, I tried to be understanding. I even attended a couple of their gatherings and met some of their friends, but I soon realized that my lifestyle didn't mesh well with theirs. I enjoy quiet evenings and early mornings, so the loud music and raucous laughter became increasingly frustrating for me.

One night, after about three hours of nonstop noise, I had enough. Instead of talking to the Johnsons directly, I decided to call the police and complain about the noise. I felt justified in doing so, thinking that maybe a visit from the police would force them to acknowledge how disruptive they were being.

The police arrived, and while they were very polite, they simply warned the Johnsons to keep it down. Of course, this only made things worse; the Johnsons were upset and confronted me the next day. They expressed their frustration and said that I should have come to them directly instead of involving the police.

In hindsight, I realize that my actions were pretty selfish. Instead of fostering a good relationship with my neighbors, I escalated the situation and made things awkward.

You're the Asshole,"Last weekend, I hosted a small gathering at my apartment for a few friends. I had been looking forward to it all week and wanted everything to be perfect. To make it special, I decided to prepare a big batch of my famous homemade lasagna, which I know everyone loves. I spent the entire afternoon cooking and was really proud of how it turned out.

When my friends arrived, everyone was excited to dig in. I served the lasagna, and we all enjoyed it together. As the night went on, my friend Sarah mentioned that she was on a low-carb diet and couldn’t eat much pasta. Without thinking, I jokingly told her, ""Well, you should have thought about that before coming over!"" It was meant to be light-hearted, but I noticed she seemed a bit put off by my comment.

Later in the evening, when we were all done eating, I packed up the leftover lasagna to save for the week. As I was putting it away, I realized that I had made a lot more than I needed, but I didn’t think much of it. The next day, Sarah texted me saying she felt awkward about my comment and that she had wanted to try the lasagna, but didn’t want to go off her diet. I replied with something like, ""You should have just had a little! I don’t see what the big deal is.""

Now I feel bad because I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings, but I also think she could have just enjoyed the food like everyone else instead of fixating on her diet. I really value my friendships, but I can’t shake the feeling that she was being overly sensitive.

So, AITA for making a light-hearted joke and not being more considerate of Sarah's diet?",299,2170,0.75,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_25526,2021-08-03 00:00:00,YTA,1583,AITA
You're the Asshole,"Throwaway account.

I recently had a situation with my roommate that I feel really conflicted about. We've been living together for a few years, and I consider us to be good friends. However, I’ve noticed that she often leaves the common area a mess after she cooks. I’m talking about dirty dishes piled high in the sink, food crumbs all over the counter, and sometimes even spills on the floor. 

One day, I snapped. I was already stressed out with work and came home to find the kitchen in a state that I could hardly recognize. I ended up texting her, telling her that I was tired of cleaning up after her and that it was disrespectful to treat our shared space like that. I know it might have been a bit harsh, but I was really frustrated.

When she got home, she was clearly upset. She said that she didn’t think I was being fair, that everyone has their own style of cleaning, and that I should have just asked her to clean up instead of blowing up at her. I told her that I shouldn’t have to ask her to clean up after herself, and if she didn’t want to take responsibility for her messes, then maybe she shouldn’t be living with me.

Now, looking back, I feel like I could have approached it in a better way. I recognize that I was really rude, especially for someone I consider a friend. But I still believe that I had a point. AITA for how I handled it?",762,2313,0.62,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_82490,2022-03-10 00:00:00,YTA,1362,AITA

AITA for telling my friend she needs to lose weight?

I have a close friend, Sarah, who I've known for years. We used to be workout buddies, but over the past couple of years, she has gained quite a bit of weight and doesn’t seem to care about her health anymore. I’ve always been passionate about fitness and healthy living, and it frustrates me to see her ignore it.

Last weekend, we were hanging out, and she mentioned wanting to go on vacation to a tropical destination. I jokingly said, “You better lose some weight before you go, or you’ll be too self-conscious in a swimsuit!” I thought I was just being honest, but she got quiet and didn’t laugh. 

Later, she confronted me about it and said that my comment really hurt her feelings. I brushed it off, telling her that I was just looking out for her health. I thought if I was straightforward, it might motivate her to make some changes. I honestly didn’t mean to upset her; I just want what's best for her.

You're the Asshole,"I've always been a big fan of cooking and trying out new recipes. I love experimenting in the kitchen and have even published a few blog posts about my culinary adventures. My girlfriend, however, has a very different relationship with food. She's been open about her struggles with an eating disorder in the past, and while she's been doing better, she still has moments where certain foods can be triggers for her.

So, a week ago, I decided to host a dinner party for some friends, and I got really excited about trying out a new gourmet recipe I had been eyeing. It involved a lot of rich ingredients, and I thought it would impress everyone. I didn’t really think about how it might affect my girlfriend. I figured since she had been feeling better, it would be fine.

The night of the dinner, I went all out, making a fancy three-course meal with decadent desserts. I was really proud of what I had created. When my girlfriend arrived, I could tell she was a little overwhelmed by the spread. I didn’t think much of it at the time, since she'd already eaten a small meal before coming over.

During the dinner, I noticed that she barely touched her food. I asked her if she was okay, and she forced a smile, saying she was just really full. But as the night went on, she started to become visibly anxious, and eventually, she excused herself to the bathroom. I found out later that she was struggling with anxiety about the food and felt ashamed for not being able to participate like everyone else.

When she came back, I tried to lighten the mood by joking about how she was missing out on my culinary masterpiece. I thought it would help her relax. Instead, she looked hurt and said I should have considered her feelings before making such rich food. I brushed it off, saying it was just a dinner party and that she needed to loosen up.

Afterward, she texted me that I was inconsiderate and didn’t respect her boundaries regarding food. I didn’t think it was a big deal, but now I’m starting to wonder if I was the one being the jerk. Was I too wrapped up in my cooking to think about her? Am I the asshole here?",510,1119,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_81642,2018-05-17 00:00:00,YTA,2122,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I needed to make a throwaway account for this because my friends know my main one and I’m not ready to face the backlash.

So, here’s the deal. I (28F) have a best friend, Sarah (27F), who is a single mom to a really sweet 5-year-old boy, Jake. I love spending time with them, and I often babysit Jake while Sarah works. I’ve always been the “fun aunt” type, and I enjoy making him happy.

Last week, I invited them over for a movie night. I made a bunch of popcorn and set up a cozy area in my living room. I had planned to watch a kid-friendly movie that Jake would love. But just before the movie started, I jokingly said to Sarah, “You know, if Jake wants any popcorn, he better be prepared to do a little dance for it.” I thought it would be a funny way to get him excited.

Jake took it seriously and started dancing, which was adorable. But after a couple of minutes, I started to get a bit bored. I decided to change things up and said, “Okay, now let’s make it a competition! Whoever dances the best gets a whole bowl of popcorn to themselves!” I figured it would be fun, but I didn’t account for Sarah’s reaction. She got really upset and told me that it wasn’t okay to make Jake feel like he had to compete for snacks or that he was being judged.

I brushed it off, thinking she was overreacting. After all, I was just trying to have fun, and Jake seemed to enjoy it. So I encouraged him more, telling him to ""show off those dance moves!"" He was giggling, but Sarah looked furious. She ended up taking him home early, and I didn’t understand why she was so mad.

Later, I called her to apologize for the misunderstanding, but she still insisted that I was being insensitive. I told her she was being too serious and that it was just harmless fun. I mean, it’s just dancing, right? She said I should have been more considerate of how kids can feel pressured in competitions, even if they’re just for popcorn, and that I needed to respect her parenting style more.

Now I’m really confused. I didn’t think I did anything wrong, and I feel like she’s overreacting. Am I the asshole for wanting to have some fun and trying to engage Jake in a silly competition?",127,889,0.69,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_72865,2020-10-17 00:00:00,YTA,2168,AITA

Last week, I decided to throw a small celebration for her graduation. I invited our close family and a few of her friends. Emily was really happy and grateful when I told her about it, but she mentioned wanting to have a low-key weekend instead because she was feeling overwhelmed. I brushed it off, thinking she’d appreciate the gesture once it was done.

On the day of the celebration, I went all out—decorations, food, and even a slideshow of her life moments. I thought it was perfect! But when she arrived, Emily seemed a bit taken aback and overwhelmed. She smiled and thanked me, but I could tell she wasn’t really feeling it. I kept insisting that she should be excited and enjoy it, but she looked anxious and said she just wanted to relax.

During the celebration, I kept pushing her to open gifts and mingle with everyone, even when she said she needed a break. I thought I was helping her celebrate, but I realize now that I was putting a lot of pressure on her. At one point, she snapped at me, saying, ""I just wanted a quiet weekend, not a big party!"" I felt hurt, but I insisted that everyone was having a good time and that she should too.

Afterward, she told me that I didn’t respect her wishes and that I ended up making her feel worse instead of celebrating.

You're the Asshole,"Last weekend was my niece’s wedding, and I was really excited to be there. My sister and her fiancé planned a beautiful event, and I was honored to be part of it. However, I made a huge mistake regarding my outfit choice. I decided to wear a bright neon green suit that I thought would stand out and be fun. I’ve always liked bold fashion, and given that I’m known for my quirky style, I thought it would be a hit.

When I arrived at the venue, I immediately noticed that everyone else was dressed elegantly, with classic colors like navy, black, and soft pastels. My suit was so loud that it drew attention away from the bride and groom, and I started to feel embarrassed. However, I convinced myself that I was just being my usual self and having fun with it.

During the ceremony, I realized that people were trying to take pictures, and my outfit was completely overshadowing the couple. I overheard some guests whispering about how distracting my outfit was. Instead of taking a hint, I thought it would be funny to lean into it. I started posing dramatically in the background of their photos, striking exaggerated poses, thinking that I was adding to the fun of the occasion.

Later, at the reception, my sister pulled me aside and calmly told me that while she appreciated my individuality, I was making it difficult for people to focus on the wedding itself. I got defensive and told her she was being too uptight and needed to lighten up. I even said that if they didn’t want such a vibrant personality around, maybe they shouldn’t have invited me.

After that, I noticed the mood shift. Guests were whispering and giving me sideways glances. I continued to dance and make jokes, hoping to shift the atmosphere back to fun, but it didn’t work. By the end of the night, my sister was visibly upset, and when I left, I overheard her telling someone that she wished I had respected her special day more.

Now, I feel like I might have gone too far. I thought I was being fun and quirky, but maybe I was just being inconsiderate.

You're the Asshole,"My sister and I have always had a competitive relationship. Growing up, we were always compared to each other—who got better grades, who was more athletic, who had more friends. It’s just how our family dynamics worked. Now that we're adults, it seems like that competition has only intensified.

Recently, my sister started training for a half-marathon. I’ve never been much of a runner, but I decided to sign up for the same race just to support her. When she found out I was joining, she said that she was going to beat me no matter what. I shrugged it off, thinking it would be friendly competition.

As we trained, I noticed she really wanted to talk about her progress and get my input. I wasn’t very invested in the training itself, so I didn't pay much attention to her running tips. I ended up not training as hard as I should have, often skipping runs when I felt tired or instead going out with friends. I figured I’d just show up and do my best on race day.

On race day, my sister was pumped and had been preparing for months. I, on the other hand, didn’t take it as seriously as I should have, and I ended up running a lot slower than I expected. When she crossed the finish line and saw me lagging behind, she started to laugh and yell, ""I told you I would beat you!"" 

I got frustrated and snapped back at her that it wasn’t a big deal and that she was taking it too seriously. Then I told her it was annoying how she always had to turn everything into a competition. After that, she got upset and said I was being a poor sport and that I should have taken it more seriously if I didn't want to be humiliated.

You're the Asshole,"I (30F) recently threw a surprise birthday party for my best friend (30F), who I'll call Sarah. I knew she had been feeling down because she had just gone through a tough breakup, so I wanted to cheer her up. I coordinated with some of our mutual friends, rented a venue, and arranged for food and drinks. It was all meant to be a fun and uplifting experience.

The problem started when I decided to invite a few people from Sarah's past who I knew she didn't get along with, including her ex-boyfriend and a couple of old friends she had a falling out with. In my mind, I thought it would be a great chance for them to have a chance to make amends and for Sarah to see how much her friend group cared about her. My intention was good, but I didn't consider how this might affect her.

On the day of the party, when Sarah arrived and saw her ex there, she immediately became upset. She felt ambushed and overwhelmed, especially since she wasn't expecting to see him and had no desire to interact with him. I tried to diffuse the situation, but Sarah ended up leaving the party early, feeling hurt and disappointed.

Afterwards, she confronted me about it. She said I should have respected her boundaries and that inviting people she had negative feelings towards was inconsiderate. I was taken aback because I thought I was doing something nice for her, and I felt confused. I ended up defending my actions, saying I just wanted to bring everyone together to support her.

Now, a few of our friends are divided on the situation. Some agree with me that I was trying to help, while others think I was out of line for not considering Sarah's feelings. I feel bad that she ended up upset, but I still think my intentions were good.

You're the Asshole,"My sister [29] has always been a strong, independent person. She recently went through a tough breakup, and I could see she was struggling. We’re pretty close, so I wanted to help her through it. I suggested that we spend more time together and even offered to take her out for dinner a few times to cheer her up.

However, I noticed that she was spending a lot of time on social media, posting about her breakup and how ""free"" she felt now. While I understood she needed to express herself, I felt that she was oversharing and making her ex look bad. I decided to confront her about it, thinking I was helping her realize it might not be the best idea to air out her dirty laundry online.

When I brought it up, she got defensive and said she was just processing her feelings in her own way. I insisted that she was being immature and that her posts were hurting not just her ex but also her reputation. I told her that if she kept it up, people would think badly of her, and I was worried about how it would affect her future dating life.

I thought I was being a good sister by giving her this tough love, but she ended up really upset. She said I was being unsupportive and judgmental when all she needed was a shoulder to cry on. I didn’t understand why she was so upset—after all, I was only trying to help her see the bigger picture.

Now, I’m starting to think that maybe I overstepped. I genuinely thought I was doing what was best for her, but it seems like I just made things worse. Am I the asshole for criticizing her coping mechanism?",962,2464,0.59,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_17273,2018-03-30 00:00:00,YTA,1548,AITA
You're the Asshole,"My brother (let's call him Jake) and I are both in our late 20s. Recently, Jake got engaged to his longtime girlfriend, Sarah, and they decided to have a small, intimate wedding ceremony at a beautiful venue. They asked me to be the best man, which I was honored to accept.

The issue arose when they sent out the invitations. Jake called me to discuss the guest list, and I suggested that since it was a small wedding, they should consider inviting our parents' friends who had been close to our family for years. I thought it would be nice to include them since many of them had attended our family gatherings and had known us since we were kids.

Jake and Sarah disagreed with my suggestion, saying they wanted to keep it purely a gathering of close friends and family. I didn’t take it well; I felt they were being inconsiderate and not valuing the relationships that had been important to us growing up. I pushed back hard, insisting that they should include at least a couple of those family friends. 

Eventually, in a moment of frustration, I told Jake that he was being selfish for not wanting to include people who cared about us. I also accused him of trying to make the wedding all about him and Sarah, rather than celebrating with everyone who has been a part of our lives. I might have raised my voice a bit too, which I now realize wasn’t appropriate.

Jake got upset and said I was being controlling and that it was their day, so they should be able to decide who they want to invite. I told him it was disappointing that he didn't understand the importance of family and the connections we've built over the years. After that, he hung up on me, and I later found out that he and Sarah were feeling really hurt and stressed about the whole situation.

Now, I feel like I might have ruined their excitement for the wedding, and my insistence on the guest list has put a strain on our relationship. My other family members think I overstepped and should have respected their wishes. 

TLDR; I pushed my brother and his fiancée to invite family friends to their small wedding, thinking it was important, but I ended up raising my voice and hurting their feelings. AITA?",770,609,0.52,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_45279,2022-12-15 00:00:00,YTA,2182,AITA

During the party, Lisa brought up an embarrassing story about Jake from a previous relationship, and he was clearly uncomfortable. Instead of letting it go, I decided to tease him a bit more because I thought it was all in good fun and everyone was laughing. I made a few jokes at his expense, and while some people laughed, I could see that Jake was getting visibly upset.

Eventually, he just stood up and left the room. I didn't think much of it at the time, assuming he was just being overly sensitive. A little while later, Lisa told me that Jake felt humiliated and that I had gone too far. She said he was really hurt by my jokes and wanted to leave the party.

I apologized to her, but I didn't think I needed to apologize to him because I felt it was all in good fun. I tried to defend myself by saying that everyone was laughing, and Jake should have just taken it as a joke. Lisa was upset with me for not reaching out to Jake directly.

You're the Asshole,"When I was in high school, I had a very different approach to academics than most. I was the type of student who believed that rules were meant to be broken. I would skip classes regularly, go out partying instead of studying, and I barely scraped by with my grades. My parents didn’t really care; they were more focused on their own lives and left me to figure things out. Because of this, I didn't learn the value of hard work or responsibility until much later in life.

Fast forward to now, and I’m a parent to a 12-year-old daughter. My wife and I have made it a priority to emphasize the importance of education to her, and we often remind her of how crucial it is to do well in school. Recently, she received a few C grades in her subjects, which I didn’t take lightly. I decided to ground her for a month and took away her phone and computer privileges. I told her that she needs to work harder and that anything less than an A or B is unacceptable.

After I imposed these restrictions, my daughter seemed really upset and came to me, tears in her eyes, and said, “Dad, you were never a good student. You didn’t care about school at all. Why should I be punished for not being perfect?” At that moment, I felt a twinge of guilt, but I brushed it off. I told her that I expect better from her because she’s capable of so much more than I ever was. 

I know it sounds hypocritical, but I truly believe that my tough love will prepare her for life. She’s young, and I think she needs to learn that life isn’t easy and that she needs to push herself. My wife, however, thinks I might be being too harsh and that I’m projecting my failures onto her.

I even set up a separate account that I use to follow him, so I can see everything without him knowing it's me. I’ve even liked a few of his posts, pretending to be a random follower. 

When I finally told him what I had done, he was furious. He accused me of violating his trust and invading his privacy. I mean, I get it, but I think I’m just being a responsible parent. I’m just trying to keep him safe from potential online harm.

Recently, our parents threw a small family dinner to celebrate Jake's birthday. During dinner, I brought up the topic of his job search, thinking it would be a good opportunity to motivate him. I asked him what companies he was applying to, and when he mentioned he hadn’t applied to any because he was waiting for the “perfect job,” I lost my patience. I told him that he needed to stop being lazy and just apply to anything, even if it wasn’t ideal. I said he was embarrassing himself and wasting our parents' support.

Jake is super passionate about his music, and while I think that’s great, he constantly talks about it every time we meet.

Instead of empathizing, Jake immediately launched into a story about how he stayed up all night working on his new song and how it’s going to change his life. I was just trying to share my feelings, and it felt like he completely dismissed my struggles.

My girlfriend was understandably upset by my suggestion. She wants to keep the baby and feels that we can make it work together. I know she’s excited and has always wanted to be a mother, so I felt guilty bringing up my concerns. But I also feel like I shouldn’t be forced into a situation I’m not prepared for. 

In the heat of the argument, I ended up saying some hurtful things to her, like how she’s being selfish for wanting to keep the baby when I’m not ready. I could see the hurt in her eyes, and I immediately felt bad, but part of me still thinks I have a right to my feelings. 

Now, she’s distancing herself from me, and I’m worried that I’ve ruined our relationship. I feel torn because I think I was just being honest about my fears, but I also see how much this meant to her.

You're the Asshole,"So, I (38M) have a younger sister, Emma (25F), who recently got engaged. She's been with her fiancé for about a year, and they seem to be really happy together. However, Emma has always struggled with her weight, and I’ve been very vocal about my opinions on health and fitness over the years. 

I’ve always believed that it's important to take care of your body, and I've been a bit of a fitness fanatic myself. I work out regularly, eat healthy, and I just think that taking care of yourself is a reflection of self-respect. I’ve tried to motivate Emma to join me in living a healthier lifestyle, but she’s never really taken to it. 

When she got engaged, I decided to express my concerns about her health to her. I said something like, “You know, marriage can be a lot easier if you feel good about yourself, and I worry about you being healthy.” I thought I was being helpful, but she took it really personally. She said that I was body-shaming her and that it was completely inappropriate for me to comment on her weight, especially as she was about to start planning her wedding.

I brushed it off, thinking she was just being overly sensitive. My wife (36F) tried to back her up, saying that I was being rude, but I didn't really agree. I felt like I was just trying to help her and that I had good intentions. When Emma told me I was being hurtful, I responded by saying, “If you want to be happy in your marriage, you need to take better care of yourself. It's tough love.” 

After that, our family got together for dinner, and there was a lot of awkwardness. Emma didn’t want to talk to me, and when I tried to engage her, she just shut me down. I probably should have let it go, but I ended up saying, “If you can’t handle a little advice from your brother, maybe you shouldn’t have gotten engaged in the first place.” 

Now everyone is upset with me, and I honestly don’t see what I did wrong. I was just trying to look out for her. AITA?",473,518,0.61,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_17524,2023-07-26 00:00:00,YTA,1951,AITA

Recently, she came to me and expressed that she wanted to take a few art classes to improve her portfolio and increase her chances of getting hired. It’s something she’s really excited about, and she believes it could help her career. However, the classes aren’t cheap, and she asked if I could help her with the tuition.

I immediately shot her down and told her that I don’t think it’s a good idea. I pointed out that she should focus on finding a job first, rather than spending more money on classes that may not even guarantee her a job. I told her that it feels like she’s just stalling instead of taking proactive steps towards her career. I also mentioned that I’m already paying off my own student loans and can’t afford to help her financially.

I could see she was really upset by my response, and she accused me of not believing in her dreams. I told her that while I understand her passion, I just want her to be realistic about her situation. I suggested that she just keep applying for jobs instead of investing in classes that might not lead anywhere.

He had been talking about wanting to take his mind off things, so I thought it would be a great idea to go on a weekend getaway together. I planned everything, from the hotel to the activities, and was really excited to spend some quality time with him.

During the trip, I wanted to make it memorable, so I decided to throw a small party in our hotel room with a few other friends who lived nearby. I invited them without checking with Jake first, thinking he would enjoy the surprise. However, when I told him about the party, he seemed really uncomfortable and said he wasn’t in the mood for socializing.

I brushed it off, thinking he was just having a rough day, and I went ahead with the party anyway. I figured it would lift his spirits. When the friends arrived, I was having a great time, but Jake just sat in the corner, clearly upset. I tried to include him, but he kept saying he wanted some time alone. I thought he was just being antisocial, so I continued to have fun.

Eventually, Jake left the room and went for a walk. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but later he texted me saying he felt betrayed and that I didn’t respect his feelings. I was taken aback and told him he was being dramatic, that it was just a small gathering, and that he needed to lighten up. I ended up going to bed without resolving anything.

You're the Asshole,"Last weekend, I was at a friend's birthday party. It was a pretty big gathering with lots of people. I had brought a gift for my friend, but it was a bit on the expensive side. I was feeling pretty good and wanted to make sure everyone knew how generous I was being, so I made a big show of presenting the gift in front of everyone.

Later in the evening, I noticed another friend, Sarah, sitting alone in a corner. She looked a bit upset, so I decided to approach her. Instead of asking if she was okay, I launched into a story about how I had spent so much on my friend's gift and how I was the best gift-giver ever. I was talking about how I always go above and beyond for my friends and how I can't stand when people don't appreciate nice things.

As I was going on about my generosity, Sarah's expression changed from sad to hurt. I didn't notice at first, but later I found out that she had recently gone through a tough time financially and was feeling embarrassed about not being able to afford nice gifts for her friends. 

After I finished my rant, Sarah left the party early, and I overheard another friend saying that she was upset by what I said. I felt a bit bad but justified it by thinking that I was just sharing my excitement about the gift.

Now I'm wondering if I was an asshole for not being more sensitive to Sarah's feelings and for making the party about my gift rather than focusing on my friend's birthday.

He’s been playing guitar since he was a kid and has been writing his own songs for a few years now. He dreams of making it big in the music industry, and he spends most of his time practicing, recording, or gigging at local bars. 

I admire his dedication, but I’ve always been more practical. I have a stable job and I’m working towards my master’s degree. I worry about him because the music industry is tough, and I fear he might end up struggling financially if he doesn’t have a backup plan.

Recently, Jake got an opportunity to showcase his music at a local festival, which could really help him gain some exposure. He was super excited about it and asked if I could come and support him. I agreed but told him that he should consider getting a part-time job to supplement his income while he pursues music. 

A few days before the festival, I brought it up again, telling him that he should really think about a more stable career path just in case things don’t work out with music. I pushed him to apply for some part-time jobs and to have a plan B. He seemed really upset and told me that I was being unsupportive and that I was ruining his excitement for the festival.

I thought I was just being realistic and looking out for him, but now I feel bad because I didn’t mean to crush his dreams or make him feel unsupported.

We often go out to eat together, but lately, I’ve noticed she’s been trying to save money and eat healthier, so she’s been bringing her own meals when we go out. I guess I didn’t really take her new habits seriously, because last week, we went to our favorite restaurant, and I ordered my usual burger and fries. 

As we were sitting down, I noticed Sarah had brought her own homemade salad and some grilled chicken. I thought it was a bit odd to bring your own food to a restaurant, but I didn’t say anything. When the waiter came over, I jokingly said, ""Don't you want to indulge a little? You brought your own food to a restaurant!"" Sarah didn’t laugh. She just looked a bit uncomfortable and said she was trying to stick to her diet. 

I kept teasing her about it throughout the meal, saying things like, ""You’re missing out on the best burger in town!"" and ""Come on, live a little!"" It was all in good fun, or at least I thought it was. I didn’t realize how much it bothered her until she suddenly got up and left the table, saying she needed a moment.

When she came back, she looked upset, and I apologized for making her feel bad, but I insisted I was just joking. She told me I was being inconsiderate and rude, and that it wasn’t cool to make fun of her choices, especially in public. I got defensive and told her she was overreacting—that it was just a joke and I didn't mean any harm.

So, my sister asked me to be a bridesmaid, and of course, I said yes. A few weeks later, she mentioned that they were planning a small wedding and that she wanted to keep it intimate, only inviting close family and friends. I completely understood and respected her wishes.

I decided to voice my opinion to my sister and told her that I think she should reconsider her decision and invite our cousin. I even went so far as to say that if she didn't invite her, I would be uncomfortable participating in the wedding.

My sister was really upset by my ultimatum and said it was her day and her decision to make. I felt like I was just looking out for our cousin and trying to keep the peace in the family.

She'll often call me to discuss details and expects me to agree with her choices without question.

One day, she called me to talk about the wedding colors. She was set on a particular shade of pink, which I thought clashed with the venue. I casually mentioned that maybe we could consider a different color that might complement the space better. She got super defensive and said I was being unsupportive.

After that, I felt kind of resentful. I started to think about how much time I've spent listening to her and helping out, so I decided to take a step back. I stopped answering her calls and avoided her whenever I could. I figured if she really wanted my help, she'd reach out more enthusiastically.

Fast forward to a few weeks later, and she texted me saying she was feeling stressed about the wedding and needed my support. I responded by saying that I’ve been busy and maybe she should just handle things on her own since she obviously didn’t want my input anyway. I thought it was fair to give her a taste of what it was like to plan everything without me.

So, I (32F) have a younger sister, Emily (25F), who just had her first baby a few weeks ago. She and her husband are thrilled, but they've been struggling with the sleepless nights and the stress that comes with being new parents. I understand how overwhelming it can be, and I want to support her.

I’ve always had a strained relationship with my sister. Growing up, she was the favorite child, and it often felt like everything she did was celebrated while I was overlooked. I’ve tried to let it go, but I still have some lingering resentment. 

Anyway, I decided to show my support by offering to babysit for a few hours so she and her husband could get some much-needed rest. Emily was hesitant at first, but she agreed, feeling grateful for the help.

The day came for me to watch the baby, and I was pretty excited. However, as soon as I arrived, I found myself feeling annoyed with how Emily and her husband were handling the baby. They were both so anxious, and I couldn’t help but roll my eyes at their constant hovering and second-guessing everything I did.

After a couple of hours of trying to calm the baby, I snapped. I told them that they needed to chill out and that they were making it harder on themselves with all their worry. I mean, I'm not a professional, but I know how to hold a baby and change a diaper! I even said something sarcastic like, ""This isn't rocket science, just relax.""

Emily got really upset and started crying, saying she just wanted to do her best as a new mom. I felt a little guilty initially but quickly brushed it off. I thought she was overreacting since it was just some honest feedback. I ended up leaving early, saying I couldn't deal with the stress of her emotions on top of the baby crying.

I told him that I couldn’t justify spending that much money on shoes, especially since he’s still growing and might outgrow them soon. I offered to buy him a more affordable pair, but he insisted that it had to be those specific shoes.

I didn’t think it was fair for me to spend that much on something that’s not a necessity, especially when he already has decent shoes. I also pointed out that he could save up his allowance or get a part-time job to buy them himself if he wanted them so badly. This led to a huge argument where he called me unsupportive and said I didn’t care about his dreams.

After that, I decided to take away his basketball privileges. I told him he wouldn’t be allowed to practice with his team or play in any games until he could show me some responsibility, like saving up for the shoes. I thought I was teaching him a valuable lesson about money and prioritizing his expenses.

Now, he’s really upset with me, and his teammates are noticing that he’s not around. His coach even reached out to me, expressing concern that this could affect Jason’s chances of playing in college. But I still feel like I did the right thing. I just don’t see why I should spend a ton of money on shoes when he could learn to earn it himself. 

I know he’s passionate about basketball, but I think it’s important for him to understand the value of money. My wife thinks I’m being too harsh, but I just don’t want to be one of those parents who spoils their kids.

You're the Asshole,"I have a friend, Sarah, who has been struggling with her mental health for a while now. She has a history of anxiety and depression, and recently, she admitted to me that she had been feeling particularly overwhelmed. I wanted to be supportive, but I also have my own life to manage, and I can only handle so much.

A few weeks ago, Sarah reached out to me and asked if I could come over to help her with some things around her apartment. She mentioned that she was really feeling low and could use a friend to talk to. I agreed, but when I got there, I was shocked by the state of her place. It was a complete mess—clothes everywhere, dishes piled up, and a strong smell that I later learned was from spoiled food.

As I was helping her clean up, I noticed she was just sitting on the couch scrolling through her phone and not really engaging in any of the cleaning. I felt frustrated because I had taken time out of my day to help her, and it seemed like she was just using me as a free maid. After a while, I snapped and told her that if she really wanted to feel better, she needed to put in some effort herself instead of just relying on me to fix everything for her.

Sarah got upset and accused me of being harsh and unsupportive. I told her that I was just being realistic and that she needed to take some responsibility for her own life. She started crying and said she felt like I didn’t care about her struggles. After that, I left her apartment feeling guilty, but also a bit justified because I felt I had given her tough love.

You're the Asshole,"So last weekend, I went to a barbecue at my neighbor's house. I brought some beer and a couple of sides, and we were all having a great time. I got a bit too tipsy, but I thought I was still fine. As the evening went on, I started making some rather inappropriate jokes and comments, thinking everyone was laughing with me. 

At one point, I made a joke about one of the guests' outfits, calling it “ridiculous” and saying they should “get a fashion sense.” I thought it was humorous, but the guest looked really hurt and left shortly after. I didn’t think much of it at the time because I felt like everyone else was still having a good time and laughing. 

Later, a couple of my friends pulled me aside and told me that I had crossed a line with my comments and that I should apologize. I brushed them off, insisting that people needed to lighten up and that it was just a joke. I didn’t see what the big deal was. 

The next day, I received a message from the guest I insulted, saying that my comments were hurtful and that they wouldn’t be attending any more barbecues if I was going to be there. I felt a bit bad but also thought they were being overly sensitive. 

When I told my friends about the message, they said I needed to apologize, but I refused to. I felt like I shouldn’t have to apologize for joking around, especially since I was drunk. I told them that if I had offended someone, they needed to get over it.

Instead of handling it calmly, I snapped at him, telling him he needed to be more careful and that he ruined my tablecloth.

My sister was clearly annoyed with me for yelling at her son, and I could see the kids were visibly upset. I ended up saying that he should just learn to pay attention and not make such a mess, which only made things worse.

When I walked in, I noticed that all the good snacks were gone. There were only a few bags of chips left and some leftover veggies.

Instead of just accepting it, I decided to make a scene about how unfair it was that I missed the food. I loudly complained, saying things like, “It’s ridiculous that you guys didn’t save me any pizza!” 

My friends tried to reassure me that there would be more snacks later, but I kept going on about how they should've waited for me to eat.

We’ve been friends for years, and I thought it would be nice to catch up, especially since we hadn't seen each other in a while. I decided to cook a special meal for her because I wanted to show how much I appreciate her friendship.

A couple of days before her visit, I remembered that Sarah has been trying to eat healthier lately and has mentioned she’s been on a diet. I thought it would be funny to surprise her with a 'healthy' spaghetti dish made with zucchini noodles instead of regular pasta. I found a recipe online that looked good, and I was excited to show her my culinary skills.

When Sarah arrived, I served the meal with a big smile, but the look on her face quickly changed from excitement to confusion. She tried the dish, and her expression soured even more. She politely told me that she wasn't really into the whole zucchini noodle thing and preferred traditional pasta. I laughed it off, thinking she was joking at first, but she repeated that she wasn't enjoying it. 

Feeling a bit offended, I told her she was missing out and insisted she eat more. This turned into a bit of a back-and-forth, where I pushed her to finish her plate. I thought I was being a good friend by encouraging her to try something new and healthy, but she just kept getting more and more uncomfortable. Eventually, she put her fork down, clearly frustrated, and told me she wanted to just order some regular pasta instead.

I shrugged it off and said, “C’mon, don’t be so dramatic! It’s just a meal.” We ended up having an awkward silence until I finally suggested we just order something. She left shortly after, saying she needed to go home and wasn’t feeling great.

I (28F) have a close friend, Sarah (29F), who I’ve known for years. We’ve always been there for each other through thick and thin. However, about a year ago, we had a falling out with another mutual friend, Mike (30M). The situation was pretty messy and involved a big misunderstanding where I felt Mike had betrayed my trust by spreading rumors about me. I confronted him about it, and instead of apologizing, he got defensive and tried to turn it around on me. Sarah was caught in the middle and ended up taking Mike’s side, which hurt me deeply.

After that, I decided to cut ties with Mike completely. I told Sarah that I didn’t want to be around him anymore and asked her to keep her distance from him as well. I felt that if she truly valued our friendship, she would understand and respect my wishes. Sarah, however, didn’t think it was fair to put that kind of restriction on her friendships, and she continued to hang out with Mike. This made me feel betrayed all over again.

Recently, Sarah invited me to a party that Mike would also be attending. I told her I wouldn’t go if he was there and asked her again to reconsider her friendship with him. She said she didn’t want to choose sides and that I needed to let it go. I got really upset, feeling like she wasn’t being a true friend by not supporting me.

In a moment of frustration, I sent her a message saying that if she continued to be friends with Mike, then maybe we should take a break from our friendship, too.

I thought everything would go smoothly, but I didn't expect the tension that would arise.

Before the party, my dad mentioned that his girlfriend, Lisa (26 F), would be joining us. I didn't have any issues with that initially, but as the day approached, I started feeling uneasy.

I work at a small tech startup and we have this tradition where everyone celebrates their work anniversaries with a small team gathering. It’s a nice way to acknowledge each other’s contributions and boost morale. Recently, I hit my three-year mark and was excited for the little celebration.

However, I’ve noticed that one of my coworkers, let’s call her Sarah, has a habit of turning everything into a competition. Last month, she was upset because her two-year celebration didn’t involve as much fanfare as someone else’s. I get it; everyone wants to feel appreciated. But to be honest, I think she overreacts quite a bit.

When it was my turn for the celebration, I planned a small gathering in the office with snacks and a cake. I sent out an invite to everyone, but I intentionally didn’t include Sarah because I wanted to keep it low-key and I honestly just wanted to avoid her competitive energy. I felt that if she came, she might make it all about herself again, and I really wanted to just celebrate with the people who genuinely support each other.

Well, my celebration day came, and guess what? Sarah showed up anyway. She barged in, clearly upset that she wasn’t invited. Instead of just letting it go, she started making snarky comments about how she thought all anniversaries were supposed to be celebrated equally, and that it wasn’t fair for me to exclude her. Honestly, it turned awkward and I felt really uncomfortable.

After the gathering, I talked to my manager about it, and he told me I was being inconsiderate and should have included Sarah. He said it’s important to foster a positive environment, and by excluding her, I was undermining that.

Recently, Jess got engaged, and I was thrilled for her. She asked me to be her maid of honor, and I was honored. However, I took it a step further by telling her that I would be making all the decisions for the wedding planning. I figured since I know her so well, I could make it easier for her.

One day, I decided to host a small birthday party for my son and invited Lisa and Ethan. I made a cake, decorated with colorful frosting and filled with candy, which is the kind of cake kids love. I knew Ethan would want to enjoy it too, so instead of just letting him have a slice, I secretly gave him a giant piece of cake when Lisa wasn't looking. I thought it would be a fun treat for him, and I wanted to see him happy.

When Lisa found out, she was furious. She told me that I had disrespected her parenting choices and that I had no right to undermine her rules. I tried to explain that I just wanted Ethan to have a little fun, but she didn’t see it that way. After that, our friendship has gotten really tense, and I feel like I did the right thing by letting Ethan enjoy the cake.

We hit it off, and after a few drinks, we ended up going back to her place. Everything was fine at first; we were having fun, laughing, and talking. But then things took a turn when we started getting intimate.

Honestly, I was a bit drunk, and I didn't really pay attention to her boundaries. I pushed for things that she seemed hesitant about, but I just brushed it off because I thought we were both into it. Afterward, she mentioned feeling uncomfortable with some of the things that happened. I brushed it aside and told her she was overreacting. 

The next day, I texted her, but she seemed distant and upset. I didn't understand why she was acting that way, so I called her out on it, saying she was being dramatic. I told her I had a good time, and she should lighten up. She ended up telling me that she felt like I didn’t respect her limits, and that really hit me. 

Instead of apologizing or trying to understand her perspective, I got defensive and accused her of ruining what could have been a fun connection. I even went as far as to say that I didn’t see what the big deal was. 

I really didn’t think I did anything wrong, but my friends suggested I might have been an asshole for not respecting her feelings. I still feel like I was just having fun, but maybe I should have been more mindful. AITA for not taking her feelings seriously?

1. I don’t like being the center of attention. 
2. I have a lot of work to do, and I didn’t want to take time off from my tasks.
3. I think surprise parties are awkward and forced.

When the day came, I walked into the break room, and there they were with balloons and cake. Instead of being gracious, I rolled my eyes and said, ""Really? This is unnecessary. Can we just skip this?"" I could tell everyone was taken aback and disappointed, but I didn’t care. I felt like I had a right to voice my opinion since it was my birthday.

Afterward, a few coworkers mentioned that my reaction was rude and that they were just trying to do something nice for me. I brushed it off and insisted that I was just being honest about how I felt.

My cousin has a sweet dog named Max, who is friendly and always looking for attention. While everyone was busy enjoying the food, I noticed Max was wandering around looking a bit sad.

I decided it would be funny to tease him, so I grabbed a piece of meat from my plate and started waving it in front of him just out of reach. Max was jumping and barking, trying to get the food. My family saw what I was doing, and instead of stopping me, they laughed and encouraged me to keep it up. I thought I was putting on a show.

Eventually, I threw the piece of meat for him to catch, but he didn't get it. Instead, he ran straight into a table and knocked over some drinks. My cousin was furious and shouted at me for being irresponsible and reckless. I just shrugged it off, saying it was just a dog and that everyone was overreacting. I continued laughing while others looked uncomfortable.

Now, my cousin isn’t talking to me, and the rest of the family is split on whether I was in the wrong or not.

Recently, I was at a small gathering at my friend Jake's house, and we were all just hanging out and having a good time. Jake's sister, Sarah (22F), was also there, and she has been struggling with her mental health for a while now. She’s been open about it, and we all try to be supportive.

At one point, I made a joke about how I sometimes wish I could just turn off my feelings, you know, like a light switch. It was meant to be funny, a light-hearted comment about how overwhelming emotions can be. But apparently, it struck a nerve with Sarah because she suddenly got quiet and just looked at me.

I noticed her reaction and just brushed it off, thinking she was being overly sensitive. A few minutes later, I made another joke about how everyone was being so serious, and I said something like, ""Come on, it’s not like we’re all in therapy or something!"" I laughed, but Sarah didn’t join in. In fact, she got up and left the room, clearly upset.

Jake followed her out, and I overheard him telling her that I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings and that I was just joking. I felt a bit defensive because I thought it was harmless fun, and I was frustrated that she couldn't take a joke. When Jake came back in, I asked him why Sarah was so sensitive and why he was defending her. I said something like, “It’s just jokes, man. She needs to lighten up.”

Later that night, I found out that Sarah had been having a really rough week and that my comments had hit a little too close to home. I realized that maybe I should have been more mindful of her feelings, especially given her situation. But at the same time, I felt like I didn’t do anything wrong because I was just trying to have fun.

You're the Asshole,"I’ve always had a complicated relationship with my older sister, Emma. She was the golden child in our family—smart, talented, and always got the best grades. I often felt overshadowed by her accomplishments. As we grew up, our paths diverged; I went into a career that didn't require a degree, while she pursued an advanced degree and a high-paying job.

A few months ago, Emma got engaged, and I was genuinely happy for her. However, when she started planning her wedding, I felt a familiar pang of jealousy. She wanted a small wedding with just close family and friends, but I wasn't invited to the planning discussions. When I finally found out the date of the wedding, it was the same day as a concert I had been looking forward to for months. I had bought the tickets long before she announced her wedding date.

When I talked to Emma about it, I tried to express my excitement for her but also mentioned that I wouldn’t be able to make it to the wedding because of the concert. She was upset and accused me of prioritizing a concert over her wedding—a once-in-a-lifetime event. I brushed it off and told her that it was my life too, and I have my own priorities.

The day of the wedding came, and I went to the concert, posting videos and enjoying myself on social media. I even posted a story with a caption about “living my best life.” I didn’t think much of it until I got a text from Emma saying how hurt she was that I chose to miss her wedding and that I was flaunting my fun on social media. I told her she was overreacting and that she couldn’t expect me to drop everything for her wedding.

Now, my family is divided. Some think I should have made an effort to be there for her, while others believe I should live my life as I see fit.

You're the Asshole,"I’m in a bit of a situation, and I’m not sure how to handle it, so I’m hoping for some advice.

I (24F) work in a predominantly male tech office. My team has been working on a major project for the past few months, and we’re all feeling the pressure as the deadline approaches. Last week, one of my male colleagues, Jake (30M), proposed a gathering after work to unwind and celebrate our hard work. I thought it was a great idea, so I suggested we go to a nearby bar.

When we got there, the atmosphere was fun, and everyone started to relax. As the drinks flowed, I noticed that Jake started to get quite flirty. At first, I laughed it off, but it quickly became uncomfortable. He started making comments about my appearance and how he’d always had a crush on me. I tried to steer the conversation back to work, but he kept insisting on talking about personal things. 

Feeling overwhelmed, I decided to take a break and went outside for some fresh air. When I returned, Jake was waiting for me and asked to talk. I bluntly told him that I wasn’t interested in dating anyone from work and that his comments made me uncomfortable. He seemed taken aback and said I was being too harsh, that I should lighten up and just enjoy the night.

In the heat of the moment, I snapped and told him that he needed to stop acting like a frat boy and grow up. I could see the other colleagues looking at us, and I felt embarrassed, but I thought I was standing my ground. The night ended awkwardly, and Jake hasn’t spoken to me since. 

Now I’m feeling guilty. I know that I could have handled it differently, maybe spoken to him privately later instead of calling him out in front of everyone. I didn’t want to create a scene, but I felt it was necessary to set a boundary. I also worry that I may have contributed to an uncomfortable work environment, and I’m not sure if I should reach out and apologize for how I reacted.

Recently, Sarah started dating a guy named Jake, who is really nice but has very different views on parenting and children than I do. He’s very free-spirited and thinks that kids should be exposed to everything, including things that I deem inappropriate for Lily's age.

One day, while I was out, Sarah invited Jake over to hang out with her and Lily. I didn’t know he would be there, and when I found out, I was a bit taken aback. I trust Sarah, but I don't know Jake well enough to be comfortable with him being around my daughter unsupervised.

When I came home, I noticed that Jake had shown Lily some videos that I think are too mature for her. I was frustrated and confronted Sarah about it. Instead of explaining my concerns, I ended up raising my voice and telling her she was being irresponsible. I felt like I was protecting my child, but I realize now that I might have overstepped.

Sarah was really hurt and said she felt like I was attacking her parenting choices and that I should have communicated my feelings more calmly. I feel guilty because I know she loves Lily and wants the best for her, but I just couldn’t believe she would allow that to happen.

When we got there, I realized that the menu was a bit pricier than I expected, with most rolls being around $15-$20 each. I didn’t think it would be a problem, but when the bill came, I noticed that one of my friends, let's call him Jake, wasn’t eating much. He was just nibbling on some edamame and a small salad.

I casually asked him why he wasn’t getting more food, and he explained that he’s trying to save money because he’s been a bit tight on cash lately. I felt a little bad, but I didn’t think it was my responsibility to pay for his meal. So, I jokingly said, “Come on, it’s sushi night! Live a little!” and encouraged him to order more. 

Jake ended up ordering a $20 roll, but when the bill came, he looked shocked. I didn’t think much of it at the time and just divided the bill equally among us, which meant he had to pay for his roll too. He wasn’t happy about it and made a few comments about how he didn’t want to spend that much.

Later, he pulled me aside and said I was inconsiderate for pushing him to spend money he didn’t have and that it was unfair for all of us to split the bill when he barely ate anything.

She ended up having to munch on some fruit and a few chips, which clearly wasn't enough for a proper meal.

Feeling bad about the situation, I decided to order a gluten-free pizza for Emily after everyone had already eaten. I figured it would be a nice gesture to make her feel included. When I called in the order, I mentioned that it would be for just her, and the restaurant quoted me a price. 

When the pizza arrived, I decided to charge Emily for it. I told her that since I was already hosting, I thought it would be fair for her to cover the cost of her pizza. I handed her the bill, and her face dropped. She looked embarrassed and uncomfortable, but she handed me the money anyway.

You're the Asshole,"So, my friend recently started taking an interest in photography and has been posting her work on social media. She’s really passionate about it, but her photos are mostly just blurry shots of random things she finds interesting, and they don't really showcase any skill or technique. 

I’ve been into photography for a while and have taken classes, so I offered to help her improve her skills and gave her some constructive criticism. Instead of being grateful, she got defensive and accused me of trying to tear her down. I told her that she shouldn’t be upset because it’s important to have honest feedback if she wants to get better. 

I suggested she maybe shouldn’t post her photos until she feels more confident, because the comments she gets aren't always positive and I thought it might hurt her feelings. She ended up crying and saying I was trying to make her feel bad about something she loves.

I feel like I was just trying to help her see the reality of her work and encourage her to improve before sharing it with the world, but now I’m feeling guilty about the whole thing. Am I the asshole for trying to give her advice?",549,2138,0.73,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_83590,2023-09-07 00:00:00,YTA,1138,AITA
You're the Asshole,"So, I (25F) have a younger sister (21F) who is getting married soon. She has been planning her wedding for over a year and is really excited about it. I’m happy for her and have been supportive throughout the whole process. However, recently things took a turn when she asked me to be her maid of honor. 

Initially, I felt honored, but then I realized I had a big problem: I’ve been trying to lose weight for my own health reasons, and I’m currently at a weight I’m not comfortable with. I’ve been working hard, and I’m hoping to drop a significant amount before the wedding. So, I told my sister that I didn’t want to be her maid of honor because I didn’t want to be in the spotlight and feel self-conscious about my body on her big day. 

She was really upset and thought I was being selfish. She said that she wanted her sister by her side, no matter what size I am. But I stood my ground and insisted that it would be better for everyone if I just attended as a guest instead. I suggested she choose someone else who could fully embrace the role without any hesitation.

After our conversation, she ended up asking a mutual friend to step in as maid of honor, and I felt like a jerk for making her feel bad about something that was supposed to be a happy occasion. My family is split on whether I was right or wrong. Some agree with me that I should focus on my health, while others think I should have just sucked it up for her sake.

I feel bad that she’s sad, but I just didn’t want to feel uncomfortable in front of all those people. So, AITA for refusing to be my sister’s maid of honor because of my weight insecurities?",290,759,0.64,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_28235,2020-02-11 00:00:00,YTA,1631,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I work in a small office, and we recently hired a new intern, Emily. She’s young, eager to learn, and has been doing a great job so far. However, she’s also a bit shy and not very confident, which I notice makes her hesitant to speak up in meetings or ask for help when she needs it.

I’ve been in my role for a while, and I’m quite comfortable with our office dynamic. So, I took it upon myself to “mentor” Emily, which I thought would be a good way to help her get acclimated. But instead of being encouraging, I found myself taking control of her tasks. I started doing things like giving her very strict instructions on how to complete her assignments, often rewriting her emails or correcting her in front of others. I believed I was helping by showing her the “right” way to do things, but looking back, I realize I may have come off as condescending.

One day, during a team meeting, I completely undermined her when she tried to present her ideas. I interrupted her multiple times, rephrased what she said, and even acted like I was the one who came up with the idea in the first place. I thought I was just being assertive and demonstrating leadership, but I later overheard some colleagues expressing concern that I was being overly harsh and dismissive towards her.

Emily eventually approached me and expressed that she felt discouraged and unappreciated, and it hit me hard. I brushed her off initially, thinking I was just pushing her to be better, but now I feel terrible about how I treated her. My coworkers also mentioned that my behavior was creating a toxic environment for the team.

I’m starting to realize that my desire to help her may have turned into something harmful instead. I’ve been reflecting on my actions and whether I should apologize to Emily or acknowledge the way I’ve acted. I can’t help but feel that, while my intentions might have been good, I ended up being the asshole in this situation.",6,1263,0.71,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_99786,2022-04-10 00:00:00,YTA,1931,AITA

He’s been dealing with depression, and I really want to support him. However, it seems like every time we hang out, he just wants to talk about his problems, which gets incredibly draining for me. I understand that he needs someone to talk to, but I feel like there’s no balance in our friendship anymore.

Last week, we were supposed to go out to see a movie, but James started going off about how he feels like a failure in life and how nothing ever goes right for him. I was trying to steer the conversation to something lighter, but he kept bringing it back to his issues. Finally, I snapped and told him that he needs to stop being so negative all the time and that maybe he just needs to get over himself and take some responsibility for his situation.

James looked really hurt, and after that, he didn’t want to go to the movie. He said he didn’t need more negativity in his life and left. I felt a bit bad, but I really thought he needed a wake-up call. I told a few mutual friends about it, and they said I was being rude and unsupportive. I think I was just being honest, though, and trying to encourage him to see things differently.

When it was my turn, I thought it would be funny to share a “story” about how my elopement was actually a secret mission to escape the pressures of planning a wedding. I made it sound more dramatic than it was, exaggerating how I was ""running away"" from the whole wedding industry and how much I hated the idea of a big wedding.

My brother laughed at first, but then his fiancée looked visibly upset. I didn't think much of it and continued joking about how they were making a huge mistake by having a big wedding and should just elope instead. My brother suddenly got serious and told me that my comments were hurtful, especially since they were really excited about their plans. I brushed it off, thinking he was overreacting.

After dinner, my brother and his fiancée confronted me about my insensitivity, and I ended up getting defensive. I told them it was just a joke and that they needed to lighten up.

My family is quite traditional, and they have specific expectations about relationships and future plans. They believe that a couple should get married before living together, and they've been quite vocal about it. I love my boyfriend, but I don't feel ready to take that step just yet, and I want to live with him first to see how we function together on a daily basis.

Recently, my family threw a big family dinner, and I invited my boyfriend to come along. I thought it would be a good opportunity for them to meet and for him to get a sense of my family dynamics. However, during dinner, my parents brought up the topic of marriage, specifically asking when we were planning to get engaged. I felt uncomfortable because I knew they were trying to pressure me.

Instead of just brushing it off, I got annoyed and snapped at my parents, saying, ""It's none of your business when we get engaged! We’re doing things our way, and you should respect that."" My boyfriend looked shocked, and the atmosphere turned tense. My parents were taken aback and quiet for the rest of the dinner.

Afterward, my boyfriend told me that he felt I overreacted and embarrassed him in front of my family. He said he understood my frustration with my parents, but there are better ways to handle it without causing a scene. I argued that I was just standing up for our choices, but he pointed out that I could have chosen a more diplomatic approach.

However, I started to realize how much I would be in debt after the wedding. I brought it up again, expressing my concerns about the financial strain, but she got upset and accused me of not being supportive.

However, there's a catch: I don't think she should be co-sleeping with her baby. I've read a lot about safe sleep practices, and I firmly believe that babies should be in their own crib for their safety. When I mentioned this to my sister, she got really defensive. She loves co-sleeping and says it helps them bond and makes her baby sleep better.

I told her that if she didn't change her sleeping arrangement, I wouldn’t babysit for her. I thought I was being a good brother by trying to keep her baby safe, but now she feels like I’m judging her parenting skills. She’s really upset with me, and I didn’t mean for it to come off that way. My family is divided; some think I was right to stand my ground, while others think I overstepped.

You're the Asshole,"I (24F) recently got into a bit of a messy situation with my best friend, Sarah (25F). We've been friends since high school and share a close bond. A few months ago, Sarah got a promotion at work, and to celebrate, she planned a weekend getaway to a beach resort. She invited me along, and I was super excited.

However, a couple of weeks before the trip, I had a family emergency that required me to fly out of state to help my parents. I was really stressed and overwhelmed, and I couldn’t make it to the trip. I sent Sarah a message explaining the situation and apologized for not being able to join her. I thought she would understand and we would plan something else together.

To my surprise, she was really upset about it. She told me that she had already booked a hotel room for the two of us and that she expected me to pay my half, which was around $400, even if I didn’t go. I was shocked because I thought that since I wasn’t attending, I shouldn’t have to pay anything. 

In hindsight, I should have anticipated that she might feel differently, but I felt that it was unfair of her to expect me to pay for a trip I wasn't going on. I decided to stick to my guns and told her that I wouldn’t be sending her any money since I didn’t go, and it didn't seem right to pay for something I didn’t benefit from.

This caused a huge rift between us. She accused me of being selfish and not valuing our friendship. I feel bad, but I still think I’m justified in my decision. My other friends have mixed opinions, with some agreeing with me and others saying I should just pay her to keep the peace.

One night, as we were having dinner, I casually brought up how I felt uncomfortable with her spending so much time with him. I told her I thought it was inappropriate for her to be so close to another man, especially when I’m not around. I suggested that she should distance herself from him because it made me feel insecure. I argued that she wouldn’t want me to have a close friendship with a woman, so why should she have one with a guy?

She got really upset and said I was being controlling and that her friendship with him was purely platonic. I insisted that I was just looking out for our relationship and that it was important for her to prioritize what we have over a friendship that I didn’t feel comfortable with.

Last week, a regular customer named Sarah, who I know well, came in and ordered her usual—a large caramel macchiato. While she was waiting, she realized she had forgotten her wallet at home. She seemed really stressed and worried about how she would pay for her drink.

Seeing her in distress, I decided to help her out. I told her not to worry and that I would cover her drink this time. However, I made a joke about how she owed me a ""favor"" in return. I not only expected her to pay me back eventually but also thought it would be funny if she brought me a little treat next time, like a pastry or something.

After she finished her drink, she thanked me profusely and left. Later that day, I told my co-workers about how I covered Sarah’s drink and how I joked about her bringing me something the next time. One of my co-workers pointed out that I was kind of putting her in an awkward position by joking about expecting something in return for my kindness.

I brushed it off, thinking it was all in good humor. However, when I saw Sarah again a few days later, she looked a bit uncomfortable. I asked her if she brought me anything, and she laughed it off, but I could tell she felt pressured. I decided to tell her I was just kidding, but honestly, I was a bit disappointed she didn’t bring me anything.

Since then, she’s been completely consumed with motherhood, which I totally understand, but I feel like she’s forgotten about everyone else in her life. I’ve tried to reach out several times to check in on her and offer help, but she rarely responds, and when she does, it’s usually just a brief message.

A couple of weeks ago, I was planning a small get-together for a few friends and thought it would be nice to include my sister. I messaged her, excitedly inviting her and asking if she could bring the baby. To my surprise, she replied that she wouldn’t be able to make it because she was still figuring out the whole motherhood thing and didn’t want to stress herself out just yet.

Feeling frustrated, I snapped back and told her that it’s not like she was the only one who had a life change and it would be nice if she could make an effort to show up for family things instead of shutting us out. I told her it seemed like she was using the baby as an excuse to isolate herself. I said she needed to balance her new role with her relationships, and it was selfish of her to ignore us just because she had a baby.

My sister was really hurt by my words and said I was being insensitive and unrealistic. She said she’s trying her best, and it’s not easy for her right now.

You're the Asshole,"This happened last summer, and it still makes me cringe when I think about it. My friends and I decided to have a barbecue at the park, and everyone was bringing a dish. I was responsible for the burgers, which I was really excited about. I love cooking and wanted to impress everyone with my grilling skills.

The day of the barbecue, I went all out. I marinated the patties, brought my special seasoning, and even made a homemade barbecue sauce. When we got to the park, I set everything up and started grilling while my friends set up the picnic area. 

As I was grilling, I noticed that my friend Sarah was bringing out a bunch of pre-packaged veggie burgers. Now, I know a lot of people are into plant-based diets, but I find them so bland and unappetizing. When I saw her setting them up, I couldn’t help but express my disdain. I made a loud comment, ""Who actually eats those tasteless things? You're ruining the barbecue with that stuff!""

I thought I was joking, but the atmosphere changed. Sarah looked hurt, and a couple of other friends chuckled awkwardly. I brushed it off, thinking they were just being overly sensitive. Later, when it was time to eat, I served up my burgers proudly, but when Sarah went to grab a veggie burger, I jokingly leaned over and said, ""You'll regret that choice. Real burgers are where it's at!""

Afterward, I noticed Sarah didn't eat much and seemed upset. A few days later, she texted me saying how my comments made her feel unwelcome and hurt, especially since she really enjoys her veggie burgers and had brought them for everyone to try. I brushed it off again, thinking I was just being playful.

So, a little background: I’m a huge gamer, and I’ve been looking forward to the release of a new game for months. It was finally set to drop on June 15th, and I made plans to take the day off work to play it as soon as it was available. My girlfriend, Sarah, knew how excited I was and was supportive—at least, that’s what I thought.

A week before the game’s release, Sarah told me that her parents were coming to visit for the weekend. I knew I couldn’t just blow them off, so I agreed to spend time with them. However, I clearly communicated that I wanted to have some time to play the game when it came out. I figured I could game after they left for dinner or something.

June 15th arrived, and Sarah’s parents got to our place around noon. We spent some time together, but as the hours passed, I started getting anxious about the game. Finally, when her parents were settled in and Sarah was cooking dinner, I decided to sneak off to play the game. I thought it would just be for an hour or so, and I’d come back to join them.

I ended up getting really absorbed in the game, and before I knew it, two hours had passed. Sarah came into the room, furious. She said I was being incredibly rude to her parents by abandoning them and playing video games. I told her to relax, that I was just taking a little time for myself. She argued that it was disrespectful and that I should have been more present.

Things escalated, and I snapped. I told her that I had been looking forward to this game for months and that I had made it clear I wanted to play. I accused her of ruining my excitement and that she should have planned the visit for a different weekend if she knew how important this was to me. 

Now, she’s upset with me, and her parents are disappointed because they feel like I didn’t want to spend time with them. I thought I was just taking a break, but now I feel like I might have crossed a line.

I told her about how I always come to this shop and should be rewarded for my loyalty.

After she still refused, I got really upset and demanded that she give me my money back for the drink because I didn’t think it was fair.

I was loud enough that people started looking at us, which made me feel even more justified, thinking I was standing up for my rights as a customer.

Instead of helping her find a solution, I suggested that we just go to a bakery and buy some cupcakes instead, thinking it would be less stressful.

However, when she announced that she wanted to have her wedding in a luxurious venue that would cost her family a small fortune, I couldn't help but express my concerns. I told her that it seemed excessive and that she should consider a more intimate celebration instead, like a backyard wedding. I even went so far as to suggest that she could save the money for a down payment on a house or invest it in their future.

Sarah was visibly upset by my comments. She said this was her dream and that she had every right to have the wedding she wanted. I didn’t really think about how my words might have hurt her feelings; I was too focused on what I thought was practical.

As the wedding planning progressed, I continued to make offhand comments about how much money she was spending, saying things like, “You know you could have a really nice vacation instead” or “I just think it’s crazy to spend so much on one day.” I thought I was just being honest and looking out for her best interest, but now I realize I may have been a bit harsh.

When she uninvited me to the wedding, I was shocked and hurt. I thought I was being a good friend by trying to help her see the bigger picture. My other friends have since told me that I was being insensitive and should have just supported her decision instead of pushing my own views on her.

So, AITA for voicing my opinions on my friend’s wedding plans, even if I thought I was helping?",585,746,0.86,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_20301,2024-08-24 00:00:00,YTA,1706,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I (28M) recently got into a pretty heated argument with my sister (26F) over a family gathering. Our parents decided to throw a big birthday party for our mom, and they invited the whole family. I was excited because I love spending time with everyone, but I found out that my sister was planning to bring her new boyfriend, who I really can't stand. 

I’ve always been upfront about my feelings towards him; I just think he’s arrogant and disrespectful. Last time I saw him, he made some rude comments about my job, and I’m still bitter about it. So, when I heard he was coming to the party, I texted my sister asking if she could leave him at home. I told her that I really didn’t want him to ruin the day for me and our family.

She was understandably upset and told me that it was unfair to ask her to choose between her boyfriend and her family. I told her I wasn’t trying to make her choose but that I just wanted to enjoy the party without feeling uncomfortable. I also said that if he’s there, I might just skip the event altogether. 

After some back and forth, she finally told me that I was being selfish and that I should try to get along with him if I wanted to be a part of the family. I didn’t like that at all, and I snapped back that I didn’t see why I should have to tolerate someone who disrespects me, even if he's dating my sister. 

In the end, she decided to stick with her plans and bring him, and I told her that if he’s coming, I won’t be there. My parents were disappointed with both of us, and now I feel like I might have overreacted by trying to dictate who can come to the family gathering. 

TL;DR - I asked my sister to leave her boyfriend at home for our mom's birthday party because I don't like him, and when she refused, I threatened to skip the party. Am I the asshole?",293,1198,0.91,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_91672,2018-05-24 00:00:00,YTA,1807,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I recently got a new job that required me to move to a different city. I had been living in a shared apartment with three other people for about a year, and we generally got along. When I found out about the job, I let my roommates know that I would be moving out in a month.

My roommates were understanding, but they were also a bit worried about how they would cover the rent once I left since I was one of the ones paying a larger share due to my bigger room. To make things easier for them, I offered to help them find a new roommate and even suggested some of my friends who might be looking for a place.

I packed up my things over the course of the month, and on the last day before my move, I decided to have a small farewell gathering at the apartment with a few friends. I invited my roommates as well, but they seemed annoyed and said they wanted to keep things low-key since they still had to live there after I left. I brushed off their feelings, thinking it was just a small get-together and they would come around.

During the gathering, I ended up drinking a bit too much and made some jokes about how they wouldn’t be able to handle my absence, which led to some tension. At one point, I took it too far and joked about how they’d miss my cooking, even though I knew one of my roommates had been trying to learn to cook herself but often burnt things. She got upset, and the atmosphere turned awkward.

After the gathering, I did my final clean-up, but I noticed my roommates were still visibly upset. I told them they were being overly dramatic about me moving out and that they should just get used to it. I left the next morning without really resolving anything, and I felt like I had been unfairly criticized.

A few days later, I got a message from one of my roommates saying they felt hurt by my comments and that it wasn't cool to make fun of them, especially on my last night. I replied that they were being too sensitive and should just be happy for me.

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for about four years, and while we’ve talked about marriage, we haven’t taken that step yet. 

Last week, Emma invited me to dinner to celebrate her engagement, and I thought it would be a great opportunity to share my feelings about my own relationship. During the dinner, she was glowing and sharing all her wedding plans. I decided to bring up my situation by saying something like, “It’s great you’re engaged, but I feel like I’m never going to get married if this continues.” I said it jokingly, but I could tell Emma was a bit put off. 

Instead of letting it go, I kept pushing. I started comparing our relationships, saying things like, “I mean, you’re getting married, but I don’t even have a ring yet!” I wanted her to understand that I felt left behind. The conversation got awkward, and Emma ended up in tears, saying that she didn’t want me to ruin her engagement celebration with my jealousy.

To celebrate her achievement, our parents threw her a graduation party and invited family and friends to join in the festivities. I wanted to do something special for her, so I decided to give her a personalized gift that she would treasure forever.

My sister is a big fan of a popular book series, and I thought it would be a great idea to get a rare, signed first edition of one of the books as her graduation present. I found the book online and, without telling her, I purchased it and had it wrapped nicely.

On the day of the party, I presented her with the gift in front of everyone. I was excited to see her reaction, but her smile quickly turned to confusion and then disappointment. She opened the gift and revealed the book, but instead of being thrilled, she looked upset. She told me that while she appreciated the gesture, she had been saving up money to buy that same book herself because it was a big deal for her.

She felt that I had taken away the enjoyment of earning the book herself, and she was frustrated that I hadn't consulted her first. I tried to explain that I just wanted to surprise her and show her how proud I was of her, but she ended up leaving the party early and didn't want to talk to me for the rest of the night.

You're the Asshole,"Title: AITA for wanting to have my wedding in a facility that my fiancé's family doesn't approve of?

I (28F) am planning my wedding with my fiancé (30M). We’re both really excited about it, and we want to make the day special for us. I found a beautiful venue that I absolutely love—it's a cozy, rustic barn that has a gorgeous outdoor space and fits our budget perfectly. 

However, my fiancé's parents are very traditional and have always envisioned a big, formal wedding in a fancy hotel. When I mentioned the barn to them, they were visibly disappointed and said that it wouldn't be appropriate for their son, and it's not how they imagined his wedding day. They even suggested that we should reconsider our venue choice and go with something more upscale to make it a “real” wedding in their eyes.

I understand that my fiancé's parents have their own ideas about what a wedding should look like, but this is our day, and we want it to reflect our personalities and our relationship. I feel that if we choose a venue that they approve of just to appease them, it will end up being a day about them instead of us. 

After discussing this with my fiancé, he agreed with me that the barn is perfect for us, but he also seems to be feeling the pressure from his family. He told me that he wants to keep the peace and that he's worried about how his parents will react if we go through with the barn venue. I can sense that he feels torn between supporting my vision and not wanting to upset his family.

I told him that I believe we should stand firm on our choice because we shouldn’t let their opinions dictate what should be a joyful occasion for us. I might have come off a bit harsh when I said that I didn't care about their approval. I could have been more considerate about how he feels regarding his family. I started to think that maybe I have been selfish, especially since they had a big wedding and seem to want the same for their son.

Now I'm questioning whether I’m being unreasonable for wanting the wedding that I envisioned, even if it means disappointing my fiancé's parents.

Recently, Sarah mentioned she wanted to adopt a cat. I was immediately against it because I have severe allergies to cats. I told her that it would be too much of a hassle and that I wouldn’t be able to live comfortably in our apartment with a cat around. Sarah seemed really excited about the idea and tried to explain how she could take care of the cat and keep it away from my room, but I just couldn't see it working. 

Instead of discussing it further, I decided to take things into my own hands. I went online and found a pet adoption agency. I filled out an application pretending to be Sarah and submitted it. I thought that if I could prevent her from getting a cat, it would be better for both of us. I assumed she would appreciate my effort to protect our living situation.

A few days later, Sarah received a call from the agency saying her application had been approved and she could come pick up her new cat. She was over the moon! But when she found out that I had lied and filled out the application without her knowledge, she was furious. She felt betrayed and said she could no longer trust me. 

I tried to explain that I was only trying to protect our living environment and that I thought she would ultimately thank me for it. I know I shouldn’t have done it, but I genuinely thought it was for the best. 

Now I feel terrible about the whole situation. I never meant to hurt her, but I also don't think I should be blamed for wanting to keep our home comfortable for both of us.

I think it's around $5 more than my usual order, but I’m excited to try it.

While I'm waiting for my drink, I notice a woman sitting by herself with a small child who is clearly restless and grumpy. She’s trying to keep him entertained, but he’s starting to get fussy. I start chatting with my friends and forget about the woman and her kid.

You're the Asshole,"I (28M) recently got into a big argument with my girlfriend (27F) over her dog, Max. When we started dating, she mentioned that Max had been her companion through some tough times, and she loved him dearly. I’ve always appreciated animals, but I’ve never had a pet of my own, so I didn’t fully understand the bond she shared with Max.

Things were going well for a while, but then I started feeling a bit overwhelmed with Max around. He tends to bark a lot when I’m trying to relax at home, and he needs a lot of attention. I’ve tried to be supportive, but after a long day at work, it’s tough to come home to a dog that requires constant attention and walks. I suggested a few times that maybe she could take him to training classes to help with his behavior, but she brushed it off, saying he was just being a dog.

One day, after I had a particularly exhausting week, I snapped. I told her that I didn’t want to deal with Max anymore and suggested she should consider rehoming him if she couldn't manage his behavior. I didn’t think she’d take it seriously, but she got really upset and started crying, saying that Max was her family and that I shouldn’t have said such a thing. I rolled my eyes and told her that she was being dramatic, and that it was just a suggestion.

Now, we’re not speaking properly, and she’s been distant. I feel like I was just being honest about how I felt, and she’s overreacting. I keep thinking that if she truly loved me, she would understand where I was coming from. I’m starting to wonder if maybe I should just get used to Max instead of expecting her to make changes.

You're the Asshole,"So, I have a friend named Sarah who has been going through a tough time lately. She recently lost her job, and I wanted to cheer her up. I decided to throw a small dinner party at my place and invite a few close friends, including her.

I sent out group texts to all my friends and planned for everyone to arrive around 7 PM. I told Sarah it would just be a cozy evening with some good food and company, hoping it would lift her spirits.

The day of the dinner, I was feeling a bit anxious because I wanted everything to be perfect. I had cooked a nice meal and set up some games for us to play afterward. However, I had a couple of other friends who I hadn’t planned on inviting come over early, and we started drinking and hanging out. By the time Sarah arrived at 7:30 PM, the vibe had shifted. 

She walked in and found me and about eight other friends all laughing and drinking, and I could see her face drop. It was clear she wasn’t expecting this kind of gathering. I tried to introduce her around, but she seemed overwhelmed and just awkwardly stood by the door for a moment.

Instead of addressing how she might be feeling, I brushed it off and kept trying to get her to engage with the group. I even suggested we play one of the games I had planned, but she just shook her head and sat down quietly, scrolling through her phone. The evening progressed, and I kept joking around with my other friends, not really paying much attention to her.

At one point, I noticed she had gotten up and was heading towards the door. I asked her where she was going, and she said she was leaving. I tried to convince her to stay, saying it was all in good fun and that she needed to lighten up. I ended up saying something like, ""Come on, it’s not that serious. We’re just having fun!"" She just gave me a look and walked out without saying another word.

Now I’m left wondering if I was an asshole for not considering her feelings and just going ahead with what I wanted instead of what she needed. I feel bad, but I thought she would enjoy the surprise. So, AITA here?",874,2027,0.7,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_45637,2024-03-20 00:00:00,YTA,2064,AITA
You're the Asshole,"A few months ago, I (29F) was invited to a friend’s wedding. The bride, Jessica, is one of my closest friends, and I was really looking forward to celebrating with her. A couple of weeks before the wedding, I found out that a mutual friend, Mia (30F), who I haven’t been on great terms with lately, would also be attending. Mia and I had a falling out over a misunderstanding regarding a group trip where I felt she undermined my efforts in planning.

Despite our issues, I decided to go to the wedding and just avoid Mia. However, on the day of the wedding, I saw Mia sitting at a table with some other friends and it struck me that I wanted to confront her. I walked over, and instead of just saying hello or keeping it civil, I let my frustrations out. I accused her of being selfish and ruining our trip, and I made a scene in front of other guests.

Jessica, the bride, tried to intervene, but I was too heated. I ended up dragging Jessica into our argument, claiming she always took Mia’s side and it wasn’t fair. The wedding was disrupted, and I could see other guests looking uncomfortable.

After that, I felt really bad about ruining the wedding vibe. I tried to reach out to Jessica afterward to apologize, but she told me that my actions made her day incredibly stressful and that I had embarrassed her in front of her family and friends. I also texted Mia to apologize, but she said she didn’t want to talk to me anymore.

Now I'm left feeling guilty and confused. I was upset about what had happened in the past, but did I really need to confront Mia at such an important event?

You're the Asshole,"My best friend has been planning her wedding for over a year now, and I’m one of her bridesmaids. She’s been super excited about every detail, and I was really happy for her. However, there’s a big part of the wedding she didn’t see coming: my sister is getting married just a month before her.

My sister’s wedding is a smaller, more low-key affair, but it’s still a big deal for our family. My friend has been pretty understanding about me needing to help my sister with planning and preparations, but I’ve been stressed trying to balance both.

When my friend sent out her invitations, she included a note about a dress code: formal and a specific color scheme. I realized I didn’t have anything that fit the requirements and was worried about spending more money on a dress since I’ve already spent a lot on my sister’s wedding.

So, I decided to go online and order a dress in the color my friend wanted, but I made a choice that I now regret. I ordered a cheaper dress that was on sale, and it arrived just a few days ago. The problem is, the dress looks awful on me. I didn’t want to spend much time searching for the perfect one since I was burned out from dealing with my sister’s wedding, and I thought my friend would understand.

When I showed her the dress, she was clearly disappointed. She said it didn’t fit the vibe she was going for and asked if I could at least try to find something nicer. I snapped and told her that I was doing my best and that she should be grateful I’m even making an effort. I told her she was being too picky and that it was just a dress.

Now she’s upset, and I feel terrible. I thought I was just being practical, but I realize I hurt her feelings. AITA?",157,2737,0.57,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_48577,2022-05-25 00:00:00,YTA,1699,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I (F, 28) recently had a birthday party and decided to invite my close friends and family to celebrate. One of my friends, Sarah (F, 27), has a daughter (Emily, F, 5) who is adorable, but her behavior can be a bit much sometimes. I love kids, but Emily has a tendency to be a little loud and wild, and I was worried that she would disrupt the adult conversations we planned to have.

A few days before the party, I texted Sarah to let her know how excited I was to see her but asked if she could find a sitter for Emily so that we could enjoy a more adult atmosphere. I thought that since it was a birthday celebration, it would be better to keep it kid-free. I didn’t want to hurt her feelings, but I really wanted to have a relaxed evening without any distractions.

Sarah responded saying that she didn’t have anyone to watch Emily and that she was really looking forward to bringing her along. I felt bad, but I insisted that it was my party and I really wanted it to be adults only. I told her that it would mean a lot to me if she could find a way to make it happen.

On the day of the party, Sarah showed up with Emily anyway, despite my request. I was frustrated and didn’t hide it well. I spent most of the evening trying to keep Emily occupied and away from the other guests, which took away from my time with my friends. At one point, I snapped at Sarah, saying I had specifically asked her to leave Emily with a sitter, and that it was really inconsiderate of her to just show up with her.

You're the Asshole,"I (30M) recently got into a new relationship with my girlfriend (28F), and everything was going well until a situation arose involving my cat, Whiskers. I’ve had Whiskers for over 10 years, and he’s really important to me. He’s a bit of a diva and can be sensitive to changes in his environment.

A couple of weeks ago, my girlfriend came over to my place for the weekend. I usually keep Whiskers in my bedroom when I have guests, as he can be a bit overwhelmed by new people. My girlfriend, however, insisted that we should just let him roam free and “get used to her.” I was hesitant but agreed to let him out while we were both in the living room. 

At first, everything seemed fine, but then Whiskers started acting strangely. He was hiding under the couch, which is unusual for him. My girlfriend, not noticing the signs, was trying to coax him out and even tried to pet him. This obviously made him more anxious, and he eventually hissed at her and ran off. 

When I saw this, I got really upset and told her that I told her to let him come to her on his own terms. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic. I snapped back, saying I was just trying to protect my cat and that she should respect his boundaries. She got defensive, saying it was just a cat and I was overreacting.

Later that evening, things escalated. I was still feeling bad about what happened with Whiskers and mentioned it again, hoping she would understand. Instead, she started mocking me, saying it's just a pet and that I should “get over it.” I yelled at her, telling her that she was being inconsiderate and that I didn't appreciate her attitude towards something that matters to me.

After that, she stormed out and went home, saying she didn't want to be with someone who was so overly attached to an animal. I felt frustrated and hurt. I did apologize later, but I still think she should have listened to me about Whiskers.

You're the Asshole,"I (28M) recently faced a conflict with my best friend, Mike (29M), that has left me feeling frustrated and justified in my actions, but I’ve started to wonder if I might actually be the asshole.

So, here’s the situation. Mike and I have been friends for over a decade. We’ve always been there for each other, but in recent years, I feel like I’ve been the one putting in more effort to keep our friendship alive. I’m the one who usually plans our hangouts and makes an effort to check in on him. He tends to be more laid back and doesn’t really reciprocate.

A few months ago, I planned a birthday party for myself and invited Mike along with a bunch of friends. I really wanted it to be special since I was turning 30. I went all out with decorations, food, and even a cake. I spent a lot of time and money on it because I wanted to create great memories.

The night of the party, Mike texted me saying he couldn't make it because he had a last-minute family obligation. I was disappointed but understood that family comes first. However, I noticed he was on social media later that night posting pictures from a party he organized for a mutual friend. I felt betrayed because it seemed like he had prioritized someone else over me, especially since I had gone out of my way to celebrate my milestone.

After the party, I confronted Mike about it. I told him how hurt I felt that he chose to attend that party instead of mine. He apologized, but he also mentioned that he felt like I was being dramatic and that it wasn’t a big deal. This upset me even more. I ended up saying some pretty harsh things, like questioning his loyalty and how he never really appreciated our friendship. I told him that I was tired of always feeling like I was the one who cared more.

Now, Mike hasn’t really reached out since our conversation, and I’ve been feeling guilty about how I handled it. I do think he should have made more of an effort to come to my party, but maybe I overreacted. I’ve been considering reaching out and apologizing for my outburst, but part of me feels like I was justified in feeling hurt.

He's married to a wonderful woman, and they have a cute little family together. Recently, they invited me over for dinner to celebrate their anniversary, and I was excited to spend time with them.

The thing is, I’ve been trying really hard to get in shape and eat healthier. I recently started a new diet and exercise routine, and I'm really committed to it. So when I arrived at their house for dinner, I was surprised to see that they had ordered a ton of greasy pizza. I didn’t want to be rude, but I felt really tempted. 

As the evening went on, I started to feel left out while everyone enjoyed the pizza. My sister-in-law offered me a salad they had made, but it just felt so inadequate compared to the pizza. I wanted to have fun with them and not feel like the odd one out.

So, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I went into their kitchen and grabbed a couple of slices of pizza, and then I started taking pictures of myself eating it and posting them on social media with captions like ""Who cares about diets when there’s pizza?! #YOLO"". I thought it would be funny and lighthearted.

My brother and sister-in-law were really upset with me. My brother told me that they had put a lot of effort into making the evening special, and I had just made a joke out of it.

As the planning went on, my friend mentioned that she wanted to keep the guest list small and intimate, which I completely understood. However, when she told me that she only invited a handful of people, I was surprised to find out that I wasn’t on the list.

For context, Rachel and I have been friends since high school, and I’ve always been there for her through thick and thin. Last month, she decided to throw a surprise birthday party for her boyfriend, and she asked me to help her plan it. I was totally on board and excited to help organize everything.

As we were planning, I suggested we make it a themed party, and I specifically recommended a retro 90s theme since I know her boyfriend loves that era. I even offered to take charge of decorations and music. Rachel agreed, and we started working on the details together.

A few weeks later, I was scrolling through social media when I saw Rachel post a beautiful invitation for the party. To my surprise, the theme was completely different—she had changed it to a tropical beach theme, which I thought was pretty generic and didn’t reflect her boyfriend's personality at all. I felt hurt and slighted because I had put a lot of effort into planning the 90s theme, thinking it would be special.

So, I decided to confront her about it. I sent her a message saying that I was disappointed she chose a different theme without discussing it with me first, especially since I had put so much thought into the original idea. Instead of understanding my feelings, she snapped back that I was being controlling and that it was her party, so she could choose whatever theme she wanted. I was taken aback by her response and felt like she was dismissing my contributions.

In the heat of the moment, I told her that if she didn't appreciate my help or my ideas, then maybe I shouldn't help her at all. I ended up backing out of the party completely. Now, Rachel is upset, saying that I’m being dramatic and that I should have just gone with the flow.

She left her belongings everywhere, and I noticed Jake was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the situation. He politely asked me to talk to her about keeping the shared spaces tidy, but I brushed it off, insisting that Sarah needed this time to heal.

After dinner, I overheard some of them making comments about how they didn't enjoy the food and how they were disappointed. I felt bad but also a little defensive, so I jokingly said, ""Well, this is what happens when you eat vegetarian food!"" 

Later, Sarah pulled me aside and expressed that she was hurt by my comment. She felt embarrassed that her dish was criticized, especially since she had put effort into making it. Instead of apologizing, I brushed it off and told her she was being too sensitive and that it was just a joke. 

Now, Sarah hasn’t been as responsive to my texts, and I feel like I've created some distance in our friendship. A few of our mutual friends have even mentioned that I should reach out and apologize, but I think she needs to lighten up.

You're the Asshole,"So a bit of context:

I’ve been friends with Sarah for about five years, and she recently started dating someone new, Mark. I was excited for her but had some reservations because I had heard from mutual friends that he can be pretty rude and dismissive. I decided to express my concerns to Sarah, hoping she'd be careful.

When she brushed me off, I felt really frustrated. I didn’t want to see her get hurt, so I took it upon myself to “protect” her. I started subtly undermining Mark whenever he was around. I would make little comments about how he seemed to treat her poorly, or I would bring up stories of toxic relationships to make her think twice about him. I even went as far as to gather some of our friends and we confronted her about Mark, insisting that she deserved better.

Sarah was clearly upset and confused. She told me that I was being overdramatic and that she liked Mark, but I just couldn't back off. I kept pushing my opinion, wanting her to see what I saw. I thought I was helping her, but it only pushed her away. She eventually told me that she didn’t want to talk to me about her relationship anymore, and that hurt my feelings.

Now, looking back, I see that I might have overstepped and was being controlling. I was just worried about her, but I think I crossed a line into being manipulative and unsupportive.

You're the Asshole,"I (F35) have a younger sister (F28) who recently got engaged to her long-term boyfriend. I’ve always been somewhat controlling and have a hard time letting go of the idea that I know what’s best for my family. When my sister announced the engagement, I was initially happy for her, but then I started to think about how the wedding would affect me.

She mentioned wanting a small, intimate wedding, and I couldn’t wrap my head around that. I’ve always envisioned a big, lavish wedding in our family, and I thought it would be a shame if she settled for less just because she was trying to save money. So, I took it upon myself to plan a more extravagant engagement party without consulting her. I booked a venue, arranged catering, and invited a lot of family and friends. I did all of this thinking I was being supportive and helping her out.

When I told her about the party, she was taken aback and said she wanted to keep things low-key and personal. I dismissed her concerns, saying I knew what was best for her and that she would thank me later for throwing such a fantastic event. I insisted that this would be a celebration she’d never forget, and I pressured her to go along with it.

On the day of the engagement party, she looked unhappy. She tried to mingle with her fiancé and friends, but I kept directing her attention to the activities I had planned. I even had a ridiculous photo booth set up, which she thought was silly and not her style. She ended up in tears when she realized that this wasn’t the celebration she had envisioned and felt like I had stolen her moment.

After the party, she confronted me about how I had completely disregarded her feelings and desires. I told her that I was just trying to make her happy and that she would see how great it was in the end. Instead, she became distant and hasn’t spoken to me much since. Our parents are caught in the middle and think I overstepped, but I really believed my intentions were good.

Now, my sister is unsure if she even wants me involved in her wedding planning or if she will invite me at all. I feel like I’ve ruined our relationship over this, but I can’t help but think that I was only trying to help her create the best memories.

I thought it would be funny to challenge him to a little soccer game outside since he seemed really excited about it. However, I wanted to make it a bit more interesting.

When we got outside, I dared him to take a penalty shot against me, but I told him I would be blindfolded. I thought it would be hilarious and that he would have a good time. My cousin agreed, and I put on the blindfold. But instead of just letting him shoot normally, I decided to really get into it and purposefully dive in the wrong direction when he kicked the ball, pretending to be super surprised whenever he scored.

The problem is that I completely misjudged the power he would kick the ball with. He ended up kicking it way harder than I expected, and it hit me right in the face. I was shocked and embarrassed, but instead of just laughing it off, I yelled at him that he should have been more careful and that he needed to learn to control the ball better. My aunt and uncle were really upset with me for yelling at him, and my cousin looked devastated.

I ended up ruining the fun for everyone, and my family told me that I shouldn't have reacted that way, that I should have just acted like an adult about it.

Recently, Emma reached out to me for help with a presentation she had to give to her bosses. I agreed to help her prepare, but when I got to her place, I ended up taking over the entire presentation. I created the slides, wrote out her talking points, and even practiced her delivery with her. I was feeling really proud of the work we were doing together, thinking I was really helping her out.

When she presented to her team, I was shocked to hear that she received a lot of praise for how well it went. Her bosses complimented her on her hard work and impressive presentation skills. I felt a twinge of jealousy; I had put in so much effort, but she got all the credit. Instead of being happy for her, I confronted her about it later that week.

I’ve tried various diets over the years, but nothing ever stuck. Recently, I decided to take my health seriously and lost a significant amount of weight—about 60 pounds. I’ve been feeling great and have more confidence than ever.

My best friend, Lisa, has always been supportive of me, but she’s also been on her own journey with weight and body image. She’s tried losing weight multiple times but has struggled to maintain it. I know it’s been hard for her, and I’ve tried to encourage her, but I’ve never pushed too hard because I don’t want to make her feel worse.

Last week, we were hanging out, and I was feeling really proud of my progress. I started talking about my weight loss journey and how I’ve been doing it. I mentioned some of the diets and workouts I’ve been doing, thinking it might inspire her. As I continued to talk about my success, I noticed that Lisa was getting quieter and more withdrawn.

Suddenly, she snapped at me and said that I was being insensitive, flaunting my success while she was still struggling. I brushed it off and told her that I was just trying to share what worked for me. I thought I was being helpful, but she got really upset and told me that I was being a jerk for not considering her feelings.

The other night, we went out to dinner with some friends, and I made a comment about how he should consider getting a haircut because he looks like a ""disheveled rock star."" Everyone laughed, including him, but I noticed he looked a bit uncomfortable afterward. I shrugged it off, thinking he was just being self-deprecating.

Later, we were hanging out at his place, and I brought up the haircut joke again, saying something like, “But really, you’d be so much hotter if you cleaned yourself up a bit.” He didn’t laugh this time and just looked at me kind of blankly. I asked if I had offended him, and he said it was just a little hurtful, but I insisted he was overreacting and that it was just my sense of humor.

She was visibly frustrated and said she really wanted to watch the rom-com since she had been looking forward to it. But I insisted, saying that it would be more fun for me and that she should just watch it another time. I ended up grabbing the remote and switching the movie anyway.

She didn’t say anything but I could tell she was upset. After about half an hour into the horror movie, she got up and left the room. I thought she might just need a break or something, but she didn’t come back for the rest of the night.

He’s really excited about it, and I’m proud of him, but I’m also feeling a bit neglected since he’s been focused on work.

The backstory

I've been dating my girlfriend for about a year and a half. We're both in our late twenties and have a pretty good relationship overall. We communicate well, share similar interests, and enjoy spending time together. However, there's one issue that has been bothering me lately: her relationship with her friends, particularly one friend, Sarah.

Sarah is someone I find to be quite toxic. She often encourages my girlfriend to go out and party, and I feel like she influences her to make some questionable choices. My girlfriend has a great career and is usually responsible, but whenever she's with Sarah, she tends to get caught up in the moment and neglect her responsibilities. I've expressed my concerns to my girlfriend about Sarah's influence, but she insists that Sarah is just fun and doesn't mean any harm.

The main story

Last weekend, my girlfriend and I had planned a nice evening together—dinner, a movie, and some quality time. However, the day before, Sarah invited her out for an impromptu party. My girlfriend, excited about the chance to socialize, decided to cancel our plans. I was disappointed, but I tried to be understanding. 

During the party, I repeatedly texted my girlfriend to check in, but she barely responded. I could tell she was having a great time, which only made me feel worse. When she finally came home late that night, she was drunk and loud, and I couldn’t help but express my frustration. I told her that I felt unimportant and that she always prioritizes Sarah over me. 

In the heat of the moment, I brought up some of the bad decisions I believed Sarah had led her to make in the past—like when she skipped work for a last-minute trip—which my girlfriend took as a personal attack. We ended up arguing, and I said things I regret, implying she’s irresponsible and can’t make her own decisions without Sarah’s influence.

Afterward, my girlfriend was upset, saying I was being controlling and that I should trust her to manage her own friendships. I felt justified in my concerns, but now I’m unsure if my approach was just too harsh. AITA?

Sarah has always been a bit more carefree than I am—she’s spontaneous and doesn’t really think much before she acts. I admire her for that, but it can lead to issues sometimes.

Recently, Sarah got invited to a big party and asked if she could borrow my favorite dress. I hesitated but eventually agreed because I wanted her to have fun and look great. I made her promise to be careful with it since it’s really special to me—I’ve worn it to weddings and important events.

A week later, I saw Sarah again and noticed my dress was returned to me, but it was stained and wrinkled. I was furious! I confronted her about it, and she casually said she spilled some drinks on it but thought it would wash out. I couldn’t believe how careless she was! I told her that she should have respected my things and taken better care of them, but she just brushed it off and said it was no big deal.

Feeling hurt and angry, I decided to retaliate. I went to her apartment while she was at work and took back some of my things I had lent her over time—books, a couple of kitchen gadgets, even some makeup I had let her borrow. I left her a note saying that if she can’t respect my belongings, then I won’t respect hers either.

You're the Asshole,"I have a younger sister who has been struggling with her weight for a few years now. She's been trying different diets and exercising, but she often gets discouraged and feels bad about herself. I’ve always been relatively fit and I’ve worked hard to maintain my body, so I sometimes catch myself making comments that I don’t really think about. For instance, I often mention how I’m going to the gym or how I’ve cooked a healthy meal, sometimes jokingly saying things like, “You should try it too!” 

Recently, she confided in me that my comments make her feel worse about her journey and that she wishes I would be more sensitive to her feelings. I understood where she was coming from, but I thought it was just a little friendly motivation. I mean, I’m just trying to be honest about what works for me. 

When I planned a family dinner and decided to serve a variety of dishes, I made sure to include a lot of healthy options. I jokingly told her, “Don’t worry, I made sure there’s plenty of salad for you!” She didn’t laugh and instead looked really upset. My parents told me I should apologize, but I think she needs to toughen up a bit. I didn’t mean any harm, and I just wanted to share what I enjoy. 

So, AITA for not being more careful with my words and wanting to share my lifestyle choices with my sister?",465,1101,0.87,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_88416,2021-11-02 00:00:00,YTA,1318,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I need to get this off my chest and I really hope I’m not the asshole here. So, I’m a 28-year-old guy, and I live in an apartment with my roommate, Tyler. We’ve been friends for years, and everything has been fine until recently. 

Tyler is super into fitness and he’s been trying to get me to join him at the gym for a while now. I’m not really into working out, but I’ve gone a few times just to support him. The problem is, he’s been really pushy about it lately. He signed us up for a membership without even asking me and told me I should just “suck it up” and try to commit to a healthier lifestyle.

I was really annoyed by this. I mean, I didn’t want to go to the gym in the first place, and now I was stuck paying for a membership I didn’t want. After a couple of weeks of him constantly bugging me to go, I snapped one day. I told him that I didn’t appreciate his attitude and that he was being controlling over something that should be my choice. I said if he wanted to work out, that was great, but I didn’t want to be dragged into it.

Well, he got really upset and said that I was being selfish and that he was just trying to help me be healthier. I told him I didn’t need his help and that he should respect my decision. He then mentioned that I never supported him in his fitness journey and that it felt one-sided. 

I felt bad for a second, but I really don’t think I should have to work out just because he’s passionate about it. So, I told him I wasn’t going to change for him and that if he couldn’t handle that, maybe he should rethink our friendship. 

Now things are awkward between us, and I feel like I might have overreacted. I really don’t think I’m the asshole here, but maybe I could have handled it differently? What do you all think?

You're the Asshole,"I (27F) have a close group of friends that I hang out with regularly. For context, we've known each other for years, and we often celebrate milestones together. Recently, my friend Emma (26F) got engaged, and I was thrilled for her. However, once the initial excitement settled, I started to feel a bit envious. Emma's engagement was everything I had dreamed of, and I began to compare my life to hers, which was not a healthy mindset.

A couple of weeks after her engagement, Emma threw an engagement party and invited all of us. I was excited to celebrate but couldn’t shake the jealousy I felt. During the party, I made a few offhand comments that were meant to be jokes but ended up sounding really bitter. For example, when she was showing off her ring, I jokingly said, “Oh, that’s cute! Looks like you finally trapped someone!” and “I guess it’s really true that some people just get lucky in love, huh?” 

At first, people laughed, but I could see Emma's smile falter. After a while, she pulled me aside and told me that my comments were hurtful and that she felt I was undermining her happiness. I laughed it off and said she was being too sensitive, but inside, I felt a little guilty.

When I got home, I realized that my jealousy had clearly affected how I treated my friend, and I felt terrible. Yet, I was still too proud to reach out and apologize right away. Instead, I talked to some mutual friends about the situation, and while some agreed that my jokes were in poor taste, others thought Emma was overreacting.

Now I’m left wondering if I really crossed a line. I’ve been feeling torn about whether I should apologize or if Emma should just toughen up. So, AITA for making those comments at Emma’s engagement party?",44,2140,0.84,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_79743,2021-07-29 00:00:00,YTA,1736,AITA
You're the Asshole,"Hello everyone, I need some advice, but I have a feeling I might be the problem here.

So, a few weeks ago, I was invited to a friend's wedding. It was a small, intimate ceremony, and I was really looking forward to it. However, I was also going through a bit of a rough patch financially and was struggling to make ends meet. 

A couple of days before the wedding, I realized I didn't have anything nice to wear. I decided to borrow a dress from my sister, who has a great sense of style. I told her about the wedding, and she was more than happy to lend me one of her dresses. It was beautiful, and I felt really confident in it.

The day of the wedding came, and everything was going smoothly until it was time for the reception. As I was mingling, I noticed another guest wearing the exact same dress as I was! I was shocked and immediately started to feel self-conscious. To make matters worse, I overheard some people commenting on how the dress looked better on her than on me. 

In a moment of insecurity, I approached her and told her that I thought it was unfair that she chose to wear the same dress. I even suggested that she should change since I had borrowed it from my sister. I thought I was just being honest, but she looked taken aback and told me she had no idea I was wearing it and that it was a popular style. 

After that awkward interaction, I felt guilty and embarrassed, but I still couldn't shake the feeling that it was inconsiderate of her to wear it. I later found out that she was a close friend of the bride, and she had been invited to the wedding too, which made me feel even worse for causing a scene. 

Now, I'm reflecting on my actions and wondering if I went too far. My friends have said I was just being honest, but I feel like I might have overreacted and put a damper on the event.

Recently, I decided to host a small gathering for my friends, just a few of us hanging out and having some drinks. I sent out the invites a week in advance, and everyone was excited to come over.

On the day of the gathering, I was being a bit loud with music and laughter. I noticed that my neighbor's kids were getting restless and started to cry. After a while, I received a text from her asking if I could keep the noise down since her kids were trying to sleep. I was a bit annoyed because I felt like it was a Saturday night and I should be able to enjoy my time without feeling guilty.

I replied to her text saying that she should have made sure her kids were asleep before I started my gathering and that it was just one night. I also told her that if the noise bothered her that much, she could always take her kids out for a drive or something.

I ended up keeping the music at a lower volume, but I still let my friends stay until late. In the morning, I felt bad for how I handled the situation, but I also think she was overreacting.

A few weeks ago, we decided to invite a new friend, Alex (25M), to join our game. Alex is a cool guy, but he’s a bit of a know-it-all when it comes to D&D. During one of our sessions, I made a joke about how the party should stop listening to him because he’s just a wannabe wizard who can’t even cast the basic spells right. Everyone chuckled, but then Alex got really defensive and told me that I shouldn’t belittle him just because I’m more experienced.

I brushed it off, thinking he was just being overly sensitive. So, later that evening, when we were all hanging out, I kept making jokes at his expense, saying things like, “Maybe if you read the rulebook instead of just pretending to know everything, we wouldn’t have to keep correcting you.” My friends laughed, but I could see that Alex was getting more and more uncomfortable. At one point, he even asked me to stop, but I thought it was just part of the fun and kept going.

Eventually, he got up and left, saying he didn’t want to hang out with someone who put others down to feel better about themselves. My friends awkwardly said their goodbyes and I was left feeling confused. I thought I was just being funny and that everyone was in on the joke.

Afterward, I realized that maybe I had crossed a line. While I didn’t mean any harm, I definitely could have seen how my comments were hurtful, especially since Alex had just joined our group and was still trying to find his footing. I’ve been reflecting on it and I’m starting to think that I might have been a jerk about it. 

Now I’m wondering if I should reach out to Alex and apologize for my behavior. I didn’t think I was being that bad at the time, but I can see how it might have come off as bullying.

My sister is pregnant and due in April. She’s been planning a baby shower for herself and has been excited about it for months. She’s put a lot of effort into the details, including a beautiful venue and a big guest list. I think it’s great that she’s planning something special, but here’s where the issue arises: she’s decided to schedule it on the same day as my long-planned annual friends’ reunion.

Now, I’ve been organizing this reunion for years. It’s a big deal for my friends and me, and we all look forward to it every year. It’s not just a casual get-together; it's a tradition, and I’ve already booked the venue, sent out invitations, and made all the arrangements.

When I told my sister I wouldn’t be able to make it to her baby shower because of the reunion, she was upset. She accused me of prioritizing my friends over family and said I was being selfish. I tried to explain how important this reunion is to me, but she just kept insisting that family should come first, especially when it involves a new baby.

In the heat of the moment, I said some things I regret. I told her she was being unreasonable for expecting me to cancel something that I’ve put so much effort into for her event. Now, she’s hurt, and our parents are caught in the middle, trying to mediate. They think I should just skip the reunion for my sister’s sake, which makes me feel even worse.

You're the Asshole,"So, a few weeks ago, my friend was celebrating her engagement, and she decided to throw a small party at her house. She asked everyone to contribute $20 to help cover the food and drinks. I thought it was a bit tacky to ask for money for your own celebration, but I went along with it because she's my friend and I didn't want to seem rude.

When I got to the party, I noticed that some of my other friends had brought gifts for her, like nice bottles of wine and personalized items. I felt a bit embarrassed because I only brought the $20. During the party, I kept hearing my friend talk about how grateful she was for the thoughtful gifts, and I started to feel increasingly uncomfortable about my contribution.

As the night went on, I got a bit tipsy and decided to confront her about it. I told her that I thought it was pretty selfish to ask for money when people were already bringing gifts. I also said that I felt like my contribution didn't matter compared to the gifts everyone else brought. It turned awkward really fast, and other guests started to get involved, defending her and saying that it was her party and she could ask for whatever she wanted.

After that, I ended up leaving in a huff, feeling justified in my anger. I didn’t really care about how I made her feel or how my comments affected the party; I was more focused on my own discomfort. Later that night, I posted a rant about how ungrateful people can be when they throw a party and expect others to cater to them.

After a couple of weeks of sleepless nights, I decided I had enough.

Matt didn’t laugh and just kind of stared at me, and after a moment, he said, “That’s not funny.” I tried to brush it off, thinking it was just my delivery that fell flat, but Jess gave me a stern look and said I needed to apologize.

This is a long one, so bear with me. 

I (38F) have a 12-year-old daughter, Emily. When I was pregnant, I was in a difficult situation with my then-boyfriend, who ended up being distant throughout the pregnancy and after Emily was born. I raised her mainly on my own, but we ended up in a good place after he left. I’ve always tried to be a supportive and loving parent, and I believe I’ve done a good job even if it hasn’t always been easy.

A few weeks ago, Emily went to a birthday party, and the theme was superheroes. She came back excited and told me how much fun she had. She mentioned that her friends all dressed up as their favorite characters, and she really liked the Flash. I thought that was great; she’s finding her interests!

However, a couple of days later, Emily casually mentioned that one of the kids made a joke about how she was “the Flash’s mom” in a funny way, implying that she was always ‘late’ or ‘missing’ when they needed her. She laughed it off, but I immediately felt defensive. I’ve always been there for her, and the idea of her friends thinking I’m a bad mom really stung.

So, in a fit of anger, I confiscated her new Flash costume, telling her that if her friends were going to make fun of her, she wouldn’t be wearing it. I thought I was teaching her a lesson about how people perceive her and making sure she doesn’t get hurt by their jokes. Instead of encouraging her to embrace her interests, I shut her down.

Emily was heartbroken. She spent days without the costume, feeling embarrassed and upset. When I finally talked to her about it, she expressed that she felt I was overreacting and that she just wanted to have fun with her friends. I brushed off her feelings and told her that she’d understand when she’s older.

Now, I’m starting to realize that my reaction may have been too harsh. I thought I was protecting her, but it seems I might have been the one being unreasonable. I’m considering giving her the costume back as a way to apologize, but I’m unsure if that would make me the asshole for not standing my ground.

You're the Asshole,"I (19F) just started college a few weeks ago, and I’ve been excited to meet new people and make friends. I grew up in a small town where I felt very out of place, and I’ve always dreamed of starting fresh in a bigger city.

Recently, I went out with a group of classmates, and we were all getting to know each other. As the night went on, the topic of dating came up. One girl, who seemed really sweet, mentioned she was interested in someone from our class. I jokingly said, “I wouldn’t date anyone from this school.

The mood in the group shifted, and I noticed a few people looked uncomfortable. One guy spoke up and said, “That’s kind of harsh, don’t you think? We’re all trying to make friends here.” I brushed it off, thinking it was just a joke gone wrong, and I kept laughing and talking.

Later, I overheard a couple of people saying they thought I had a superiority complex and that I sounded like a snob. I honestly didn’t mean to offend anyone; I just wanted to express how excited I was to leave my hometown behind.

You're the Asshole,"I (30M) have a younger sister, Emily (24F), who has always been somewhat sensitive and emotional. Growing up, I often found myself teasing her, which I thought was harmless sibling fun. However, she has a tendency to take things personally, and I never really considered her feelings deeply enough.

Recently, Emily graduated from college, and I wanted to celebrate her achievement. I planned a small gathering with friends and family, and I thought it would be a good idea to roast her a little, like we always joke around. During my speech, I made a few comments about her clumsiness and some of her past awkward moments in school. I thought everyone would find it funny, but I quickly noticed that Emily's smile faded, and she looked visibly upset.

After the gathering, she confronted me, saying that my jokes were hurtful and that I should have known better than to bring up some of her insecurities in front of everyone. I brushed it off and told her it was all in good fun and that she was being too sensitive. I didn't think it was a big deal since everyone else was laughing.

A few days later, Emily told me she didn't want to talk to me for a while because she felt like I didn't respect her feelings. I was frustrated because I felt like I was just being a fun brother, and I couldn’t understand why she was making such a big deal out of it.

So, am I the asshole for teasing my sister at her graduation celebration and not understanding why it hurt her?",88,1993,0.59,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_12681,2022-01-17 00:00:00,YTA,1466,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I recently hosted a small dinner party at my house for some close friends. I wanted to make it special, so I decided to cook a three-course meal. I spent the entire day preparing everything and was really excited to show off my culinary skills.

When my friends arrived, I noticed that one of my friends, Sarah, seemed a bit off. She’s been on a strict diet for health reasons, and I thought it would be fine since I had made a salad as a starter. However, I had also prepared a rich pasta dish and a decadent chocolate dessert, which I knew she wouldn't be able to eat.

As dinner progressed, I couldn’t help but bring up how much I enjoyed cooking and how I had spent all day working on the meal. I casually mentioned how I thought the pasta was my best dish yet, and I could see Sarah's discomfort growing. Instead of being considerate, I poked fun at her diet by asking if she was really going to miss out on my amazing cooking just because of some health restrictions. I laughed it off, but I could tell she was really not amused.

When it came time for dessert, I served the chocolate cake and again made a comment about how everyone should indulge a little. I looked at Sarah and said, ""Come on, it’s just one slice! You can always work it off later!"" My other friends laughed, but I could see that Sarah was visibly upset.

After the dinner, Sarah told me she felt excluded and hurt by my comments. She felt that I should have been more understanding of her situation instead of making jokes at her expense. I brushed it off, thinking I was just trying to lighten the mood. I even told her she was being too sensitive and that it was just a joke.

You're the Asshole,"I recently got into a heated argument with my brother over a family vacation we’re planning. We’ve been taking a big family trip every summer, and this year, my brother suggested we go to a resort that’s a bit pricey. I didn’t think it was fair that we were considering such an expensive place, especially since my brother’s been doing really well financially while I’ve been struggling to make ends meet.

When I expressed my concerns about the cost, my brother got defensive. He said that we should be able to enjoy some nice things as a family and that he would cover the costs for anyone who couldn’t afford it. I felt embarrassed and called him out for being condescending, suggesting that he was trying to show off his wealth. I told him that he should be more sensitive to the fact that not everyone is in the same financial situation.

Things escalated and I ended up saying that if he’s so keen on this resort, he can pay for everyone to go himself. I realize now that I might have come off as ungrateful and harsh, especially since he was trying to include everyone in the fun. I didn’t mean to hurt his feelings, but I felt like he wasn’t considering my situation at all.

You're the Asshole,"My best friend, Sarah, has been struggling with her mental health for the past couple of years. She’s been open about her anxiety and depression, and I’ve tried to be there for her as much as I can. However, I've also been going through a tough time myself—my job has been incredibly stressful, and I've been feeling overwhelmed.

Recently, Sarah asked me to help plan her birthday party. She wanted it to be a big celebration with all her friends, and although I was flattered she asked me, I really didn’t have the energy or the time to commit to it. I initially agreed but as the date approached, I found myself feeling more and more drained. I suggested a smaller gathering instead, maybe just dinner with our closest friends, but she insisted on a big party, saying it was important to her.

Feeling the pressure, I ended up snapping at her one day when she asked for my help again. I told her that I was tired of feeling like her emotional support robot and that I had my own problems to deal with. I could tell I hurt her feelings, but I felt like my own struggles were being overshadowed. I ended up just saying, “I can’t keep putting your needs before mine,” and told her she should probably plan the party herself.

In the end, she ended up having a small get-together without me because she felt I wasn’t supportive enough. I did apologize, but I still feel frustrated. I was overwhelmed and didn’t think it was fair for her to expect me to do all the planning when I was struggling too.

I have a group of friends I go out with regularly, and we often hit up restaurants together. Since I have a steady income now, I've decided that I would cover the bill whenever we go out.

At first, my friends appreciated it, and I felt good about treating them. However, it’s become a bit of a habit now. I always pick up the tab, and when it comes time to settle up, I just tell them it’s on me. My friends have started to expect it, and I can see that they hardly even reach for their wallets anymore.

Last time we went out, the bill came to $150, and I just paid it without thinking twice. When I suggested we split it, they all looked at me in disbelief and said they thought I liked treating them. I was a bit hurt, and I said something along the lines of, ""Well, you could at least offer to chip in!"" 

One of my friends mentioned that it felt nice to go out without worrying about the cost, and I guess I took it the wrong way. I got defensive and said something snarky like, ""Maybe you all should just get used to my generosity then.""

Looking back, I know I’ve been a bit pushy with my generosity and probably made them feel uncomfortable. I shouldn’t have snapped at them for enjoying the situation I created.

In a light-hearted attempt to lift the mood, I started making jokes about relationships and how dating is a disaster, thinking that it would help lighten the atmosphere.

I started making snarky comments about how I thought it was unfair that she was leaving while I’m stuck in a dead-end job. I guess I must have gone a bit too far because I suggested that she should reconsider moving if it meant abandoning our friendship.

Sarah looked hurt and told me that she didn’t expect me to react that way and that she thought I would be more supportive since she was really excited about this opportunity. Instead of apologizing, I doubled down, saying that if she really cared about our friendship, she would think twice about taking the job. 

We ended up arguing, and she left feeling really upset. I think I was just feeling insecure about my own situation, but I can’t help but feel that I was justified in expressing my feelings. Later, she texted me saying she needed some space, which made me feel even more frustrated.

I didn’t think much of it, as he tends to do this.

Later that day, I saw on social media that Jake had posted pictures of himself at a concert, looking perfectly fine and enjoying himself. I felt betrayed and annoyed, as I had to scramble to cover his shift last minute. The next day, I confronted him about it when he came in to work.

I told him that I was disappointed he lied about being sick and that he needed to take his job more seriously. Jake tried to explain that he had been feeling ill earlier in the day but decided to go to the concert because he felt better. I didn’t buy it. I told him that if he was going to keep calling in sick while doing things like going to concerts, he might need to reconsider his position here.

To make my point, I decided to give him a written warning for his attendance record, stating that if this continued, he could face further disciplinary action.

Instead of apologizing and offering to return the suit, I insisted that I loved it and that it was my style. I told him he should be happy that I wanted to look my best for his big day. Dave then went on to tell me that he felt I was being selfish and that I should have considered the overall look instead of just what I wanted. He suggested that I wear the original suit I had, which was still in decent shape.

I ended up ignoring his advice and wore the new suit to the wedding anyway. During the ceremony, I could see Dave was visibly annoyed, and it kind of put a damper on the day for him. Afterward, he expressed how hurt he was that I didn’t care about his vision or feelings.

When my friend saw me grabbing more, she politely asked if I could leave some for others. I rolled my eyes and told her to lighten up, that it was just some random stuff that no one would miss. I felt justified in my actions since I was a close friend of the birthday girl.

So a bit of background: I've been best friends with “Linda” for over a decade. We’ve been through a lot together, and I always thought we were really close. Recently, she got engaged, and I was thrilled for her. However, things took a turn when she started planning her wedding.

Linda has been going all out with the preparations. She posts about it on social media constantly, sharing her dress fittings and venue tours. However, I noticed something that bothered me: she hasn’t mentioned me once in any of her wedding plans. I assumed I would be a part of her special day, maybe even a bridesmaid, or at least involved in some capacity. 

A couple of weeks ago, I decided to bring it up with her. I asked if she had thought about who she wanted in the bridal party and if I would be included. Linda looked surprised and said she hadn’t even considered having a bridal party at all, but then she quickly mentioned how she was close with some other friends from college and was thinking of including them in her plans.

I felt hurt and even a bit betrayed. I thought we were closer than that, and I told her how I felt. I said, “I’ve always been there for you, and it’s kind of painful to see you planning this incredible day without even considering me.” 

Linda seemed taken aback and told me I was being dramatic and that it was her wedding, and she could do what she wanted. I felt really upset and ended up saying, “Well, it’s just disappointing to know that I don’t mean as much to you as you mean to me.” 

After that conversation, things have been a bit awkward between us. She hasn’t really reached out, and I’ve been second-guessing if I overreacted. I realize that it’s her special day, and she can choose whoever she wants, but I can’t help but feel like I’ve been sidelined.

However, I find it really frustrating when it comes to her chores and responsibilities around the house.

For example, I’ve noticed that she often leaves her dirty dishes in her room or forgets to take out the trash, despite reminders. I believe that at her age, she should be able to handle these simple tasks. I've talked to my wife about it, and she thinks I’m being too hard on her.

I came home from work and saw that she had once again left a mess in the kitchen. I lost my temper and grounded her for a week, taking away her phone and computer privileges. I told her that if she couldn’t handle her responsibilities, then she didn’t deserve the privileges that come with them.

Instead of just enjoying my slice of cake, I thought it would be funny to make a comment to my friends about how the banquet staff must be slacking and suggested that we should ""demand"" a refund for our meals since we had to wait so long.

To my surprise, my joking remark caught the attention of a few people at nearby tables, and they started laughing. Feeling emboldened, I turned to the couple who had been complaining and said, ""Maybe if you just left the cake for the rest of us, you wouldn’t be so hungry!"" I thought it was all in good fun, but the couple looked visibly upset, and the atmosphere shifted.

After realizing that my comment had crossed a line, I tried to backtrack by saying I was only joking, but I could tell that my humor didn't help. Instead, it seemed to make things worse, and I ended up feeling awkward for the rest of the evening.

Now I’m reflecting on whether my comment was just a harmless joke or if I was out of line. I honestly thought I was just having fun, but I can see how it might have come across as rude, especially at a wedding where everyone is supposed to be celebrating. 

So, Reddit, AITA for making a joke at the wedding that upset some guests? 

Edit to accept Judgement

The people of reddit have spoken. IATA. 

Thanks for weighing in everyone. After thinking it over, I realize my comment was inappropriate and it was not the time or place for jokes, especially at such an important event.

You're the Asshole,"So, I (24F) have a friend named Jenna (25F) who is really into fitness and healthy eating. I get that everyone has their own lifestyle choices, but Jenna takes it to a whole new level. She posts about her workouts and meal preps on social media constantly, and she's always trying to convince me to join her on these extreme diets or intense workout regimes.

I’ve always been more of a casual gym-goer and I enjoy my food, including my junk food. Whenever I mention my favorite snacks or meals, Jenna gives me this judgmental look and starts offering unsolicited advice on how I should change my diet. At first, I tried to brush it off, but it began to get really annoying. 

The last straw was when we went out to dinner with a group of friends, and I ordered a burger and fries. Jenna loudly exclaimed, “I can’t believe you’re eating that! It’s so unhealthy!” She then proceeded to explain how I could “make better choices” and pulled out her phone to show the group a picture of her latest kale smoothie. I felt humiliated and just wanted to enjoy my meal in peace. 

After that, I started venting to our mutual friends about how controlling and obnoxious she was. I didn't hold back; I told them I couldn't stand her constant fitness lectures and how I felt like I couldn't be myself around her. A couple of them agreed with me, but I think I may have gone too far.

Now, Jenna's been left out of some social gatherings because people don’t want to deal with her attitude, and I’m starting to feel guilty about it. I’m realizing that maybe I shouldn’t have influenced others’ opinions about her just because I find her annoying. 

So, AITA for talking badly about Jenna and contributing to her social isolation?",980,2958,0.56,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_27297,2018-07-24 00:00:00,YTA,1716,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I (28M) have a younger sister (23F) who just graduated from college. She's been trying to find a job in her field, and while she’s been having a tough time, I’ve been supportive. I even let her stay at my apartment for free while she’s job hunting. 

Recently, she had an interview for a position she was really excited about. On the day of the interview, I offered to help her prepare. I spent a couple of hours going over potential questions and helping her practice her responses. I wanted her to feel confident and ready.

After her interview, she came home visibly upset. She told me that she felt like she bombed it and started to cry. I tried to comfort her, but I couldn’t help but express my frustration. I said something along the lines of, ""Maybe if you had taken it more seriously and practiced a bit harder, you wouldn’t feel this way."" 

In hindsight, I realize that was a pretty harsh thing to say. I was just trying to encourage her to push herself more, but it came out as me being critical. Instead of supporting her in that moment, I made her feel worse, and I could see the hurt in her eyes. She ended up leaving the room to be alone, and I felt terrible afterward.

I later tried to apologize, but she didn’t seem ready to talk. I’ve tried to be supportive since then, but I can’t shake the feeling that I was a complete jerk for not being more understanding and compassionate when she needed it the most.

You're the Asshole,"Last weekend, I went to a friend's birthday party at a restaurant. There were several people I didn't know, but I was excited to meet new faces. During the party, I started talking to a girl named Sarah. She was friendly and we had a lot in common; we both loved hiking and traveling. I found her really attractive, and we ended up talking for a couple of hours.

As the night went on, I noticed she was a bit heavier than what I usually go for. I had been trying to stay open-minded, but I found myself thinking about how I would feel about being seen with her in public. I didn't want to be shallow, but I couldn't help it. After we exchanged numbers, I texted her the next day to say I had a great time. 

However, when she asked me out for coffee later in the week, I hesitated. I decided to be honest and told her that I just didn’t think it would work out because I was looking for someone more fit and active. I thought I was being straightforward, but she seemed really hurt and said that my response was pretty shallow. 

I discussed it with my friends later, and they told me I was justified in wanting to date someone who fits my physical preferences. However, I can't shake the feeling that maybe I was too harsh and could have approached it differently.

You're the Asshole,"So, I need to share something that happened recently with my coworker, Jason. We work in the same office and have been friendly, but I wouldn’t say we’re close friends. Jason has been going through a tough time; his father is really sick, and he’s been taking care of him a lot. I respect what he’s doing, but honestly, it feels like he’s making every conversation we have revolve around his situation. 

One day, during a break, he started sharing a long, emotional story about how hard it’s been for him. I sat there, listening, but after a while, I just got tired of it. I interrupted him and said, “You know, there are people who have it much worse than you. You should just be grateful you still have your dad around, even if he’s sick.” I thought I was being realistic, and maybe even a little tough love.

He looked taken aback and said I was being insensitive. I laughed it off and told him not to be so dramatic, saying it’s just life and everyone deals with problems. He ended up walking away, visibly upset. 

Later, I found out that a few of our colleagues heard what I said, and they were all shocked. They told me I was out of line and didn’t consider how difficult things must be for him. I still think I was just telling him to toughen up, but now I’m starting to wonder if I really crossed a line.

You're the Asshole,"Last month, I attended a friend's wedding, which was a big deal for everyone involved. I was really excited and wanted to make the most of it. The reception was beautiful, and there was an open bar. I decided it would be a great opportunity to let loose since I don’t go to weddings often.

As the night went on, I started drinking more than I should have. I thought I was being charming and funny, but in reality, I was being loud and obnoxious. I kept interrupting the newlyweds during their speeches, making jokes that fell flat, and I even spilled a drink on the groom's suit while trying to dance with him. I didn't think it was a big deal at the time, but I could see that people were uncomfortable.

At one point, I got up to sing a karaoke song that nobody asked for and completely butchered it. Instead of laughing along, I could see people cringing. After that, my friends decided it was time to take me home because I was making a fool of myself. I was so caught up in the moment that I didn’t realize how much I had embarrassed myself and my friends.

Looking back, I genuinely feel bad for ruining parts of the wedding and being such a distraction. I reached out to the couple to apologize, but I haven’t heard back. I also noticed that my friends have been acting differently since the wedding, and I’m worried they might be upset with me too.

You're the Asshole,"My sister Lily is getting married in a few months, and she asked me to be her maid of honor. I was thrilled and immediately started planning her bridal shower and bachelorette party. Lily has always been my best friend, and I wanted to make these events special for her. 

Lily is in her late 20s and has been dating her fiancé, Mark, for about two years. Mark is a great guy, but I have to admit, I've never really liked him. He can be a bit controlling, and I feel like he doesn’t treat her as well as she deserves. Despite that, I wanted to put my feelings aside and support her on her big day.

As we were planning the bridal shower, I decided to take charge and organize everything. I figured it was my job as the maid of honor. I invited all of Lily’s friends, including some of my own, and I made sure to choose a venue that I thought would impress everyone. However, the venue was quite expensive, and I didn't consult Lily about it beforehand. I just assumed she'd be okay with it since I was planning everything.

When I finally told her about the venue, she was shocked. She mentioned that we could have done something more low-key and budget-friendly, considering a lot of her friends were still in school and struggling financially. I brushed her off, saying that it was her special day, and she should want to celebrate it properly. I also suggested that if anyone couldn’t afford to come, they could just skip it.

Lily looked upset, but I didn’t think much of it. I went ahead and booked the venue and started making arrangements. A week later, she called me in tears, saying that some of her friends felt excluded because of the high cost and that they might not be able to come. I felt frustrated because I thought I was doing everything right, and I told her that she should be more considerate of the effort I was putting in.

When I saw her again, I made a comment about how her friends needed to step it up if they wanted to celebrate her properly. Lily finally exploded, saying I was being selfish and inconsiderate. She said it was her day, and I should have included her in the planning instead of just taking over. I got defensive and told her that I was just trying to make it special for her, and she should be grateful.

He seems really into her, and I always try to be supportive. However, I’ve noticed that Sam has changed a lot since he started dating her. He’s become more distant, cancels plans we had, and spends most of his free time with her. 

Last week, I found out through a mutual friend that Liz has a bit of a reputation in our social circle. Apparently, she’s cheated on her last three boyfriends and has a history of being manipulative. I didn’t want to just let this slide because I genuinely care about Sam and don’t want him to get hurt.

So, I decided to take matters into my own hands. Instead of talking to Sam directly, I reached out to him via text and told him that I had some ""concerns"" about Liz. I mentioned the rumors I had heard, but I wasn't upfront about where I got the information. I made my message sound kind of casual, but it was clear I was trying to warn him.

Sam was really upset when he got my message. He thought I was trying to sabotage his relationship, and he told me that he didn’t care about what I heard from other people. He said he trusts Liz and feels happy with her. The conversation ended with him saying he needed space from me.

Recently, one of my friends, Sarah, who is 29, went through a tough breakup. Her boyfriend of three years cheated on her, and as you can imagine, she was heartbroken.

To help her cope, I decided to throw her a small get-together at my house. I invited a few of our mutual friends, and we spent the night eating, drinking, and reminiscing about the good times. During the evening, Sarah mentioned that she was thinking about getting back into dating, which I supported. However, I couldn’t resist sharing my opinion on the matter. 

I told her that she should take her time to heal and not rush into anything. I then jokingly said that maybe she should join a dating app but only if she was ready to handle the “horrors” of the dating scene. Sarah laughed but seemed a little uncomfortable. I didn’t think too much of it at the time.

A few days later, Sarah texted me, telling me that she had signed up for a dating app. I was surprised but told her that I was happy for her. However, later that week, she posted a picture with a new guy she had been seeing. I don’t know what came over me, but I impulsively commented on her post saying, “Wow, that was fast! Are you sure you’re over your ex?” 

Immediately after I sent it, I regretted my words. Sarah responded with a short “Thanks for your support” and didn’t reply to my following messages. I later found out that I had hurt her feelings and made her feel judged, which was the last thing I wanted. Our mutual friends told me that it wasn't my place to comment on her dating life, especially so soon after her breakup.

She was furious. She called me and asked why I didn’t even mention it to her. I tried to explain that I thought it would be a fun trip and that I didn’t want to add to her stress before the wedding, but she was still really upset. 

She felt disrespected that I didn’t prioritize her and the wedding over a concert, especially since she’s been putting in so much effort.

When we got to Sarah's place, she had made a big batch of popcorn for everyone. I immediately felt my stomach turn. Instead of quietly dealing with it, I made a scene about it. I loudly complained that I couldn't enjoy the evening with that horrible smell in the air and insisted that she should know better than to make it in a closed space with me around.

My friends were taken aback, and Sarah looked hurt. She said she just wanted to create a fun atmosphere for everyone, and she thought we all liked popcorn. I ended up insisting that she throw it out, which she reluctantly did after some awkward back and forth. 

Looking back, I realize I could have just sucked it up or stepped outside for a bit instead of making a fuss. But I felt so strongly about it that I didn't think twice. Now, I'm wondering if I was too harsh and if I ruined everyone's fun. AITA?",865,1179,0.71,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_28517,2018-12-23 00:00:00,YTA,1458,AITA
You're the Asshole,"A few days ago, I had a family gathering at my cousin's house. It was a big event because we hadn't seen each other in a while, and everyone was excited to catch up. My cousin, who is quite an amazing cook, prepared a huge meal for everyone, and I was really looking forward to it.

As the evening went on, I noticed that my cousin had spent a lot of time preparing a special dish that was vegetarian because one of our other cousins, who I’ll call Sarah, is a strict vegetarian. I’m not vegetarian myself, and I tend to forget that some people have different dietary restrictions. I saw the delicious food and, honestly, I just couldn't help myself. 

When the food was served, I took a generous portion of everything, completely ignoring the vegetarian dish. As I sat down to eat, I noticed Sarah eyeing the dish with disappointment because it was nearly gone. Without thinking, I loudly joked, “Wow, this vegetarian dish is really good! Guess I should have left some for you, huh?” Sarah looked visibly upset, and I honestly thought she was overreacting.

After dinner, when everyone was done eating, Sarah pulled me aside and told me that it was really inconsiderate of me to take most of the vegetarian dish, especially since it was made for her. I shrugged it off and said she should have spoken up if she wanted more. I felt like it was her responsibility to manage her own food, not mine. 

Later, my aunt overheard our conversation and came to my defense, saying that Sarah should be more assertive about her needs. I felt justified at the time because it seemed like everyone else was on my side, but now I’m starting to wonder if I was being a bit of a jerk. I didn’t mean to hurt Sarah’s feelings, and I definitely didn’t mean to be inconsiderate.

You're the Asshole,"So, my friend and I went to a local café that’s known for its amazing pastries. I’ve been looking forward to trying their famous chocolate croissant. We both ordered our drinks and pastries and found a nice table outside.

While we were enjoying our treats, I noticed a family sitting at the next table with a little girl who was being a bit noisy but mostly just excited about her dessert. My friend made a comment about how the parents should “control their kid” and I found myself agreeing with him. I turned around and said something like, “Yeah, some people just don’t know how to manage their kids in public.” I laughed a bit, thinking it was all in good fun.

Well, the parents heard me and looked visibly hurt. The mom shot me a glare, and the dad looked uncomfortable. I thought I was just making a light-hearted comment, but my friend leaned in and told me that I might have gone too far. I brushed it off, thinking it was just a joke and that they needed to toughen up.

However, the atmosphere got tense, and I felt a bit awkward. When the family left, I could see the little girl looking sad. My friend told me that I should have kept my opinions to myself and that it wasn’t fair to criticize a child for being a child. I told him I was just speaking the truth and that if the parents couldn’t handle it, that was their problem.

Now, I’m starting to wonder if I was too harsh. Was I really an asshole for voicing my opinion about the family? Should I have just kept my mouth shut?",743,1257,0.86,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_56144,2023-10-08 00:00:00,YTA,1495,AITA
You're the Asshole,"Last month, my roommate (let's call her Sarah) and I had a big argument that I feel really conflicted about. We’ve been living together for about a year, and we generally get along well. However, Sarah is going through a tough time with her family and has been a bit more emotional lately.

Last week, I had planned a small get-together with a few friends to celebrate my birthday. I invited a couple of close friends and thought it would be a nice way to unwind. I told Sarah about the party days in advance and asked if she wanted to join. She said she wasn’t in the mood for socializing and would rather stay in her room.

When my friends arrived, Sarah came out and started complaining about the noise. I tried to keep the volume down, but my friends were just having fun. At one point, Sarah came into the living room and snapped at us to be quieter. I felt embarrassed in front of my friends and told her to just go back to her room if she didn't want to hang out. I thought I was being reasonable, given it was my birthday.

After my friends left, Sarah was really upset and confronted me about how I treated her. She said I was being inconsiderate of her feelings and that I should have canceled the party since she was struggling. I told her it was my birthday and I had every right to celebrate. I also mentioned that I had warned her in advance about the party, so she had the option to prepare herself or join us.

Looking back, I realize that maybe I could have been more sensitive to her feelings, especially since she’s having a hard time. But I also feel like I shouldn’t have to put my life on hold for someone else’s struggles. Now Sarah is still upset with me, and I feel like I might have crossed a line.

Lily is really sweet and they seem happy together, but I can't help but feel a little jealous. I’ve been single for a while and have been struggling with my self-esteem, so seeing them together all the time kind of gets under my skin.

Last week, Jason invited me to their anniversary dinner, and I decided to go just to be supportive, even though I was feeling a bit bitter. At the dinner, everything was going fine until they started talking about their plans for the future. They were talking about traveling together and buying a house, and I just couldn’t hold back my feelings anymore. I started making snide comments about how “nice” it must be to have a perfect relationship and how “realistic” those plans were. 

Lily looked hurt, and Jason tried to brush it off, but I could tell I had ruined the mood. I continued to make sarcastic remarks throughout the dinner, and at one point, Jason snapped at me to stop. Instead of apologizing, I doubled down and said that they were just living in a fairy tale and would realize that soon enough.

After the dinner, Jason called me and told me that I was being a terrible sister and that I was ruining his happiness. I told him that I was just being honest and that he should be able to take some criticism about his “perfect” life. He hung up on me, and I haven’t talked to either of them since.

A few days ago, I decided I couldn't take it anymore. I went into her room while she was at school and cleared out the entire collection—about 20 stuffed animals. I packed them up and put them in the attic, thinking I was helping her by creating a cleaner space. When she got home and saw what I had done, she was heartbroken. She loved those toys and had emotional attachments to many of them.

I tried to explain to her that I was just helping to keep her room tidy and that she didn’t need so many stuffed animals. She was upset and told me I was being mean and didn’t understand her feelings.

Last weekend, my friend had a small birthday party at her apartment. It was meant to be a cozy gathering with just a few close friends, and I was excited to celebrate with her. However, during the party, I noticed that one of our friends, who is usually the center of attention, wasn’t getting much of it. His name is Mark, and he can be pretty loud and boisterous, often taking over conversations. 

As the evening progressed, I felt like Mark wasn't engaging as much, so I thought it would be fun to spark a little competition to lighten the mood. I suggested we play a game where each person would take turns telling a funny story from their life. I didn’t mean any harm, but I decided to steer the focus towards myself. I started sharing a story that I thought was really funny, and I could tell I was getting everyone's attention.

However, I could see that Mark was getting visibly annoyed. He tried to jump in a couple of times to share his own stories, but I just kept talking over him, thinking I was making the party more entertaining. The more I spoke, the more I noticed Mark's frustration growing. At one point, he attempted to share a story about a recent trip, but I interrupted him again with another one of my anecdotes, and I could tell he was getting really upset.

Eventually, Mark just left the room, and when I realized he was gone, I felt a bit guilty but brushed it off as him just being sensitive. Later, my friend pulled me aside and told me I was being really inconsiderate and that I should have let Mark have the space to share. I got defensive and said I was just trying to make everyone laugh and have a good time, but now I’m starting to think maybe I went too far.

I didn't think it was a big deal at the time, but now I worry that I might have ruined the night for Mark and made him feel unimportant. I really didn’t intend to overshadow him or hurt his feelings.

We’ve been dating for almost a year, and things have been going well, but I’ve noticed some signs that she’s not quite ready to take that step yet. 

One day, while we were having dinner, I brought up the topic of moving in together. I was excited and thought it would be a natural progression for us. However, when I mentioned it, her face dropped, and she seemed really taken aback. I pressed her on it, asking what her thoughts were, and she hesitated, saying she wasn’t sure if she was ready to make such a big commitment.

Instead of backing off, I doubled down. I started listing all the reasons why it would be great for us to live together — we would save money on rent, we’d have more quality time together, and it would help us grow as a couple. I even mentioned that I felt like I was ready to take our relationship to the next level and that if she truly cared about us, she should support this decision.

She got visibly upset and said that I was pressuring her and making her feel trapped. I didn’t see it that way at all; I thought I was just being logical and practical. I told her she was overreacting and that I was just trying to talk about our future, not force her into anything. 

After that, she left my place in tears, saying that I didn’t understand her feelings and that I was being selfish. I felt confused because I was just trying to have an open discussion. Now, some of my friends are saying that I should have respected her feelings more and not pushed the issue.

We’ve been together for about a year, and our kids have gotten along pretty well during our time together. Sarah and I have talked about the future and the possibility of moving in together, but we haven't made any concrete plans yet.

Recently, Sarah suggested that when the time comes for us to blend our families, we should help the kids transition by having them share a room. The idea is for Emma and Jake to share a room, and I was completely against it. I told Sarah that I don’t think it’s a good idea to mix their spaces like that. Emma is used to her own room and having her space, and I feel like forcing this change would upset her.

During a conversation, Sarah mentioned that having Jake share a room with Emma would help them bond and feel more like a family. I shot that down, saying that Emma deserves her own space and that I don't want her to feel like she has to accommodate someone else in her own home. I also think it’s unfair for Jake, being younger, to be put in a situation where he has to share a room with someone who is older and might not want to play or interact all the time.

I told Sarah that when we move in together, I plan on sticking to the idea that Emma keeps her room and that we can figure out another setup for Jake. I suggested putting him in a different room, but Sarah is adamant about the idea of them sharing a room. I think she’s putting too much pressure on both kids to try to force a bond that might not happen overnight.

Now, Sarah is upset with me, saying that I’m not considering Jake’s feelings and the fact that he may need the comfort of having someone else with him at night. I feel like I’m trying to protect Emma and keep her comfortable, but I’m starting to wonder if I’m being unreasonable.

But Sarah got really upset and told me to stop changing her decorations and respect her choices. I thought she was overreacting, so I joked about her being a “control freak” and said she should just let me help her make it look nice.

Jake has always been a bit of a troublemaker. He has a history of skipping school, getting into fights, and generally being rebellious. After one incident where he got caught vandalizing school property, I grounded him for two months and took away his gaming console, which he seemed to care about more than anything else. Lily, on the other hand, has been the model child. She gets good grades, helps around the house, and has never been in serious trouble.

I filmed this as I went along, making sure to capture his reactions. When he came home and saw what I had done, he was devastated and yelled at me, calling me abusive and out of control. I told him that this was what happens when he can't respect rules and that I was doing this for his own good.

She brought up the dress again and said she thought it was only fair for me to return it since she was going to use it for some DIY projects related to her wedding. I was taken aback. I mean, I really liked that dress, and I didn't see the harm in keeping it since I had spent money on alterations. I told her I wasn't willing to give it back, and that it was just a dress.

You're the Asshole,"My sister is getting married soon, and she asked me to be a bridesmaid. While I love her and want her to be happy, I really don’t want to do it for a few reasons.

1. I’m not a fan of weddings in general. The idea of spending an entire day in a dress, smiling for pictures, and being part of all the wedding fuss gives me anxiety. I just find it all really overwhelming, and I’d rather be doing something else.

2. The wedding is going to be pretty expensive for me. I already have to buy a dress and pay for hair and makeup, and then there’s the cost of travel to the venue, which is out of town. I’ve told my sister about my financial situation, but she still insists I should just “make it work” because it’s her big day.

I’ve already told her I might not have time to help with any of the pre-wedding planning and events, which she seemed disappointed about.

4. My sister has a habit of overreacting when things don’t go her way. I’m worried that if I say no, she’ll be hurt and make a big deal about it to our family. I really don’t want to be the bad guy in this situation.

So, I told her that I don’t want to be a bridesmaid, and I suggested that she find someone else who would be excited about it. I feel bad because I know it’s her wedding, but I really don’t want to do it. Am I being selfish for prioritizing my own feelings and needs over my sister’s big day?",337,2043,0.9,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_94061,2020-04-26 00:00:00,YTA,1553,AITA
You're the Asshole,"When I was 17, my little cousin, who was 6 at the time, came over to spend the weekend with us. I had just gotten my driver's license and was feeling pretty cool about it. My parents were out for the evening, and I was tasked with watching my cousin while she played with her toys in the living room.

As she was playing, she accidentally knocked over a glass of juice onto one of my favorite video game consoles, which immediately stopped working. I was furious, and instead of being a responsible adult, I decided to take it out on her.

I yelled at her, saying, ""You just ruined my whole life! Now you’ll never be able to play video games again!"" She looked terrified and started to cry. I didn’t stop there; I told her that if she kept messing things up, I would tell her parents that she was a bad kid, and they would send her away to live somewhere else.

She was sobbing, and I could see she was genuinely scared. I eventually calmed down, but I didn’t apologize to her. When my parents got home, I told them what happened, and they were upset with me. They said I should have handled it better and comforted her instead of scaring her.

Looking back, I realize I was a total jerk for how I treated her, and I definitely should have shown more maturity and compassion. I was upset about my console, but that didn’t justify my behavior. So, AITA?",111,1337,0.55,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_81509,2019-01-31 00:00:00,YTA,1352,AITA

I invited about 15 of his classmates, but one kid, Jake, didn’t get an invitation. Jake has a reputation for being a bit of a troublemaker in school; he often disrupts the class and has been known to act out during playdates. I just didn’t want that kind of energy at my son's special day.

Jake's mom found out about the party through other parents and called me to express her disappointment. She told me that Jake was really looking forward to the party and felt left out. I felt a little guilty, but I stood my ground and said I didn't want to invite him because I wanted the party to be fun and drama-free.

The day of the party, Jake showed up uninvited with his mom. They stood at the entrance, and I felt really uncomfortable. I told them that I couldn’t let him in since he wasn’t invited. Jake started to cry, and I felt bad, but I told him that it was just my son's party and that I had to stick to the guest list. His mom ended up leaving with him, and I could hear him sobbing as they walked away.

A few parents later told me I was kind of a jerk for excluding him, especially since it was a kid's birthday party. I still don’t think I did anything wrong, but now I’m wondering if I was too harsh. AITA?",925,1500,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_86190,2021-05-30 00:00:00,YTA,1381,AITA

So, I recently bought a new set of headphones that I was really excited about. I've been using them daily for a couple of weeks now, and they're great for listening to music and blocking out noise. My younger brother, who is eight years old, has been asking me to let him try them out. I kept telling him no, mainly because I didn't want them to get damaged or dirty, and I didn't think he would be responsible with them.

Well, yesterday, I came home from work and found him wearing my headphones while playing a video game. I freaked out and immediately told him to take them off. He looked so sad and said he just wanted to see what they were like. I felt bad for him, but I insisted that he should have asked me first and that he needed to understand the value of taking care of things. Instead of just letting it go, I went on about how he doesn't respect my things and how he needs to learn, even though he was just being curious.

Then, I took the headphones from him and put them away, and I could tell he was crushed. My mom came in and told me I was being too harsh and that I should have just let him try them out for a few minutes. I disagreed and felt justified in my anger.

I invited about ten people, and everyone was really excited to help make it a memorable night. We decided to host it at my apartment since it was more convenient, and I spent a lot of time decorating and prepping food.

The day before the party, I was chatting with my girlfriend and she mentioned how bummed she was that a couple of her friends, Sarah and Jake, couldn’t make it to celebrate with us because they were out of town. I remember thinking how terrible it was that they would miss it. Well, the next day, I was busy setting everything up when I heard a knock on the door. To my shock, it was Sarah and Jake! They had driven back just for the party.

I was furious. I thought they were trying to take the spotlight away from me and my plans. I didn't say anything to them right away, but when my girlfriend came home and saw them, she was thrilled. I couldn’t hide my annoyance and ended up snapping at them, telling them they shouldn't have come because I wanted it to be a surprise just from me. Everyone else was having a good time, but I kept sulking and making passive-aggressive comments.

Later in the evening, my girlfriend confronted me about how I was acting, and I told her I was just upset that they didn’t respect my surprise. She tried to explain that they simply wanted to support her and celebrate her birthday. I felt justified in my anger, but I could tell my behavior was ruining the mood.

Last week, we went to our favorite burger joint. One of my friends, Sarah, has been working really hard at the gym and has recently lost a significant amount of weight. While we were eating, I made a joke about how I could still eat a double burger while she was munching on a salad. Everyone laughed, but I noticed Sarah got quiet. I shrugged it off and kept teasing her about how she was ""missing out"" on the good food.

Later, I ended up making a comment about how she should be careful not to revert to her old self if she keeps eating like that. I thought I was being funny, but Sarah looked visibly hurt. When we left the restaurant, she told me that my comments made her feel bad about her journey and how hard she’s worked. I brushed it off, saying I was just joking and that she should lighten up.

A few days later, I saw Sarah post on social media about feeling discouraged and upset, and I found out from another friend that she’s been struggling with body image issues. I felt a twinge of guilt but mostly thought she was overreacting. After all, friends tease each other, right?

You're the Asshole,"I've been with my girlfriend, Lisa, for about three years now. We have a great relationship, and we often talk about our future together. Recently, we started discussing getting a dog. Lisa has always wanted a pet, and I thought it would be a good way to add some joy to our lives.

However, I have some reservations. I grew up in a household where pets were treated more like accessories than family members. My parents never really cared for our dogs properly; they were often left alone for long hours, and I remember them being unhappy. Because of this, I’ve developed a strong belief that having a pet is a huge responsibility that I’m not sure I want to take on.

When I brought up my concerns about getting a dog, Lisa was very enthusiastic and tried to reassure me that we could manage it together. She talked about all the responsibilities and how we could create a loving environment. But I couldn't shake the feeling that we might end up neglecting the dog, given my past experiences. 

So, I told her that I don’t think we should get a dog at all. I explained my reasons and insisted that it wouldn’t be fair to the animal if we weren’t fully committed to giving it all the love and attention it deserves. Lisa was really upset and felt like I was shutting down something she was really excited about. She said that she felt like I was being unfair by dismissing her feelings and shutting down the idea completely. 

In hindsight, I realize that I could have been more open to the idea and worked with her to find a compromise, perhaps looking into pet ownership more thoroughly together. But I was so focused on my own fears and experiences that I didn’t consider her perspective.

My sister, who has always been a bit of a drama queen, was upset that she wasn’t included in the wedding party. I explained to her that we wanted to keep it small, and that I simply couldn’t include everyone. She accepted it, but I could tell she was hurt.

A few weeks before the wedding, my sister started posting on social media about how she was ‘heartbroken’ and ‘betrayed’ for not being part of my special day.

I (28F) have a best friend, Claire (29F), who I've known since high school. We are very close and have always supported each other through thick and thin. Over the years, I've always been there for her, especially during tough times. I helped her through breakups, career changes, and even family issues. Claire has always been pretty straightforward about her finances; she’s done well in her career and has a solid job.

Recently, Claire got engaged to her boyfriend, who also has a good job. They are planning a wedding and have set a date for next year. I'm genuinely happy for her, but here’s the issue: I’ve been struggling financially for the last couple of years. I lost my job during the pandemic, and even though I’ve found a new one, I'm still trying to get back on my feet. Money is tight, and I’ve felt a lot of pressure to keep up with my expenses.

Now, Claire has started planning her wedding and has been sharing every detail with me. She’s excitedly talking about her dream venue, designer dress, and the lavish honeymoon they’re planning. She even mentioned how she would love for me to be a bridesmaid. At first, I was thrilled, but then she mentioned that bridesmaids typically pay for their own dresses and sometimes even help with other costs.

I’m already worried about how I would afford a dress, let alone any additional costs that come with being part of the bridal party.

I (35M) have been married to my wife (34F) for about 7 years. We have two beautiful kids, a 5-year-old daughter and a 3-year-old son. Life has been hectic but rewarding, and we’ve enjoyed our little family unit. Recently, however, my wife brought up the idea of having a third child. 

At first, I thought she was joking. I mean, we already have our hands full! But she was serious and kept bringing it up. I initially brushed it off, saying we were already busy and that we should focus on the kids we have. But she kept pushing the idea, saying she just felt like our family wasn’t complete yet. 

After a few weeks of this, I finally gave in and agreed to at least discuss it further. We sat down and talked about it, and I reiterated my concerns about the time, money, and energy it would take to have another baby. But she insisted that her maternal instincts were calling her to have another child. I felt pressured, so I reluctantly agreed to look into it.

To make her happy, I even went to a fertility doctor with her. The doctor explained the risks and challenges of having a baby at our age, but my wife was undeterred. She seemed to get more excited about the possibility of expanding our family, while I felt more and more overwhelmed.

One day, I was at work, and I overheard a couple of my coworkers talking about adoption. I realized that might be an alternative to having another biological child, which I thought could be a good compromise. So, I mentioned it to my wife as a way to ease my own anxiety about the whole situation.

She loved the idea of adoption, and I thought that might help me avoid the craziness of another pregnancy. But when I suggested it, I realized too late that I had made a mistake. She was all in, researching agencies and even wanting to meet with social workers. I started to panic. 

I didn’t want to adopt; I just wanted her to be happy and for us to avoid the stress of having another baby. So, I did something I now regret—I sabotaged the process. I told her I was on board, but deep down I was completely against it. When she would ask me about meeting with agencies, I would act enthusiastic, but I would secretly make excuses to avoid any real commitment.

Eventually, it all came to a head when she found out that I had been avoiding the conversations about the next steps in the adoption process. She was devastated and confronted me about why I seemed so disengaged. I panicked and told her that I just needed more time to think about it, but deep down I knew I was being dishonest. 

Now, I feel like I’ve let her down and potentially ruined our relationship over this. AITA for not being upfront about my feelings and sabotaging the adoption process? I just wanted to keep the peace and make her happy.",74,695,0.88,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_65519,2020-10-05 00:00:00,YTA,2803,AITA

A few weeks ago, while Sarah was out of town for a work trip, I took it upon myself to book a venue that I thought was stunning but completely different from what she had in mind. I also chose a color scheme that I thought would look ""better"" with the venue. I even sent out save-the-dates to her guest list because I was just so excited about what I had planned.

I was really excited to help them celebrate, especially since Rachel has always been there for me during tough times. I've been dating someone for a few months, and while things are going well, it’s still pretty new. I decided to bring my boyfriend, Tom, along to the party.

As the evening went on, I noticed that Rachel seemed a bit tense. I thought it might just be pre-wedding nerves, so I didn’t think much of it. During the party, I ended up getting a bit tipsy and started reminiscing about our college days. I began sharing some funny stories about Rachel and me, and I made a couple of jokes about how she used to have a major crush on Mark before they started dating. 

I could see Rachel getting uncomfortable, but I kept going because I thought it was all in good fun and everyone else was laughing. Then, I jokingly suggested that I should have been the one to get engaged first since I’m ""the better friend."" I thought it was a lighthearted jab, but Rachel’s face dropped. 

She pulled me aside and said, ""Can you please not make this about you? It's my engagement party, and I’d like to enjoy it without you throwing shade."" I laughed it off, thinking she was being overly sensitive, and told her she needed to lighten up. 

After the party, Tom told me that I might have crossed a line and that I should have been more considerate of Rachel’s feelings. I felt a bit defensive because I didn’t think I did anything wrong; I was just trying to have fun. But now I’m wondering if I was the one who overstepped.

You're the Asshole,"A few months ago, I (30M) moved into a new apartment complex. My neighbor, Mike (28M), introduced himself right away, and we got along pretty well. He’s a nice guy and we share a few interests, particularly video games and hiking. 

One day, Mike invited me over to play some games. I accepted, and while we were hanging out, he mentioned that he was struggling to pay his bills this month because of some unexpected expenses. He seemed pretty stressed about it, and I could tell he was embarrassed to bring it up.

Later that week, I decided to host a small get-together at my place and invited a few friends. I casually brought up Mike’s financial situation to my friends, joking about how he might need to sell some of his video games to make ends meet. I thought it was harmless humor, but it clearly made a couple of my friends uncomfortable. 

When Mike found out I mentioned his situation, he was visibly upset. He confronted me and said that I had betrayed his trust and made him feel like a joke. I brushed it off, thinking he was overreacting and that it was just a funny story. I told him he needed to lighten up and that I was just trying to be funny.

However, the problem started when Lily decided she wanted to take an art class at the community center. I thought it was a great idea and encouraged her to sign up. But when the class started, I noticed that Lily was really struggling with the techniques they were teaching, and it seemed to be frustrating her. Instead of being supportive, I ended up criticizing her drawings and telling her that if she wanted to be an artist, she needed to practice more and follow the teacher's instructions exactly.

Last week, after she came home from class in tears, I told her that she needed to stop being so sensitive and toughen up if she wanted to succeed. I also took away her art supplies for a week, saying she needed to focus on her schoolwork instead and that ""art is just a hobby."" My sister called me out on it, saying I was being too harsh and should let Lily explore her creativity without pressure. I brushed it off and insisted that I was just trying to help her improve.

Recently, he started dating this amazing girl named Sarah. She's sweet, funny, and they seem really happy together. I genuinely like her and think they make a great couple.

However, I started to feel a little jealous of their relationship. It seemed like Jake was spending all his free time with her, and I missed the close bond we used to have. To cope, I began hanging out with Sarah when Jake wasn’t around. At first, it was just casual chats, but over time, I began to confide in her more about my feelings of being left out. I would joke about how Jake was ""stealing"" her, making her laugh, but I think I crossed a line when I started dropping hints that maybe they weren't right for each other.

One day, I decided to take it a step further. I invited Sarah out for coffee without telling Jake. During our time together, I told her that I thought she deserved someone better than Jake, someone who would treat her like the queen she is. I know it sounds manipulative, but I just wanted her to see that she could do better. I thought I was being a good friend by looking out for her.

When Jake found out, he was understandably upset. He confronted me, and I downplayed it, telling him I was just being supportive of Sarah. But deep down, I knew I was trying to come between them. Now, Jake is furious with me, and Sarah feels betrayed. I can't help but think maybe I was just trying to get my best friend back, but I realize now that I may have messed things up.

After a couple of hours, I noticed that my friend’s dad had taken the cake I made and cut it into pieces to share with everyone. I got really upset about this because I felt like my homemade cake was being overshadowed and disrespected. I confronted my friend in a slightly rude way, saying that it was really inconsiderate of his dad to just take my cake without asking and that it would have been nice for him to let me know he was planning to do that.

My friend tried to explain that it was all in good fun and that his dad was just trying to share the love, but I insisted that he should have asked me first and that my baking deserved more recognition. I ended up sulking for the rest of the night and made the atmosphere tense.

They have a great connection, and I’ve always respected their relationship. However, I recently went through a tough breakup and was feeling pretty vulnerable.

One night, I was out with some friends and ended up texting Jake to vent about my feelings. I started telling him how I missed physical affection and companionship, and I jokingly suggested that if he ever wanted to have a “bro night,” we could cuddle. I thought it was a lighthearted way to cope, but Jake didn’t take it that way. He immediately got upset and told me that was crossing a line since he was in a committed relationship.

I didn’t think it was that big of a deal, and I just shrugged it off, insisting I was just joking. The next day, Jake told me that he felt really uncomfortable and that he needed some space from me. I didn’t understand why he was overreacting, so I sent him a few more texts trying to clarify that I was just joking and that it didn’t mean anything serious.

After that, I decided to reach out to Sarah directly because I thought maybe she could help bridge the gap. I texted her saying how I felt and that I was really sorry if I made Jake uncomfortable. I even mentioned that I just wanted to clear the air and still be friends, but I think I came off as a bit desperate.

Now, Jake isn’t talking to me, and Sarah told me that I needed to respect their boundaries and give him space.

She's always been super supportive of my dreams and even helped me out financially when I was struggling with my freelance work. Recently, I decided it was time to propose, so I started looking for a ring.

After searching for a while, I found a beautiful ring that I thought she'd love. It was a bit pricey, around $600, but I figured it was worth it for a special moment. However, I didn’t have enough money saved up, so I ended up putting it on my credit card without telling her. I convinced myself that it would all work out once I got more clients.

The proposal went great! She was over the moon and couldn’t stop crying. But shortly after, I started feeling guilty about the ring being on credit. I thought it would be okay to downplay how much it cost and casually mentioned it was more affordable than typical engagement rings. She seemed to take it at face value, but a few weeks later, I overheard her talking to a friend about how happy she was to have a ""real"" diamond ring.

I felt this sudden urge to come clean, so I told her that I actually bought it on credit and it wasn’t as expensive as she thought. She was visibly upset, and I tried to explain that I did it because I loved her and wanted to make her happy.

You see, I've been single for a while now, and I’ve been really wanting to find a partner myself. Last week, I threw a small engagement party for her to celebrate. During the party, I decided to give a toast and, in an attempt to be funny, I made a joke about how she should be careful not to lose her individuality and how relationships can be suffocating. 

Instead of laughing, she looked offended, and the mood in the room shifted. After a few awkward moments, I changed the subject, but I felt like I had ruined the moment. Later on, I overheard her telling another friend that my joke was inappropriate and made her feel uncomfortable. 

I feel bad for making her upset at a time that should have been happy for her. However, I also think I was just trying to lighten the mood and express my own feelings about relationships in a funny way.

As part of the meal, I made a lovely dessert that required a specific type of gourmet dark chocolate that I had been saving for a special occasion.

The night of the dinner, my friend Jane, who is known for being a bit picky, arrived and immediately expressed how she doesn't like dark chocolate. I thought it was no big deal and remarked that I had a little extra milk chocolate in the pantry if she wanted that instead. She declined, saying she was trying to eat healthier and didn't want to ruin her diet with chocolate.

As the evening went on, I noticed that Jane was not enjoying the dinner as much as the others. To lighten the mood, I jokingly suggested that I could just sprinkle a little bit of the dark chocolate on her plate to make it look fancy, even if she wasn't going to eat it. Everyone laughed, including Jane, but I could see she was a bit uncomfortable.

After dinner, I decided to serve the dessert, which was a rich dark chocolate mousse topped with fresh berries. I presented it to my guests, and everyone was thrilled. I turned to Jane and, in front of everyone, said, ""Come on, just a tiny bite won’t hurt! You might actually like it!"" I thought I was being funny and light-hearted, but she looked visibly upset and declined once again.

After the party, I received a message from her saying that I had embarrassed her in front of everyone and that I should have respected her dietary choices. I figured I was just trying to include her and make the dessert more fun. I didn't think it was a big deal since everyone else enjoyed it.

She's been open about feeling overwhelmed and has been seeing a therapist, which I'm really supportive of. However, I also believe that sometimes you need to toughen up a bit and face your problems head-on.

Recently, Sarah started dating this guy who seemed really nice at first. But I noticed that she was becoming overly reliant on him for her happiness, which made me uncomfortable. I mean, I get that she’s in a relationship, but I think it’s unhealthy to depend so much on someone else, especially when you’re already struggling with your mental health.

So, I decided to have a chat with her about it. I told her that she shouldn't lean on him too much and that it was important for her to find happiness within herself first. I suggested that maybe she should break up with him for a while to focus on herself, and I even told her that she might be ""suffocating"" him with her issues. 

Sarah was really upset and said that I was being unsupportive and that she felt like I was invalidating her feelings. I thought I was being a good friend by being honest and trying to help her see that she shouldn’t lose herself in a relationship.

I offered to help organize the event, and while discussing it with the group, I thought it would be a fun idea to have everyone wear silly dog-themed attire. I found a dog costume online that was a giant hot dog, and I thought it would be hilarious if I wore that to the memorial. I figured it would lighten the mood and give Sarah something to laugh about during such a sad time.

When I told Sarah about my plan, she didn't react the way I expected. She said she appreciated my intention to bring some joy, but she felt that it was inappropriate to make a joke out of the situation. I brushed her off, thinking she was just too sad to see the humor in it. I decided to go ahead with my costume anyway.

He’s been practicing hard and even made the junior varsity team this year. Our parents are super supportive and have been driving him to practices and games.

Last week, Jake had a big game that he was really excited about. I had a few friends over that night for a study session, and I didn’t feel like going to the game. When Jake asked me to come, I told him I was too busy and that he should just get over it if I didn’t show up. I also joked that it wasn’t like he was going to be playing in the NBA anyway.

When he found out I wasn’t coming, he looked really disappointed, and it kind of annoyed me. I thought he was being overly dramatic. I ended up telling my friends about it, and we laughed about how my brother was acting like it was the end of the world.

Later, my parents found out I didn’t attend the game, and they were upset with me. They said I should have been there to support Jake and that I was being a jerk. I don’t really see why it was such a big deal, but now I’m starting to feel guilty about how I treated him.

Over the past year, we've developed a friendly rapport. He always asks about my day and shares stories about his life, and I enjoy our conversations because he has a lot of interesting experiences to share.

A few months ago, he started bringing me little gifts, like a pastry he thought I might like or a book he recommended. I appreciated the gestures, but I never thought much about it. I just figured he was being friendly and generous, and I always made sure to thank him.

Last week, he came in and asked if I wanted to join him for lunch sometime. I jokingly said, “As long as you’re buying!” We both laughed, but he seemed serious and said he'd really enjoy it. I brushed it off and told him I was busy with work but appreciated the offer.

Fast forward to a few days later, he came in and handed me a bouquet of flowers. I was caught off guard and felt uncomfortable, but I smiled and thanked him. Then, he told me how much he enjoyed our conversations and said he was starting to develop feelings for me. I didn’t know how to respond, so I awkwardly laughed it off and said I was flattered but that I was focused on my career right now.

To celebrate his promotion, he planned a small gathering with our close friends. I decided to show up but couldn’t shake off this nagging feeling of jealousy. During the party, everyone was praising him and sharing stories about his hard work, and instead of joining in on the compliments, I made some snarky comments about how he must have “sold his soul” to get ahead. I thought I was being funny, but the room fell silent, and my friend looked hurt.

After that, I continued to make jokes about his new position, saying things like, “Just remember us little people when you’re a big shot!” I thought I was being lighthearted, but I could see my friend’s smile fading. Eventually, he pulled me aside and told me that I was ruining the celebration with my comments. I got defensive and told him he was being too sensitive, which caused an argument.

Now, a few days later, he's still upset with me, and I feel like I was just trying to joke around. AITA?",846,977,0.71,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_40600,2019-05-07 00:00:00,YTA,1263,AITA

Last week, we were out with some friends when the topic of career ambitions came up. My girlfriend mentioned that she might want to take a break from work and focus on herself for a while, which I thought was a bit irresponsible given her current situation. 

In front of everyone, I jokingly said, ""Maybe you should just find a rich guy to take care of you!"" Everyone laughed, but I could see my girlfriend's face change. She didn't laugh and later told me that my comment was really hurtful and undermined her efforts to find a new job. 

I didn't think it was a big deal – I was just trying to lighten the mood. But now she's been distant and upset with me. Our friends have also mentioned that I might have crossed a line. I still believe I was just joking and that she overreacted, but I can see why she's upset.

You're the Asshole,"So, I (28M) have a younger sister (22F) who just graduated college and recently got a job offer that she’s really excited about. She’s been working hard and deserves to celebrate, so my family planned a small gathering at our house with close relatives to congratulate her. 

I, however, had a different idea. I’ve been trying to lose weight and get in shape, and I’ve been really focused on my fitness routine lately. So, when I heard about the celebration, I asked my family if we could skip the food and just do a workout session instead. I suggested we do a group workout, and I even offered to lead it since I’ve been getting into personal training. 

My family was taken aback and tried to explain that they wanted to enjoy the celebration with food, cake, and toasting my sister’s achievements. I insisted that working out together would be more fun and memorable, and I basically pushed for it. I thought it would be a great bonding experience and would help everyone get a jumpstart on their fitness goals. 

In the end, we ended up having the workout session, but my sister was really disappointed because she felt her celebration was overshadowed by my obsession with fitness. She told me that she wished we could have just had a normal celebration with food and fun. Now I’m feeling guilty and wondering if I was too wrapped up in my own goals to recognize what was important for my sister.

I love cooking, and I spent all afternoon preparing a nice meal, complete with an appetizer, main course, and dessert. I also set the mood by putting on some music that I really enjoy—mostly indie and alternative rock.

As the guests arrived, I noticed that one of my friends, Lucy, seemed a bit off. She was scrolling through her phone and not engaging in the conversation. Eventually, she asked if we could change the music to something more upbeat, like pop or hip-hop, because she found the current playlist too slow and moody for a party atmosphere.

I was taken aback. I had put a lot of effort into curating the music to match the cozy vibe I was trying to create with the dinner. It felt like she didn't appreciate my choices. I politely told her that I really liked this playlist and wanted to keep it playing for the night. Lucy seemed a bit disappointed but dropped the subject.

As the night went on, she continued to look disinterested and even suggested that we all go out instead of staying in. I started feeling frustrated because I felt my efforts were being undermined. Eventually, I decided to ignore her cues and just focused on enjoying the evening with the others, who seemed to be having a good time.

My partner, however, thought I should have been more accommodating and switched the music for Lucy, considering it was a group gathering. He reminded me that not everyone shares the same taste in music and that part of hosting is making everyone feel comfortable.

A couple of weeks ago, my stepdaughter came to me with a school project that required some craft supplies. She was very excited about it, and I wanted to help her out. However, I was a little overwhelmed with my own work and didn’t feel like going out to buy supplies at that moment. Instead of encouraging her creativity, I snapped and told her to just use what she had at home.

She looked crushed, and I immediately regretted my tone. My partner was upset with me and said that I should have been more supportive. I brushed it off, saying it was just a small incident and she needed to learn to be independent.

Fast forward a few days, I found out that my stepdaughter was really looking forward to doing the project but ended up not doing it because she felt discouraged. When my partner told me about it, I got defensive. I explained that I wasn’t her mother and shouldn’t have to be responsible for every aspect of her upbringing. I insisted that it was important for her to learn to figure things out on her own instead of relying on adults all the time.

My partner was furious with me, and I didn’t understand why he was making such a big deal out of it. I think I was just tired and stressed, and I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings, but I feel like I don’t owe her anything beyond being a good stepmom.

As we played, I noticed one of my colleagues, Sarah, was really good at pool. I wanted to impress everyone, so I challenged her to a one-on-one game. I bet $20 that I could beat her. Sarah seemed a bit hesitant but agreed to the bet.

The game started and I quickly realized I was out of my league. Sarah was making all the shots while I struggled to keep up. In a moment of desperation, I decided to start playing dirty—I knocked the cue ball to mess with her shots and tried to distract her by making loud noises and talking during her turns. 

Sarah was clearly annoyed but kept her cool and focused on the game. I ended up losing the match, and I was embarrassed. Instead of owning up to my bad behavior, I doubled down and told everyone that I only lost because she was cheating, even though I knew that wasn’t true.

My colleagues were disappointed in me for not being a good sport, and after the game, they expressed their frustration about my behavior. I brushed it off, thinking they were overreacting. Later, Sarah confronted me and told me that she didn’t appreciate my attitude and that it ruined a fun night.

I thought I was being playful and motivating, but she went quiet and just looked at me.

I generally keep to myself and I don’t get involved in other people’s business. However, there’s one thing that has been bothering me.

My neighbor, Sarah (32F), has a small dog that she loves dearly. I can see how much she cares for her pet, but the problem is that her dog barks excessively whenever she leaves the apartment. I work from home, and the constant barking has become really distracting. It’s not just a little yapping; it’s a full-on chorus of barking that can go on for hours.

I decided to approach Sarah about it because I’m sure she’s not aware of how loud and disruptive it is. However, when I brought it up, she got defensive and said that her dog is just expressing herself and that I should be more understanding. I felt bad for her but also felt like I needed a solution.

I (27f) have a younger brother (24m) who has been dating his girlfriend for about a year. They seem happy, and I genuinely like her. However, she has a tendency to be a bit overly serious and sensitive about certain topics. For example, she’s very into animal rights and is a strict vegetarian. While I respect her views, I sometimes joke around about food in a way that isn't meant to offend anyone—like playfully teasing about bacon or my love for steak.

Last weekend, my family had a barbecue, and of course, I brought some burgers and hot dogs. While grilling, I made a light-hearted comment about how “life is too short not to enjoy a good cheeseburger!” I laughed, but I quickly noticed my brother’s girlfriend looking visibly upset. I brushed it off, thinking she was overreacting, and continued joking with my brother about how delicious the food was.

Later that evening, she pulled me aside and told me that my jokes were hurtful and that I should be more considerate of people’s dietary choices.

You're the Asshole,"I recently attended a wedding for a close friend, and I was really excited about it. I had bought a beautiful dress and even got my hair done for the occasion. However, when I arrived, I noticed that many of the guests were wearing more casual attire, and some were even in jeans and t-shirts.

Feeling a bit out of place, I decided to make a comment about it to my friend, the bride. I said something like, “Wow, I didn’t realize this was a casual wedding! I feel a bit overdressed.” I thought it was a light-hearted joke, but she looked really uncomfortable and told me that she had wanted to create a relaxed atmosphere and that she hoped everyone would feel comfortable.

Later in the evening, I saw her talking to someone else and noticed she was visibly upset. I found out from another guest that she was feeling stressed because of my comment and how it made her feel like she had misjudged the vibe she wanted for her wedding.

You're the Asshole,"So, I recently attended a family gathering for my cousin's wedding. It was a pretty big event with all our relatives, and I was really excited to see everyone. The wedding was held outdoors in a beautiful garden, and the dress code was semi-formal.

I decided to wear a dress that I thought was stunning and really showcased my figure. It was a tight, low-cut, sparkly red dress that I purchased specifically for the occasion. I felt confident and like I stood out—maybe a bit too much, but I thought it was okay for a wedding.

When I arrived, I noticed that most of my relatives were dressed in more traditional semi-formal attire—dresses that were classy and elegant without being overly revealing. My mom gave me a look that suggested she was a bit uncomfortable, but I just brushed it off, thinking she was being overly cautious.

As the evening progressed, I received a mix of compliments and some awkward glances. My aunt even pulled me aside and quietly told me that while she admired my confidence, it might have been better to choose something a little more subdued for a family event. I laughed it off, saying it was a wedding, and I wanted to look my best.

Things escalated when my uncle, who I hadn’t seen in years, made a comment about my dress being more appropriate for a nightclub than a wedding. I rolled my eyes and said that he was just being old-fashioned. My cousin, the bride, later approached me, looking a bit tense. She told me that while she loved that I was confident, she wished I had considered the vibe of the event a bit more. 

I felt embarrassed but defended my choice, saying it was my body, and I should be able to wear what I want. I didn’t think I was doing anything wrong by wanting to look good. I mean, it was a celebration, right? 

Now that I've had some time to reflect, I do feel a bit guilty for making my cousin uncomfortable on her special day.

You're the Asshole,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. This is a bit of a messy situation, so I’ll try to lay it out clearly.

I have a younger sister, let’s call her Lisa, who just turned 21. We’ve always had a close relationship, and I’ve always been protective of her. Recently, she started dating a guy we’ll call Jake. They’ve been together for about six months, and while I was initially skeptical, I decided to give him a chance.

Last week, Lisa invited me to a small gathering at her place to celebrate her birthday. She was super excited about it, and I thought it would be a great way to bond and show her how much I care. However, when I arrived, I immediately noticed that Jake had invited a bunch of his friends too, which made the gathering a lot bigger than I expected. 

I felt really uncomfortable because I didn’t know any of them, and I thought it was unfair that Lisa had turned her birthday into a party for Jake and his friends. I confronted her about it and told her that it felt like she was prioritizing him over our sisterly bond on her special day. She seemed pretty hurt by my comment, saying she just wanted to celebrate with everyone she cared about. 

In a moment of frustration, I called Jake out for inviting his friends without consulting Lisa first. I said it was disrespectful to her, especially on her birthday, and that she deserved better. It turned into a big argument, and Lisa ended up in tears. I felt bad, but I thought I was standing up for her.

After that, I left the party feeling justified. I didn’t reach out to Lisa for a couple of days because I thought she needed to see that Jake wasn’t the right guy for her. Eventually, she texted me saying she needed space and that I had ruined her birthday. It hit me hard, and I realized maybe I had overstepped.

Looking back, I know I was being controlling and didn’t handle the situation well. I was just trying to protect my sister, but I ended up hurting her instead. AITA for confronting Jake and ruining Lisa’s birthday?",837,1155,0.53,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_36614,2020-04-26 00:00:00,YTA,2005,AITA

Yesterday, Lily called me in tears saying that her fiancé’s family is causing drama and she needs my help to deal with the situation. She asked if I could come over this weekend to help her sort things out instead of attending my own party.

So, I recently went to a family gathering at my aunt's house. It was a pretty big event with a lot of relatives, and the vibe was generally cheerful. At one point, my little cousin, who is about 8 years old, was showing off his new toy robot. He was really excited and wanted to demonstrate how it worked.

Honestly, I was a bit annoyed because I just wanted to relax and catch up with my family. When he began to demonstrate the robot, I noticed that it was making a lot of noise, and I found it irritating. Instead of being supportive, I started mocking him in a joking tone, saying things like, “Wow, that’s so cool, but can it do my chores?” I thought I was being funny, but I could see his face drop a little.

Instead of stopping there, I decided to escalate it. I took the robot from him without asking and pretended to break it by dramatically throwing it onto the couch. I thought it would be a funny joke, but I didn’t realize how much it would upset him. He started to cry, and the whole room went silent. My aunt rushed over to see what was wrong, and my cousin was really hurt, saying he just wanted to share something cool with me.

I felt guilty after seeing how upset he was, but I also thought I was just being playful and having a bit of fun. I apologized, but I could tell that my cousin didn’t really want to talk to me after that.

You're the Asshole,"Title: AITA for insisting on naming my dog after my late grandfather despite my family's objections?

Last year, my grandfather passed away. He was one of the most important people in my life, and I have wonderful memories of our time together. When my partner and I decided to adopt a puppy, I immediately thought of naming him after my grandfather, who was named Harold. I love the name Harold and think it would be a great tribute to him.

However, when I excitedly shared the name with my family, I was met with a mixed reaction. My mom was particularly upset, saying that she found the idea distasteful. She explained that Harold had a difficult life in his later years, and naming my dog after him felt disrespectful to her and the rest of my family, who still carry some of the pain from those times.

I understand where she’s coming from, but I love the name Harold and can’t help but feel that it honors his memory. My partner supports my decision and thinks it would be a fun way to keep my grandfather’s spirit alive.

Despite my family's objections, I ended up naming the puppy Harold, and I posted about it on social media, sharing pictures and expressing my love for my grandfather. This caused a bit of a rift in the family, with some relatives agreeing with my mom and others saying it's just a name.

Now, I feel torn. I love my puppy and the name, but I see how much it hurt my mom and some of my family members. I think they should just accept my choice and get over it, but I’ve started to wonder if I might be being insensitive.

Last weekend, our family had a big celebration for my parents’ anniversary, and everyone was invited, including Jake. I was tasked with cooking the main dish, which I took very seriously. I spent all day preparing a delicious homemade lasagna, and I was really proud of how it turned out.

During dinner, I noticed that Emily and Jake were sitting together and seemed to be having a good time, so I was happy about that. However, as the evening progressed, I heard Emily making a couple of jokes at Jake’s expense. They were lighthearted at first, but then they began getting a little more pointed. I could see Jake getting uncomfortable, but he was trying to laugh it off.

I thought it might be best to intervene. I jokingly said, “Hey Emily, don’t scare him away with those jokes!” I meant it in a lighthearted way, but she shot back, “Oh, please, he can take it! Right, Jake?” Jake awkwardly laughed, but the tension in his face was clear.

After a few more jabs, I said, “Honestly, it seems like you’re being a bit harsh. Just let him enjoy dinner.” Emily then snapped back at me, saying I was overreacting and that it was all just in good fun. I lost my patience and said, “Maybe you should stop being so mean and actually let him enjoy the evening instead of putting him down.”

Things got awkward after that. Emily looked hurt, and Jake didn’t know what to say. They ended up leaving the dinner early, which made everyone uncomfortable.

Now my family is divided. Some think I was right to stand up for Jake, while others feel I should have stayed out of it. Emily hasn’t spoken to me since, and I can see she’s really upset.

I feel bad about how it turned out, and while I don’t think I was completely wrong, I can’t help but think I could have handled it differently. Maybe I overstepped?

We have a team of six, and for the past few months, my colleague Alex (30M) has been working on a big project that I was supposed to assist him with. From the start, there was tension because I felt he was quite dismissive of my ideas and contributions, often overriding my suggestions during meetings.

Last week, during the final stages of the project, Alex started to get really stressed. He was working long hours, and I could tell he was overwhelmed. Instead of offering to help him out, I took the opportunity to showcase my skills. I spent a couple of nights working on the presentation slides and made them look really polished. When we presented to the client, I ended up taking most of the credit for the design work, even though Alex had done the bulk of the foundational work.

After the meeting, the client praised me for the design, and I felt really good about it. I didn’t mention Alex’s contributions at all. When I got back to the office, Alex confronted me about it. He was clearly upset and felt undermined. I told him that he should have made his work more visible if he wanted credit and that I was just trying to make sure our project succeeded.

He started streaming on Twitch over a year ago and has been pretty successful at it. My parents have been very supportive of his passion, buying him equipment and letting him use the living room for his streams.

I’m not really into gaming, but I have my own interests, like music and photography. Recently, I decided to host a small gathering at our house to share my photography with friends and family. I thought it would be a nice change of pace and a way to showcase my work. I asked Alex if I could borrow his streaming setup to display my portfolio online during the event, explaining that it would help me reach a wider audience.

Instead of being supportive, Alex completely flipped out. He told me that this was his space, his setup, and that I was being selfish for wanting to use it for my own benefit. I tried to reason with him, saying that I wouldn’t be using it for long and that it was just for a few hours, but he refused to budge. In frustration, I went ahead and set up my laptop and projector on the dining table instead, which meant I had to rearrange the furniture and it turned out to be a hassle.

During the event, I could see Alex sulking in his room, and I felt a bit guilty but also annoyed. I thought it was ridiculous that he couldn’t share a little bit, especially since I had shared my space with him countless times for his gaming marathons. After the event, I confronted him and told him he was being an asshole for not letting me use his setup. He called me selfish and said I should have respected his boundaries.

He prefers more adventurous and individual activities, while our friends are into relaxing and sightseeing. To keep him happy, I suggested that we take turns planning activities - one day for the group and one day for just us. Everyone agreed to this compromise.

When we got to the destination, however, my partner started sulking whenever it was a ""group day."" He would complain about the itinerary and often refuse to participate. It made things awkward, and I noticed that my friends were getting frustrated with him. Instead of talking to him about it, I started to feel embarrassed and anxious about him ruining the trip. 

On our second group day, when everyone was excited about visiting a famous museum, my partner outright refused to go, saying it was boring. I ended up feeling really torn and decided to stay with him instead of going with my friends. I told them to go on without us, but they were disappointed and said they wanted us all to be together.

I told Emily that I didn’t want to spend extra money on things I already had at home, so I asked if I could borrow some of her stuff for the weekend. She initially seemed fine with it, but when we got there, she didn't want me to use her clothes or hygiene products because she said she didn’t want them to smell like me.

I got frustrated and told her it was ridiculous to not share with someone you're dating and that it was just for a couple of days. I insisted I could just use her things anyway, claiming it wouldn’t hurt anything, and I threw a small fit about it. She ended up giving in, but I could tell she was uncomfortable. 

Later, during dinner with her family, I jokingly said something about her being stingy with her stuff, and her parents looked shocked. Emily was clearly embarrassed, and when we got back to the cabin, she told me I had crossed a line. I told her she was overreacting and that she should lighten up. 

Now I’m wondering if I was too harsh on her. AITA?",956,2949,0.69,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_69061,2022-07-23 00:00:00,YTA,1325,AITA
You're the Asshole,"My best friend recently got engaged, and I was really excited for her. She asked me to be her maid of honor, and of course, I said yes. However, when we started planning the bachelorette party, I felt like I should have a say in the activities since I was going to be in charge of organizing it.

I suggested that we go to a quiet beach resort for a relaxing weekend. My friend, however, wanted a wild party in the city with a lot of nightlife, which is not really my style. I dismissed her idea as too chaotic and insisted that the beach would be more enjoyable for her and the other guests. After all, I know what she really needs before her big day!

When she pushed back about wanting a fun party in the city, I argued that it wasn’t really about her — it was about what she needed to unwind. Instead of considering her feelings, I went ahead and booked the beach resort anyway, thinking she’d come around once she saw how great it would be. 

When I told her about the plans, she was furious, saying I had completely disregarded her wishes. I tried to justify my decision by saying she was being too focused on partying and that I was doing this out of love. She ended up telling me that I was being selfish and controlling. Now she’s considering asking someone else to be her maid of honor.

You're the Asshole,"So, I recently got into a bit of a disagreement with my coworkers during lunch. We were discussing an upcoming company workshop on public speaking, and I overheard my colleague, Sarah, mention that she was really nervous about presenting because she struggles with anxiety. I chimed in, trying to lighten the mood, and said something along the lines of, “Honestly, just pretend you’re talking to your pets. They don’t judge you!”

The conversation shifted, and it turned out that my other coworker, Mike, had a pretty serious fear of speaking in public as well. Instead of being supportive, I jokingly said to him that he should just “man up” and face his fears, that nobody cares if he stumbles or messes up. I thought I was being helpful by trying to encourage him, but Sarah immediately called me out, saying that I was being insensitive to their feelings.

I insisted that I was just trying to make light of the situation since everyone gets nervous at some point. I even shared a story about how I had to give a presentation in front of the whole company last year and how I visibly bombed it but learned to laugh about it. I expected them to relate, but instead, they both seemed offended.

Now, I really don’t think I did anything wrong. I mean, we were just joking around, and I was trying to show that it’s not the end of the world if you mess up. Mike seemed to brush it off, but Sarah was clearly upset, and I told her she was being overly sensitive. I still don’t understand why they reacted that way, but I can't help but wonder if I might be the asshole here for not being more considerate of their feelings.",38,1150,0.97,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_86181,2018-05-25 00:00:00,YTA,1622,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I (35M) have a brother (30M) who recently got engaged. He and his fiancée are planning a small wedding, and I was thrilled for them. However, I've always been a bit of a traditionalist when it comes to weddings. I believe that the wedding day should be a grand event, celebrated with a large gathering of friends and family. 

When I heard that my brother's wedding would only have about 30 guests, I was disappointed. I expressed my feelings to him, telling him that he should reconsider and make it a larger celebration. I even suggested that they hold the wedding at a bigger venue and invite more people. He told me that they wanted a simple and intimate ceremony, but I couldn’t understand why they wouldn’t want to celebrate with more loved ones.

Feeling frustrated, I took it upon myself to create a group chat with our extended family and started discussing the idea of throwing them a surprise engagement party, framing it as a way to celebrate their love more broadly. I didn't consult my brother or his fiancée beforehand. I just assumed they would appreciate it.

When I finally told my brother about the engagement party plans, he was upset. He said he and his fiancée didn’t want a big celebration and that it was their decision to keep things small. I brushed off his concerns, saying he would appreciate it once it happened. But he insisted that I cancel everything, which I found unreasonable.

I ended up going ahead with the party planning anyway, thinking he would change his mind. When he found out, he was furious with me. My parents also sided with him, saying I overstepped and disrespected their wishes. I genuinely believed I was doing something nice for him, so it hurt when they called me selfish.

Now, I'm left wondering if I really messed up. I just wanted to celebrate my brother in a way I thought he deserved. Am I the asshole here?",231,1409,0.88,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_68593,2021-11-21 00:00:00,YTA,1867,AITA

Over the past few years, she's been showing her work in local galleries and even sold a few pieces. I'm really proud of her, but I also have some concerns about her lifestyle.

Mia has a new boyfriend, Jake (26), who is a musician. He’s talented, but he’s also quite irresponsible. He often plays gigs but rarely brings in a steady income. They’ve been together for about six months, and I feel like Mia’s life has become all about Jake. She’s been spending more time at his gigs and less time working on her own art, which is frustrating to see.

Recently, Mia invited me to a joint art and music festival where she was supposed to showcase her work. I was excited to go and support her, but I found out Jake was going to perform too. I know how much attention he draws, and I worried that Mia would end up being overshadowed. So, I told Mia that I wasn’t sure I wanted to go anymore if it meant Jake would steal her thunder. 

Mia was upset and insisted that I should support her no matter what, but I told her that I didn’t want to be at an event where her boyfriend would take the spotlight from her. I ended up not going, and Mia was really hurt. She said it felt like I didn’t believe in her or her work, and that stung.

I think I was justified in not attending because I wanted to protect her from being overshadowed, but everyone else says I was a jerk for not supporting her. I’ve been reflecting on it, and I think I might have overreacted.

You're the Asshole,"A few months ago, I (28M) inherited a vintage car from my late grandfather, who had lovingly restored it over many years. It’s a beautiful classic car, and I’ve always had a passion for cars, but I’ve never had the space or resources to maintain it properly. My grandfather left a note with the car expressing his hope that I would take care of it and enjoy it as much as he did.

After some thought, I decided I wanted to sell the car. I figured I could use the money to pay off some debts and put a down payment on a house. I know it’s sentimental, but I didn’t feel a strong enough connection to the car to keep it, especially since I don’t have a garage or the funds to restore it. 

My sister (30F), who was very close to our grandfather, found out about my decision and was furious. She argued that I was disrespecting his memory and that the car should stay in the family as a cherished heirloom. I tried to explain my situation and how I didn’t see myself using it, but she just kept saying I was being selfish and that I needed to honor our grandfather’s legacy.

Despite her protests, I went ahead and listed the car for sale, and a few weeks later, I sold it for a good price. When I told my sister, she was heartbroken and accused me of betraying our grandfather’s wishes. I feel a bit guilty, but I also think I made the right decision for my current situation.

Now, I’m starting to doubt myself. Did I truly go against our grandfather’s wishes? A part of me thinks I could have found a way to keep it, but the financial burden was weighing heavily on me, and I felt it was the best choice at the time. I never meant to hurt my sister, but I also don’t think I should have to keep something I have no ability to care for.

You're the Asshole,"So, a few months ago, my younger brother got engaged to his girlfriend, and they decided to have a small, intimate wedding with just close family and friends. They asked me to be the best man, which I was honored to do. However, during the planning process, I found out that my brother's fiancée wanted to have a ""no kids"" policy for the wedding. She has strong feelings about wanting it to be an adult-only event, mainly because she wants to avoid the chaos that comes with having kids around.

Now, here's where I might have gone wrong. I have a three-year-old daughter, and I really wanted to bring her to the wedding. I think it’s a special occasion, and I wanted her to be part of the family celebration. But after hearing the couple's wishes, I insisted that it wouldn’t be a problem if she came and that they shouldn't be so strict about it. I was adamant that they would regret not including kids at such a joyful event.

I even started arguing with my brother about it and made a big deal out of it during family gatherings, pushing my point of view. I said things like, “You guys will look back and wish you had allowed kids; it’s a wedding!” I argued that weddings are family events and kids should be allowed to celebrate too.

Ultimately, my brother and his fiancée stood their ground and decided to stick to their original plan. I was upset and even considered not attending the wedding if my daughter couldn’t come because I felt so strongly about it.

Looking back, I realize I may have overstepped and created unnecessary tension within the family over a policy that was really none of my business. I feel bad about how I handled the situation, but I still think it would have been nicer to have children at the wedding.

Last week, she mentioned that she wanted to have a romantic dinner at home to celebrate our anniversary, which I thought was a sweet idea.

The day of our anniversary, I decided to surprise her by cooking dinner. I knew she loved Italian food, so I went all out and made a homemade lasagna. I put in a lot of effort, and it turned out really well. I also bought a bottle of her favorite wine.

When she got home, she was really excited and loved the effort I put into the meal. However, after dinner, she wanted to take some nice pictures for social media to remember the night. I was happy to pose with her and smile for the camera.

But then she asked if I could wear a more fitted shirt for the pictures because the one I was wearing was baggy. I hesitated but ultimately agreed and changed into a shirt that I didn’t feel comfortable in. I told her that I didn't really like how it fit, but she insisted it would look better in photos. 

We took a bunch of pictures, and she seemed really happy with them. However, later that night, she started talking about how I should dress better in general, especially when we go out together. She said that my style didn’t match hers and that I should make more of an effort to dress nice to ""elevate"" her look.

I became defensive and told her that I like how I dress and that I didn't appreciate her trying to change me. She got upset and said I was being stubborn and that it was just about wanting us to look good together.

I ended up saying that if she wanted someone who dressed a certain way, maybe she should date someone else. It was an emotional moment, and I felt like she was trying to control me. After we calmed down, I apologized for saying that, but I still think she was being unreasonable.

He has a female friend from college, and they’ve been friends for years. I always felt a bit uneasy about their friendship, but I tried to be cool and supportive. Recently, they planned a weekend getaway to a cabin with some other friends. I thought it was a little strange that he would go away with her, but I didn't want to come off as controlling, so I didn’t say anything.

While they were away, I found out from one of my friends that they were sharing a room together. I felt really hurt and betrayed. When he got back, I confronted him about it. I told him that I didn't like the idea of him sharing a room with her and that it made me uncomfortable. He tried to explain that it was just a group trip and that they weren’t doing anything inappropriate, but I just couldn’t shake the feeling that it was wrong.

I ended up telling him that if he valued our relationship, he shouldn’t be hanging out with her or sharing rooms with her anymore. He said I was being unreasonable and asked if he could not have any female friends if it bothered me so much. I got really defensive and told him that I deserved to feel secure in our relationship, which I thought justified my reaction.

Then, in a moment of bad judgment, I decided to tell her that I wanted to take things further without really gauging how she felt about it. I just assumed since we were kissing, she was down for more. So, I started to undress her a bit, but she suddenly pushed me away and looked really upset.

She told me that I should have asked her if she was comfortable with that and that it felt really wrong for me to just assume. I felt embarrassed and tried to laugh it off, but she was clearly not having it. She stormed out of the room, and I just stood there feeling like an idiot.

When I came back to the party, I sensed that something went wrong. A few friends asked if I was okay, and I tried to downplay it. I ended up leaving early, feeling super embarrassed about everything.

She agreed but then proceeded to make all the decisions without consulting me. She chose to order a bunch of takeout instead of cooking, which I thought was a bit lazy for a family gathering.

The new partner's child started to get a bit rowdy, grabbing toys from my niece and not listening to the boundaries that were set by the adults. It was becoming disruptive, and my niece started to cry. Instead of addressing the situation, my sister just told her partner to ""let him be"" and to ""not stifle his creativity.""

I felt justified in stepping in because it was affecting all the kids' enjoyment of the day. The child looked at me, confused, and I admit I may have raised my voice a little too much. My sister overheard and came over, clearly upset.

She told me it wasn't my place to reprimand her partner's child and that I was being too harsh. I argued back that I was only trying to help and that the child needed to learn how to share. My sister ended up really upset, and the atmosphere of the gathering became tense.

I understood the reasoning, but I have a three-year-old daughter, and I didn't feel comfortable leaving her with a babysitter for an entire evening. My sister insisted that the rule was non-negotiable, and while I respected that, I got a bit upset. I decided to take matters into my own hands.

The day of the wedding, I dressed my daughter in a nice little outfit and brought her to the restaurant with me, thinking I could just keep her quiet and out of the way. I figured it was a family event, and I could manage her without disturbing anyone. As soon as we arrived, my daughter got restless and started running around, laughing and playing. I kept trying to shush her, but it was clear she was too excited to stay quiet for long.

A few guests shot me disapproving looks, and my sister was visibly upset when she saw us. She came over and asked me to take my daughter outside, explaining that the noise was disrupting the ceremony. I got defensive and told her it was my daughter’s family too, and she shouldn't be so uptight. I argued that she should be more understanding, given the circumstances. 

Eventually, my sister asked me to leave the reception entirely, which led to a big confrontation. I took my daughter home, feeling like I had been wronged. I thought I was just trying to have my daughter included in a special family moment.

So, AITA for bringing my daughter to my sister’s wedding despite her strict no-kids policy?",942,2941,0.99,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_88170,2018-04-06 00:00:00,YTA,1836,AITA
You're the Asshole,"Last weekend, I went to a local coffee shop to grab a quick drink before heading to meet some friends. It was a busy Saturday, and the place was packed. While I was waiting for my order, I noticed a couple of kids running around and playing, and their parents were sitting at a nearby table, mostly absorbed in their phones.

At one point, one of the kids bumped into me while running and spilled some of my drink. I was annoyed but decided to brush it off because kids will be kids. However, the parents didn’t even notice; they just kept scrolling on their phones.

A few minutes later, the kids came back and started making more noise, running around the tables. I felt my patience wearing thin, especially since it was so crowded and I was trying to enjoy my drink. I walked over to the parents and politely mentioned that their kids were being a bit disruptive and that it would be nice if they could keep them seated. 

The dad looked up from his phone, rolled his eyes, and told me to chill out because kids are supposed to have fun. I responded that my enjoyment of my drink shouldn’t be interrupted by their lack of supervision. The mom chimed in, saying that kids need to be kids and maybe I just wasn’t used to being around children. 

Feeling frustrated, I decided to take it a step further. I went to the manager and complained about the kids running around and how it was affecting the atmosphere of the coffee shop. The manager approached the parents and asked them to keep the kids seated, which led to an awkward scene where they gathered their things and left, clearly upset.

When I told my friends about it later, they said I was an asshole for ruining the parents' day out just because I wanted some peace and quiet. They said I should have just let it go, and that I overreacted. But I felt it was my right to enjoy my drink without distractions.

You're the Asshole,"I (34M) have a younger brother, Jake (25M), who is married to his high school sweetheart, Mia (24F). They’ve been together for about seven years now. Jake and Mia are both really into fitness, and they’ve become quite the social media couple, posting workout videos and healthy meal prep tips. They've gained a decent following, and they love sharing their fitness journey.

I'm not into fitness at all. I don't particularly enjoy working out, and I have a more laid-back lifestyle. I’m fine with who I am, but I think Jake has started to look down on me for not being as health-conscious or active as he is. He often tries to get me to join him and Mia for workouts or to go on hikes, but I've politely declined every time.

For Mia's birthday, I thought it'd be a nice gesture to give her something thoughtful, so I decided to buy her a high-end yoga mat that she had mentioned wanting. I knew it would be a hit with her, and I wanted to show her I appreciated her as part of the family.

When I presented the gift to Mia at their birthday party, Jake reacted poorly. He accused me of trying to undermine their fitness lifestyle and said I was being passive-aggressive for not getting him a gift too. He claimed I was being selfish and that I didn’t support their healthy lifestyle. I tried to explain that I thought the gift would make Mia happy, but he insisted that by not including him, I was being a jerk.

I got frustrated and told Jake that he was overreacting and that he needed to chill. I said I wasn’t going to pretend to be someone I’m not just to fit into their fitness world. Now, Jake and Mia aren’t speaking to me, and I feel confused about whether I did something wrong. My friends think I was just trying to be thoughtful, but I worry that maybe I should have considered Jake’s feelings more.

You're the Asshole,"I need to get this off my chest, and I think I might be in the wrong here. 

So, about three months ago, my best friend got engaged to her long-time boyfriend. They’ve been together for over five years, and I was really happy for her. We’ve been close since college, and I even introduced them, so I thought it was great that they were finally taking this step.

Here's where I messed up: a few weeks after the proposal, I started to feel really envious. I’ve been single for a while now, and the more I saw her planning her wedding, the more it made me feel inadequate about my own love life. I know it sounds terrible, but I started making little snide comments about her wedding plans whenever we hung out. Like, I’d say things like, “Are you sure you want to spend that much on flowers? It’s just going to wilt, you know.” 

Then, on the day of her bridal shower, I was invited and the atmosphere was so happy and celebratory. But instead of just enjoying the day with her, I ended up bringing up how unrealistic it is to think that marriage is all sunshine and rainbows. I told her that most marriages end up in divorce, and she should consider that before she goes all in. I could see her face fall, and I felt awful in that moment, but part of me thought I was just being realistic.

After the shower, she pulled me aside and told me that my comments were really hurtful and that she expected better support from me as her friend. I snapped back and said that I was just trying to help her see the bigger picture. Now, she hasn't spoken to me since, and I feel guilty about the whole thing.

I (28F) have a younger brother, Jake (25M), who recently got engaged to his girlfriend, Emily (26F). They met about a year ago and hit it off immediately. Emily is really nice, and I genuinely like her. However, there's one thing that's been bothering me: Emily is really into fitness and health, while I've always been more of a casual eater and not super into working out.

Recently, Jake and Emily decided to host a “healthy living” dinner party and invited the whole family. The idea was for everyone to try out some of their ""favorite healthy recipes."" I was fine with attending until I got a look at the menu. It was all things like quinoa salads, kale smoothies, and a bunch of things I’ve never heard of. I knew I wouldn’t enjoy it, and I was honestly a bit put off by how pretentious it felt. 

So, instead of just abstaining from the meal, I decided to bake my famous chocolate chip cookies and bring them along. I thought it would be a fun treat for everyone to enjoy after the healthy meal. But when I got there, Emily looked at my cookies with disdain and said they didn’t fit the theme of the dinner. I brushed it off and served them anyway, thinking people would appreciate a little sweetness after all that healthy food.

Well, Jake pulled me aside and told me I was being inconsiderate of Emily's efforts to promote a healthy lifestyle. He said that I should've respected their theme and not brought my cookies, as it undermined the whole idea of the evening.

I just thought I was being nice and adding something sweet, but now I'm wondering if I really was disrespectful. Am I the asshole for bringing cookies to a healthy dinner party?",62,2281,0.53,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_22558,2018-09-22 00:00:00,YTA,1710,AITA

When she sent out the invites, she asked everyone to keep the celebration small and intimate, mainly to avoid drama with her family. 

I’ve been dealing with some personal issues lately and thought it would be a good idea to throw a surprise party for her right after the baby shower. I told a few of our mutual friends about my plan, and they were all on board. I figured it would be a nice way to celebrate her new journey and lift her spirits since she’s been stressed.

The problem is, I didn’t consult her about it. I just assumed she would love the idea of an additional party. My plan was to gather everyone at my place after the shower and celebrate her with cake and decorations. I even went ahead and made a Facebook event to get everyone together.

When my friend found out about the surprise party, she was upset. She told me that she felt overwhelmed and that the last thing she needed was another event on top of the baby shower. I tried to explain that I was just trying to do something nice for her, but she said it felt like I was disregarding her feelings and wishes. 

Now, I feel bad because I genuinely wanted to celebrate her, but I didn’t consider her perspective at all.

I recently hosted a small gathering for a few friends at my apartment. Among them was my friend Sarah, who has been struggling with her mental health and has been open about her journey with anxiety and depression. I wanted to create a fun atmosphere, so I decided to play a few party games to lighten the mood.

At one point, we played a game where we shared embarrassing stories. When it was Sarah's turn, she started to tell a story about a difficult moment in her life related to her mental health struggles. Instead of being supportive, I thought it would be funny to interrupt her with a joke about how we all have our ""crazy"" moments. I laughed and said something like, “At least you’re not as crazy as that time I thought my cat was secretly plotting against me!” I thought it would lighten the mood, but Sarah went silent, and it was clear she was hurt.

After the game, I noticed that she seemed really upset and distanced herself from the group. I later found out that she left the gathering early and texted me that she felt I didn’t take her seriously and that my joke made her feel invalidated. I responded that I was just trying to be funny and that she needed to lighten up. I thought my intention was harmless and that I was just trying to create a fun environment.

Now, some of my other friends are saying that I should have been more sensitive to Sarah's feelings and that my joke was out of line. I still feel like I was just trying to keep things light and fun, but I’m starting to wonder if maybe I crossed a line.

We grew up in a family where grades and achievements were highly valued, and this competitive spirit has stuck with me into adulthood. My brother and I have a great relationship for the most part, but there have been moments where my competitiveness has caused some tension.

Recently, my brother won a prestigious award at his job that he had been aiming for, and I was genuinely proud of him. However, I couldn’t help but feel a twinge of jealousy since I had been working towards a similar achievement in my own career. Instead of expressing my support openly, I made a passive-aggressive comment at a family gathering about how ""nice"" it must be to get recognition for something ""so simple."" I said it in front of our parents and some family friends, and I thought it was a joking remark. 

My brother was visibly hurt, and my parents looked uncomfortable. I brushed it off, thinking he would get over it. But later that evening, he confronted me privately and told me that my comment made him feel belittled and that he didn’t deserve that after all his hard work. I was taken aback; I thought it was just sibling banter. I ended up getting defensive and told him he was being too sensitive and that if he couldn’t handle a little teasing, then maybe he didn’t deserve the award after all.

My brother has always been sensitive about his achievements, and I guess I was too caught up in my own feelings to see how my words affected him.

Recently, my friend Jess bought a brand-new gaming console. She was super excited about it and had been saving up for a while. I was happy for her, but I wasn’t particularly interested in gaming myself. One day, I was over at her place, and while she was in the kitchen, I decided to take a quick look at her console. I had my phone on me, and I thought it would be harmless to play a quick game or two while I waited for her.

Jess walked back in and caught me playing her console without asking. She didn’t look happy and told me I should’ve asked first. I brushed it off and told her it was just a game and that I could always delete my save data. To me, it didn’t seem like a big deal since we share so much. Plus, I was having fun and thought she wouldn’t mind.

Later, I found out she was really upset about it. She told me she felt disrespected because she put a lot of money and effort into that console, and I should have asked before just jumping in. I argued that I was only playing for a little while and that it wasn’t a big issue. I even pointed out how we’ve shared things in the past, so why was this any different?

However, he ended up following me around, wanting to do everything I was doing, but he kept asking if I could cover his costs for activities and meals. I didn’t mind treating him to a few things at first, but it quickly became apparent he was expecting me to foot the bill for most of the trip.

I have a bit of a reputation in the family for being the “fun uncle,” so I decided to bring a piñata filled with candy for the kids to enjoy. We set it up in the backyard and all the kids were super excited.

However, when the time came for the kids to take their swings at the piñata, I purposely made it a bit too high for them to reach easily. I thought it would be hilarious to watch them struggle a little bit and see their reactions. But after several attempts, they started getting frustrated. I laughed it off, thinking it was all in good fun.

Eventually, one of the parents, my sister-in-law, came over and asked me to lower it so the kids could actually hit it. I rolled my eyes and said, “Come on, it’s supposed to be a challenge! They’ll learn to persevere.” She got annoyed and told me that it’s just a birthday party for kids, and they should be able to actually hit the piñata.

I didn’t think I was being unreasonable; I just wanted to make it more entertaining. But after a bit of back and forth, I finally gave in and lowered it. The kids ended up having a blast once they could reach it, but I still felt like I was right for trying to make it more exciting.

Now I’m wondering if I was too harsh or if I just misunderstood the spirit of the gathering. AITA for trying to add a little fun to the party?",339,905,0.59,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_19497,2021-05-19 00:00:00,YTA,1429,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I was at a coffee shop waiting for my order when I noticed a woman at the counter struggle to place her order. She seemed a bit flustered and took way too long to decide what she wanted. The line behind her was growing, and I could tell people were getting irritated. I was already running late for work, and I just couldn't hold my frustration in.

When she finally placed her order, I loudly said, ""Some of us have places to be, you know!"" I thought it would be a funny comment, but the woman looked visibly upset. She quickly paid and rushed to the side to wait for her drink, avoiding eye contact with anyone. 

As I waited for my own order, I overheard her talking to the barista about how she was just trying to treat herself after a tough week. I felt a twinge of guilt but brushed it off, thinking that people should be more considerate of others in busy places like that.

When I got my drink, I couldn't help but mention to the barista that they should maybe limit the time customers can take at the counter during rush hours. The barista seemed a bit taken aback but nodded.

Later, my friend told me I was too harsh on the woman. She said that everyone has bad days and that I should have shown some empathy instead of making a scene.

Recently, I found out that she’s been texting one of her exes, who I know she had a rocky breakup with. I was feeling really uneasy about it, so I decided to check her phone while she was in the shower. I know it was wrong, but I wanted to see what they were talking about. I saw messages that were flirty and suggested they might be hanging out.

When she got out of the shower, I confronted her about it. I told her I felt betrayed and insecure, and that she should have told me she was still in contact with him. She got defensive and said that it was just friendly and that she didn’t think it was a big deal since she was happy with me. 

Instead of trying to understand her perspective, I ended up yelling at her and calling her names. I told her she was being disrespectful and that if she wanted to talk to him, maybe she should just be with him instead of me. She ended up crying, and I felt terrible, but at the same time, I was just so angry and hurt.

Now she’s taking some time apart to think about things, and I feel like I might have pushed her away for good.

My best friend, Jamie, has been dating this guy, Mark, for about six months. We all get along really well, and I thought it would be hilarious to prank them a bit. Jamie has this ridiculous fear of clowns, and I knew Mark was planning a surprise birthday party for her. I thought it would be funny to dress up as a clown and crash the party just before everyone surprised her.

The day of the party, I got all decked out in a full clown costume—wig, makeup, the whole shebang. I even brought a fake pie to throw at her as a gag. When I arrived at the party, everyone was in on the joke, and they were excited to see Jamie's reaction.

When they finally shouted ""Surprise!"" and Jamie walked in, she froze. Her face went pale, and she just started screaming. I thought she was playing along, but it quickly became clear that she was genuinely terrified. Mark rushed to her, trying to calm her down, but she was completely panicking. I didn’t realize how serious her fear was until I saw her almost in tears, shaking.

I thought it would be funny to take off the clown wig and reveal myself, but that only made things worse. Jamie ran out of the room, crying, and Mark was furious with me. He told me I needed to leave and that I had ruined the party. I tried to apologize, but Jamie didn't want to talk to me, and Mark told me I was an idiot for not considering how much she hated clowns.

Well, one of my friends, let's call him Jake, is notoriously late to everything. I told everyone to arrive at 7 PM, and I made it clear that we would start eating right at 7:30. I know it sounds strict, but my cooking really doesn't hold up well if it sits too long. 

So, 7:30 rolls around, and Jake still isn't there. The rest of my friends are getting hungry, and I'm starting to feel anxious about the food. Finally, at 7:45, I get a text from Jake saying he's running late and will be there in about 15 minutes. 

I was frustrated, so I decided to tell everyone to start eating without him. I figured if we waited for him, the pasta would be a soggy mess. We all dug in, and I felt a bit guilty but justified about it. 

When Jake finally arrived at 8 PM, he walked in, saw us all eating, and looked really upset. He said he was looking forward to the food and felt excluded. I didn't really think I did anything wrong because, honestly, I was just trying to save the meal.

So I (25M) have a friend, Jake (26M), who recently got a new girlfriend, Sarah (24F). They’ve been dating for about three months. I’ve known Jake for years, and he has been through some rough relationships, so I was really happy for him. However, I noticed that Sarah has been coming to our hangouts more often, and I felt a bit sidelined.

Last weekend, we all went out to a bar together. During the night, I started making some jokes about Jake and his dating history, thinking it was all in good fun and that Sarah would appreciate my humor. I said things like, “At least she doesn’t have to deal with your exes anymore; I’m sure they’re all relieved!” and “Just remember, if you ever need to bail on a date, just say you’re hanging out with me!” My intention was to be playful and keep the vibe light, but I noticed that Sarah didn’t laugh much and seemed a bit uncomfortable.

At one point, Jake pulled me aside and said, “Hey man, can you cool it with the jokes? I don’t want to make Sarah feel bad.” I shrugged it off and said I was just joking, but he seemed serious. I went back to the table and kept making light-hearted digs at Jake, thinking it would bring us all closer together. I even joked, “With your dating track record, I’m surprised you haven’t scared her off yet!” 

After a while, Sarah looked visibly upset and eventually left the table, saying she needed to go to the restroom. Jake followed her, looking frustrated. When they came back, the mood had shifted, and I could tell things were tense. I tried to lighten the mood again, but Jake just told me to stop.

Later that night, I texted Jake to apologize, but he didn’t respond right away. The next day, he called and told me that Sarah didn’t appreciate my jokes and that I really crossed a line. I didn’t understand why he was taking it so seriously and told him he was overreacting. I thought friends could joke with each other without it being a big deal.

However, when she shared her business plan with me, I couldn't help but feel like it was unrealistic. I mean, she has no experience in running a business at all, and I told her that I thought she was setting herself up for failure. I also pointed out that the market she was looking to enter is super competitive and that she would be better off getting a regular job instead of risking her savings.

I could tell she was disappointed by my response, but instead of just letting it go, I kept pushing my point. I told her that her idea was naive and that she should really reconsider. I ended up suggesting that she do a bunch of research and maybe even take some classes before jumping in. To be honest, I was worried she would lose a lot of money and be crushed if it didn't work out.

In the heat of the moment, I said some things that might have come off as harsh, like calling her dream a “pipe dream” and telling her that she was wasting her time. She got really upset and said that I was being unsupportive and that she just wanted someone to believe in her. I didn’t back down though; I thought I was just being realistic.

My cousin was getting married, and I was excited to attend the wedding. I’ve always had a somewhat competitive relationship with her because she’s a successful lawyer, and I’m still figuring out my career. So, naturally, I wanted to look my best at the wedding.

You're the Asshole,"**Backstory**

My cousin, who is 12, has been living with my uncle and aunt since his parents split up. They both work long hours, and since my cousin has always been a bit of a troublemaker, they let him have a lot of freedom in the hopes that he would just settle down. However, it seems to have backfired.

**SCHOOL AND HOME BEHAVIOR**

At school, he's constantly getting in trouble for being disruptive. He rarely does his homework and often tries to convince other kids to skip class with him. My uncle and aunt are aware of this but have a ""boys will be boys"" mentality, believing he’s just being a typical kid. They’ve had multiple meetings with his teachers, but my cousin just charms his way out of consequences, and they don’t follow through on discipline at home.

**THE FAMILY GATHERING**

Last weekend, we had a family gathering, and my cousin was especially rowdy. He kept throwing food and making loud jokes that were inappropriate for the setting. I tried to talk to him about it, telling him it was disrespectful to the adults present and that he could be fun without being obnoxious. Instead of listening, he just laughed and continued his antics, which embarrassed me in front of the family.

**MY REACTION**

When I finally had enough, I snapped at him, saying that if he couldn’t act like a decent human being, he should just go home. I felt justified because his behavior was ruining the gathering for everyone. My uncle and aunt overheard me and came to his defense, saying I was being too harsh and that he was just trying to have fun. I argued back that it wasn’t fun for anyone else and that they needed to step up and parent him better.

**WIBTA?**

I feel bad now for how I handled it. Maybe I could have just let it go or found a better way to talk to him, but I was just so frustrated by their lack of discipline. I’m torn because I want to help him, but I also don’t want to be the bad guy. Was I wrong to confront him like that?",514,1141,0.65,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_39681,2020-11-23 00:00:00,YTA,1960,AITA

However, when he told me about it, I had some reservations.

You're the Asshole,"I recently attended a friend's birthday party at a popular restaurant. It was a large group, with about 15 people, but the restaurant was busy and we had to wait for a table. While waiting, I was feeling a bit impatient and decided to step outside for a breather. I figured I’d be back quickly to join the group once we were seated.

While I was outside, I noticed a couple of people sitting at a nearby bench. They were engaged in conversation, and I realized they were waiting for a table too. Instead of returning inside right away, I struck up a conversation with them, thinking it would be a nice way to pass the time.

After about 30 minutes, I got a text from my friend saying that they had finally been seated. When I walked back in, I saw that our table was pretty cramped and others were now waiting. I walked right up to the table, plopped down, and started chatting and eating as if I hadn’t just made them wait even longer.

Some of my friends were clearly annoyed that I hadn’t been there when they were seated, and one of them even told me that it would have been nice if I had come back sooner since they were trying to keep the table occupied for everyone. I brushed it off and told them it was their fault for not waiting for me. I thought they were being dramatic since I had no intention of missing out on the food and fun just because they were impatient.

You're the Asshole,"My friend Jake recently got engaged to his girlfriend, and he asked me to be his best man. I was really excited for him, but as the wedding planning started, I noticed that Jake’s fiancée, Sarah, was really controlling about everything. She wanted things done her way and often dismissed Jake's opinions, which honestly annoyed me.

As they were planning the bachelor party, I offered to organize it. I wanted to make it a weekend trip to a fun city, but Sarah insisted that it be a simple dinner and drinks at a local restaurant. I thought that was lame, but I didn't want to cause any drama, so I reluctantly agreed. However, I decided to go behind their backs and plan a surprise weekend trip anyway. I told Jake about it, and he was thrilled, which made me feel justified.

When I revealed the plans to Sarah, she was furious. She called me selfish and said I was trying to undermine her authority in their relationship. I just shrugged it off, thinking she was overreacting. I went ahead with the trip, and Jake had a great time, but Sarah was really upset and refused to talk to me for weeks after.

At the wedding, she gave a speech that hinted at her displeasure with me, and I felt uncomfortable. I know I shouldn't have gone against her wishes, but in my mind, I was just trying to give Jake a memorable experience.

You're the Asshole,"Okay, so I (25F) recently got invited to my best friend’s (26F) wedding. She’s been planning this day for over a year, and I was really excited for her. However, she’s always been a bit of a perfectionist, and I know she has some pretty specific ideas about how she wants things to go.

A few weeks ago, she asked me to be a bridesmaid, and of course, I said yes. I thought it would be fun, and I wanted to support her. But then she started sending me ideas for dresses, and honestly, I didn’t like any of them. They were all super formal and expensive, and I felt uncomfortable in that style.

So, last week, I went shopping with some friends and found a dress that I really loved. It’s a little more casual and definitely less expensive than what she suggested, but I felt so confident in it. I decided to wear it to the wedding without consulting her first because I thought she would just be happy I found something I liked.

When I showed her the dress last night, she completely flipped out. She said it didn’t match her wedding theme and that I was ruining the aesthetic she wanted for her big day. I tried to explain how much I loved the dress and that it made me feel good, but she wouldn’t listen. She even suggested that if I didn’t want to wear one of the dresses she picked, maybe I shouldn’t be a bridesmaid at all.

I ended up telling her that she was being unreasonable and that it was my body and my choice. I thought I was standing up for myself, but now I’m starting to wonder if I overstepped.

A few weeks ago, my brother shared the wedding colors they chose—navy blue and gold. I immediately told him that I had a beautiful navy blue dress hanging in my closet that I've been saving for a special occasion. I mentioned how I was excited to wear it to their wedding, feeling it would be a great fit.

However, my brother seemed a bit off after I said that. Later, he pulled me aside and asked if I could consider not wearing the navy dress because he wanted the color to be exclusive for the wedding party. I brushed him off, saying it was just a color and that I should be able to wear whatever I want.

When I received the invitation, I decided to post a picture of the dress on social media, tagging my brother and his fiancé. My brother texted me privately, asking me again if I could choose something else, as it would mean a lot to him if I did. I was irritated and snapped back that it was just a color and people wear navy blue all the time. 

He ended up telling me that if I wore the dress, it would just be embarrassing for him and might upset his fiancée.

So, a bit of background: My sister and I have always had a rocky relationship. She's four years younger than me and has always looked up to me, but I can be pretty critical. I tend to hold high standards, and I guess I've unintentionally made her feel inadequate over the years. We recently had a family gathering where she revealed that she's been struggling with her mental health and has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression.

During the gathering, she mentioned that she was trying to start a small business selling handmade jewelry, which is something she's passionate about. I didn't mean to sound harsh, but I couldn't help but voice my concerns about her plans. I told her that starting a business was a big commitment and that she should be practical about her expectations. I suggested she should focus on getting a stable job first before diving into entrepreneurship, especially since she’s been struggling with her mental health.

I thought I was being realistic and looking out for her best interests, but the way she reacted made me rethink my approach. She ended up getting really upset and accused me of not believing in her. I honestly didn't mean to come off that way; I just wanted her to be cautious. My family ended up siding with her, saying that I was being too critical and should support her dreams instead of criticizing her. 

After that, I feel like there's been this tension between us. I still believe I was trying to help her avoid potential disappointment, but now I'm questioning whether I crossed a line.

He has always struggled with his writing and has a hard time organizing his thoughts, so I agreed to help him out. I thought it would be a good bonding experience, and I also wanted to support him in doing well in school.

When we sat down to work on it, I quickly realized that he was way behind on the requirements. He hadn’t even started the research, and the project was due in just a few days. I got frustrated because I felt like he didn’t take it seriously. Instead of encouraging him to work on it, I ended up writing most of the paper myself and just included his name on it. I thought it was the only way he would get a decent grade.

After he turned it in, I felt a bit guilty but didn’t think too much of it. However, I found out that he got a high grade on the project, and now he’s bragging about it to his friends.

You're the Asshole,"My friends and I have a long-standing tradition of going out for dinner every Friday night. We typically try new places and split the bill equally, which I think is fair since we all enjoy different cuisines and experiences. However, recently, I've started to feel like some of my friends have been taking advantage of this arrangement, particularly one friend, Sarah.

Sarah has a pretty decent job and can generally afford nicer meals, but she often opts for the most expensive items on the menu. Last week, for instance, she ordered a steak that was nearly $40, while I got a salad and a drink for around $15. When the bill came, I was shocked to see that I ended up paying a larger share than I usually do, all because Sarah decided to splurge on her meal.

After that night, I decided I needed to say something, so I brought it up in our group chat. I suggested that we should maybe start ordering individual checks to make it more fair, especially since Sarah seems to consistently get the priciest dishes. I thought this would help alleviate any tension and make it clear that we all need to be more mindful of each other’s budgets.

Sarah responded by saying that it was just a dinner and that I shouldn’t be so uptight about it. She claimed that if she wanted to treat herself, she should be able to without feeling guilty. I felt a little hurt by her response and ended up insisting that we should stick to the group check method but perhaps agree on a maximum limit for meals. 

Now, some of my friends are upset with me for making things awkward, saying that dining out should be about enjoying each other's company and not about splitting costs down to the last cent. They think I’m being petty and that it shouldn’t matter if someone spends more occasionally because we’re all friends.

As we sat down, I noticed that a couple of my friends looked a bit uncomfortable when they saw the Hawaiian pizza.

However, during the meal, she made a comment about my career choice. I work in a field that isn’t considered prestigious, and she’s always been dismissive about it.

I felt embarrassed, and instead of brushing it off, I snapped at her in front of our family, calling her a snob and saying she only cares about money and status. The dinner went silent, and my parents looked shocked. My sister got really upset and left the table in tears.

Afterwards, my parents said I overreacted and should apologize. I thought I was just standing up for myself, but now I’m wondering if I went too far. It’s been a couple of days, and I still haven’t reached out to her because I feel justified in my anger, but I also feel bad for how she reacted.

Edit: I know I should have handled it better, but I’m tired of her constantly belittling my choices. I thought this was a step in standing up for myself.",660,1918,0.67,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_19489,2018-01-09 00:00:00,YTA,1116,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I (32f) have a younger brother ""Jake"" (22m) who has been living with me since he graduated college a year ago. Jake is a great guy, but he has a tendency to be a bit messy and disorganized, which drives me crazy because I'm a neat freak.

Recently, Jake started dating ""Sara"" (21f), and they've been spending a lot of time together at my place. I don’t mind them hanging out, but I do want to maintain some boundaries. I work from home and my space is very important to me for concentration.

One weekend, I came home from a long week of meetings and was looking forward to some quiet time. Instead, I found my living room turned into a mini-party zone with snacks everywhere, music blaring, and my furniture rearranged. Jake and Sara were there with a couple of their friends, just having a good time. I felt really frustrated because I hadn’t been consulted about it at all.

I snapped at Jake, telling him he needed to get his friends out of my house and to clean up the mess. I called him inconsiderate and said I didn't want his chaotic lifestyle invading my home. He tried to argue that he was just trying to have fun and that I was being uptight, but I was too angry to listen. I ended up kicking everyone out and told him he needed to find another place to live if he couldn't respect my space.

After they left, I realized I might have overreacted, especially since it was just a gathering and not a huge party. However, I felt justified in wanting my home to be a peaceful environment. Jake is really upset with me and feels unwelcome in my home now. Our relationship is strained, and I’m starting to wonder if I went too far.

So, Reddit, AITA for kicking my brother and his friends out of my house for being too messy and loud?",899,2414,0.51,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_19708,2023-09-17 00:00:00,YTA,1739,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I (28M) have a younger sister (24F) who recently graduated from college and moved back home to save money while she looks for a job. Our parents are supportive and have been letting her stay rent-free, which I think is a good idea given her situation. However, I’ve been really frustrated with her lately.

Since she moved back in, she’s taken over the living room, leaving her clothes and personal items scattered everywhere. I’ve tried to politely ask her to keep her things in her room, but she just brushes it off, saying it’s more comfortable to have her stuff around while she studies and applies for jobs. I feel like I can’t even relax in my own home anymore because it looks like a mess.

The other day, I got really fed up and decided to take matters into my own hands. I went into her room while she was out and moved a bunch of her things back into her room, and even threw out some old food that was left in the living room. I sent her a text saying that I cleaned up and that it’s time for her to be more responsible about her space, especially since I’m still paying the bills.

When she came home, she was really upset. She told me that I had no right to go through her things and that it was unfair for me to decide what should be kept or thrown away. I tried to explain that I did it because I care about our living environment, but she said I made her feel unwelcome in her own home.

Now I’m feeling guilty about how I handled it. I thought I was being reasonable, but maybe I overstepped by invading her space and making decisions for her.

You're the Asshole,"I’ll keep this brief. My girlfriend and I have been together for about a year, and I recently started a new job that requires a lot of my time and energy. She’s been super supportive, but I feel like she’s been leaning on me a bit too much emotionally lately. 

Last week, she had a bad day and wanted to talk about it. I was exhausted after a long shift, but I didn’t want to be cold, so I listened to her vent for over an hour. Throughout the conversation, I kept checking my phone because I had some work issues I needed to attend to. Eventually, I snapped and told her that she needed to “get over it” because I didn’t have time for her drama right now. I could tell she was hurt, and the call ended awkwardly.

Later, she texted me saying how upset she was and that she felt like I didn’t care about her feelings. I brushed it off, saying she was being overly dramatic and that she should find someone else to vent to if I wasn't good enough.

You're the Asshole,"I (27F) have a younger sister, Emily (20F), who has recently become very passionate about making sustainable lifestyle choices. She’s been trying to eat plant-based, reduce single-use plastics, and promote eco-friendly products. While I admire her dedication, I find it a bit extreme at times.

Last week, I hosted a small dinner party for some friends, and I decided to make a big pasta dish with garlic bread and a fresh salad. I was excited to share a meal together and didn’t think much of it. I used regular pasta, some cheese for the garlic bread, and a dressing with honey in the salad. Emily showed up unexpectedly and immediately criticized my meal choices, saying it was all incredibly wasteful and unhealthy. She suggested I should have made everything plant-based and used reusable containers for serving.

I felt embarrassed and defensive in front of my friends. I told her that I’d made the meal with love and that it was rude to criticize it. I said I could understand her passion, but she shouldn’t impose her views on everyone else, especially during my event. Afterward, I continued with the dinner, but I noticed some tension in the air.

Later, Emily told me that I was being inconsiderate and making her feel bad about her choices. I was frustrated and told her that she was being dramatic and should just lighten up. Now, I'm wondering if I was too harsh. So, AITA for not accommodating Emily's lifestyle choices at my own dinner party?",81,2886,0.64,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_11841,2019-10-02 00:00:00,YTA,1458,AITA
You're the Asshole,"Last week, I had a small gathering at my house to celebrate my birthday. I invited a few close friends, and we had a nice time eating cake and chatting. One of my friends, Sarah, has been going through a tough time lately, and I thought it would be nice to include her in the celebration.

During the party, I decided to open my gifts in front of everyone. I received some lovely presents, but when it came to the gift from Sarah, I could tell she was a bit nervous. I opened it and found a handmade bracelet. It wasn’t really my style, and I didn’t love it, but instead of being polite, I made a face and said, “Oh... thanks, but I’m not really into this kind of jewelry.” 

I could see Sarah’s face fall, and she tried to laugh it off, but it was clear she was hurt. I quickly moved on to the next gift, but I felt the mood shift in the room. A couple of my other friends even shot me disapproving looks.

Later, I overheard some of my friends discussing how rude I was being to Sarah. I brushed it off, thinking they were overreacting. It was just an honest opinion, right? I’ve since seen Sarah a couple of times, and I haven't brought it up because I don’t want to make it awkward, but I keep wondering if I was out of line for my reaction.

You're the Asshole,"My friend invited me to her wedding, and I was really excited. I've known her for years, and I was honored to be part of her special day. However, as the wedding date approached, I found out that she was planning to have a very small ceremony with only immediate family and a few close friends. I felt a bit hurt that I wasn't included in that intimate circle, but I understood her desire for something more personal during such a chaotic time.

A few weeks later, I was scrolling through social media and saw that she posted her wedding photos. I felt a surge of jealousy because she looked so happy, and I wasn't there to celebrate with her. In a moment of impulse, I decided to make a post on my own page, sharing how disappointed I was not to be invited and how I thought it was unfair to exclude friends. I even tagged her in the post, hoping she would see how I felt.

She reached out to me privately, understandably upset. She expressed that she wanted to keep the ceremony small and that it wasn't personal against anyone, including me. I brushed off her concerns, telling her she was being too sensitive and that I was just expressing my feelings. I didn't apologize, and instead, I doubled down, saying that she should have considered her friends more when planning the wedding.

Now, some mutual friends are caught in the middle, and I feel guilty about how it all turned out. A few of them think I was rude, while others agree with my feelings. I don't know if I overstepped, but I honestly just wanted her to know how I felt.

She's really into him, and while I haven't had many interactions with him, I always try to be polite.

Last month, my sister invited me to a family dinner at her place, and she definitely wanted me to bond with her boyfriend. During the dinner, he kept calling me “dude” and joking around, which just rubbed me the wrong way. I finally snapped and told him that I don’t appreciate being called “dude” and that it feels disrespectful coming from him.

My sister was visibly upset and said I was ruining the evening. I felt justified because I wanted him to understand that I deserve respect too. After that, I ended up leaving the dinner early, and my sister texted me later, expressing how disappointed she was in my reaction.

I’ve been thinking it over and I might be in the wrong here. I could’ve chosen a better way to express my feelings about the nickname without making a scene. I also didn’t consider how my outburst could affect my sister’s relationship or her feelings.

While everyone was helping her set up, I noticed a few dishes of food that I didn't think were very appetizing. One of them was a casserole that looked like it had been sitting out for too long. 

Feeling a bit snarky and wanting to lighten the mood, I made a loud joke about how the casserole looked like it could double as a science project instead of dinner. A few family members laughed, and I thought I was being funny. However, my sister's face fell, and I could see she was upset. 

Instead of apologizing, I continued to make jokes, thinking I was helping to ease her stress. I even went so far as to say that maybe we should all just order pizza instead of eating her ""mystery casserole."" This only made her more upset, and eventually, she just walked away, leaving me feeling a bit conflicted.

Later that evening, when I realized my sister was still upset and avoiding me, I finally started to reflect on my behavior. I thought I was just trying to be funny, but I could see now that I had really hurt her feelings. When I tried to talk to her about it, she expressed how much effort she had put into the food and how my comments made her feel unappreciated.

You're the Asshole,"A few weeks ago, I was asked by a close friend to help him with his wedding planning. He was overwhelmed and really needed someone to step in and help him organize things. I agreed to assist him, and I was excited to be a part of his big day.

As we got closer to the wedding date, my friend told me that he would need to be more hands-on with his family’s business, which meant he would have less time to focus on the wedding. I told him I could take over a lot of the planning, and he seemed relieved. 

With only a week left before the wedding, I was really deep into the planning. I spent hours researching venues, catering options, and decorations. I also coordinated with vendors and managed the guest list. I felt like I was doing a great job, and my friend seemed to appreciate my efforts.

However, during this time, I also received a ticket to a concert that I had been dying to see. It was on the same weekend as the wedding, and I really wanted to go. I figured I had already done enough planning, so I told my friend that I would be leaving for the concert on Friday and wouldn't be back until Sunday.

When I told him this, he was shocked and upset. He said that he was counting on me to be there for support and help with last-minute details on the day of the wedding. I brushed it off and told him he would be fine without me. I even said that he should just enjoy the day and not worry about anything because I had everything under control.

I went to the concert, had an amazing time, and when I returned, I found out that the wedding had been a disaster without me there. There were issues with the catering, the decorations weren’t set up correctly, and my friend was stressed out to the max. He ended up getting into a fight with his family because they didn’t know what to do without my help.

Recently, one of my coworkers, Sarah, had her birthday, and we decided to throw a surprise party for her in the break room. I was really excited about it and took the lead in organizing everything, including getting a cake, decorations, and a card for everyone to sign.

The day of the party, I noticed that Sarah had brought her new boyfriend, Mike. I had never met him before, but I heard he was a bit of a jokester. As we were all singing “Happy Birthday,” I thought it would be funny to add some humor to the situation. So, when it came time for her to blow out the candles, I jokingly yelled, “Blow hard! Or else the candles will keep burning forever!” 

Instead of laughing, everyone fell quiet, and Mike shot me an annoyed look. I brushed it off, thinking they were just being sensitive. After Sarah blew out the candles, I decided to keep the joke going. I said something like, “Don’t worry, Sarah! If you miss one, I’ll just help you light it again and make a wish next year!” At that point, Sarah looked pretty upset.

Recently, we celebrated her birthday, and I wanted to do something special for her. She loves photography and has been talking about getting a new camera for a while, but they can be quite expensive. So, I decided to surprise her with a really nice camera I knew she'd love.

I spent a lot of time researching and found the perfect model. It wasn’t cheap, but I felt it was worth it to see her happy. On her birthday, I presented her with the camera, and she was thrilled at first. However, after a few minutes, she started to look a bit uneasy.

She eventually told me that while she appreciated the gesture, she had been saving up for a different camera model that was less expensive and more suitable for her current photography needs. She explained that she wanted to be more practical and was worried about how this expensive gift didn’t align with her budget goals.

Instead of being understanding, I got defensive. I told her that she was being ungrateful and that I spent a lot of time and effort picking out something I thought would make her happy. I also mentioned that she could just sell the camera if she didn’t want it. I insisted it was a great gift, and I felt like she was undermining my gesture because it wasn’t what she wanted.

During the reception, I got a bit tipsy and started feeling emotional about my own situation. I ended up telling a few people at my table about the family problems I was dealing with, which included some pretty sensitive topics. I didn’t mean to, but I was looking for sympathy and support.

At some point, I noticed some guests near the head table looking over at me and whispering. I guess I was being a bit loud, but I felt like I was just sharing my feelings in a moment of celebration.

Recently, he has been talking about wanting to get into better shape and has started going to the gym regularly. I think it's great that he's focusing on his health, but I’m starting to feel left out.

At first, he was really excited about it and invited me to join him. I went a few times, but I quickly realized that I really don’t enjoy working out. I find it boring and tedious, and I would much rather spend that time doing something fun together, like going for a hike or playing a sport.

He started going to the gym almost every day and seems to be enjoying it more without me. I’ve said multiple times that I’m not really into fitness and would prefer to spend our time together doing something else, but he keeps insisting that I should join him. He even suggested that I should go to the gym by myself while he works out, and I just feel like he’s prioritizing his fitness over our time together.

I got frustrated and told him that I think he's being selfish for wanting me to go along with this when I clearly don't enjoy it. I also told him that I feel like he’s more interested in his gym routine than in our relationship. He was really hurt by what I said, and now he's feeling like he has to choose between his fitness goals and our relationship.

However, I also have some personal issues with her management style. She tends to micromanage and doesn't really allow for any creative input from the team, which has been frustrating for us.

Last week, we had a team meeting where Emily presented a new project and asked for our input. I didn’t like her idea and felt it wouldn’t work, so I voiced my concerns, explaining why I thought we should take a different approach. Instead of considering my feedback, she shot me down in front of everyone, saying that she had a clear vision and didn’t want to deviate from it. I felt embarrassed and undermined.

I didn’t think anyone would take it seriously, but it turns out one of the coworkers I confided in shared my comments with others in the office, and now it’s become a bit of a gossip topic.

Today, Emily approached me and mentioned that she heard about my comments. She was hurt and said that it’s not the kind of support she expected from a coworker.

You're the Asshole,"Ok, some background before I get into it. On mobile, sorry for any typos!

Cast: 
Me = me...
Best Friend = BF
BF's Partner = P
Their Child = C (age 5)

I've been best friends with BF for over a decade. We share everything, from secrets to celebrations. I’ve always been the fun friend who loves to throw spontaneous parties and enjoy life to its fullest. BF and P had a child, C, about five years ago. While I adore C and have a good relationship with them, I’ve often found it a bit challenging to interact with a child during adult events.

Recently, I decided to throw an adults-only party at my house to celebrate my promotion at work. I specifically mentioned in the invitations that it was an adult gathering and that no kids were allowed. I thought this would give everyone a chance to relax and have fun without worrying about kids running around.

When BF RSVP’d, I was excited but a bit apprehensive as I remembered how much fun they had at my last party. However, when the day of the party came, BF showed up with C in tow. I was taken aback and told them that I understood they might have wanted to come as a family, but I had made it clear that this was an adults-only event. BF argued that they didn’t have anyone to watch C and felt it was unfair to miss out on the celebration. I insisted they take C home or find a babysitter because I wasn’t comfortable with kids being there.

Things escalated when I told them they could either leave with C or I would have to ask them to leave the party. Eventually, BF decided to stay but left C outside with a babysitter they found at the last minute, which made me feel guilty. I didn’t want to ruin our friendship, but I really wanted to enjoy the party without any interruptions.

After the party, BF was upset and told me that I could have handled the situation better. While I felt justified in wanting an adults-only event, I did take it too far by pushing them to leave or find alternative childcare on such short notice.

WIBTA for wanting my party to be strictly adults-only?

But for some reason, I just couldn’t hold back my thoughts. I told her that I think it’s a bad idea and that she should really consider going to a hospital instead, for safety reasons. I even brought up some horror stories I’ve heard about home births gone wrong—like how complications can happen unexpectedly.

I saw my sister's face drop. She looked really hurt, but I kept going, insisting that she would be putting herself and the baby at risk. I told her, ""You don’t want to be one of those people who regrets their decision later."" She finally walked away from the conversation, and I could tell she was upset.

Later, my mom came to me and said I should have been more supportive. She said that my sister was looking forward to this experience and I shouldn’t have tried to control her choices. I felt like I was just being realistic, but now I’m starting to think I may have overstepped. I really didn't mean to hurt her, but I was just trying to look out for her and the baby.

You're the Asshole,"Hi everyone! I’m in a bit of a dilemma and I could use some outside perspective.

So, I (28F) just recently got promoted at work, and my boss is taking the whole team on a retreat to a really nice resort for a week. This is a huge opportunity for me, especially since I’ve been working really hard to earn this promotion. However, I have a 2-year-old son and my husband (30M) works really long hours, so he can’t take time off to watch our son while I’m away.

I’ve been trying to figure out how to make this work, and I thought it would be a great idea to ask my parents to come stay with us for that week to help out. They live a few hours away and usually don’t get to see their grandson much since they’re busy with work, but I thought this would be a good chance for them to bond. However, my parents have a strict rule that they don’t babysit unless it’s an emergency, and they made it clear they don’t want to be “on the clock” as sitters.

I was feeling frustrated, and I decided to push back a little. I told them that I really need their help and that it would mean a lot to me if they could just put their plans on hold for a week. I even offered to pay them for their time, but they still refused, saying that they want to enjoy their time with their grandson, not feel like they’re working.

In the heat of the moment, I snapped and said that if they really cared about me and their grandson, they would be willing to help out. I told them that it’s not fair for them to prioritize their own plans over my career advancement. Now, they're really hurt and I'm starting to think I might have crossed a line.

So, AITA for pressuring my parents to babysit for me while I go on this work retreat?",418,1622,0.73,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_18351,2024-01-01 00:00:00,YTA,1705,AITA

Recently, my friend got engaged to her long-time boyfriend, and I was thrilled for her. However, her wedding is in a few months, and I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed by the planning process.

I secretly thought about how I could make the wedding more about me. I’ve always dreamed of being the center of attention, and I thought that maybe I could use her wedding as a moment to shine. So, I decided to surprise her by planning a “big reveal” for my own engagement at her wedding. My boyfriend and I had been dating for a while, and while we hadn’t officially gotten engaged yet, I figured it would be the perfect time to announce it.

When the day came, I organized with my boyfriend to get down on one knee right after my friend said her vows. I thought it would be a beautiful moment for both of us. However, when I did it, my friend was visibly upset. The guests were confused, and it completely took the spotlight away from her special day. She ended up having to deal with my announcement instead of enjoying her moment.

After the wedding, she told me that I had ruined her day and that I should have respected her wedding as her day, not mine. Our mutual friends are also upset with me, saying that it was selfish of me to make her wedding about my engagement.

You're the Asshole,"For some context: I’ve always been the jokester in my friend group. I love making people laugh and I often use humor, sometimes at the expense of others, without really thinking about how it might affect them. My friends usually appreciate my jokes, but there have been times when I’ve crossed the line.

Last weekend, we had a small gathering at my place to celebrate my friend Sarah’s recent promotion. Everyone was excited, and the atmosphere was cheerful. As we were sitting around and sharing stories, Sarah mentioned how she had to pull some late nights to complete a project for her new role. I saw an opportunity for a joke and, without thinking, I blurted out, “Well, at least you weren’t busy applying for a job at McDonald's, right?”

The room went silent. Everyone looked at me, then at Sarah, whose smile quickly faded. I realized that my joke had landed flat and hurt her feelings. She responded with a forced laugh and said, “Yeah, well, it’s a good thing I’m not that desperate.” The mood shifted, and I felt the tension rise in the room.

After a few awkward moments, I tried to recover by making another joke, but it just didn’t work. Sarah later left early, and a couple of my friends privately told me that I had gone too far. I brushed it off, saying I was just trying to lighten the mood, but deep down, I felt a twinge of regret.

Now, I’m questioning whether I was in the wrong. I genuinely thought my joke would be funny and that everyone would laugh, including Sarah. But looking back, I realize it was thoughtless and insensitive, especially considering she had just achieved something significant and was probably feeling a mix of stress and excitement.

One of my friends, Sarah, has a habit of bringing her own food to gatherings because she’s on a strict diet. I usually don’t mind, but this time, she brought a whole meal that ended up taking up most of the space on the table, pushing my dishes aside. 

During dinner, I noticed that Sarah was being rude about my cooking, making comments like, ""I don't eat this kind of food"" and ""You should really try to make healthier options next time."" I felt embarrassed and hurt, especially since I had put so much effort into the meal.

After dinner, Sarah insisted on taking home the leftovers of her own food, but I told her that she could take a small portion, but not all of it. I thought that was reasonable since she didn’t even touch my food. She got upset and called me selfish for not letting her take it all.

We’ve been living together for a couple of years, and he’s always been really supportive of my friendships. Anyway, I invited a couple of new friends over, Sarah and Tom, who I met recently through a mutual friend.

As the night went on and we were playing games, I couldn’t help but notice how much fun Sarah and Tom were having. Sarah is really outgoing and funny, and at one point, I joked that we should form a new ""dream team"" for game nights, just the three of us. I was feeling a bit mischievous, so I added, ""Sorry, Jake, but it seems like I found my new favorite gaming partners!""

Jake laughed at first, but then he looked a little hurt. I thought he was just being overly sensitive, so I kept joking about how he might have to step aside for my new squad. I didn't think much of it at the time. After a few games, I noticed Jake was a bit quieter than usual, and when I asked him if he was okay, he just shrugged it off.

Later on, when Sarah and Tom left, Jake confronted me about what I said. He told me that while he understood I was joking, it felt really dismissive of our friendship and hurt his feelings. I brushed it off, saying it was all in good fun and he was being too serious about it. I told him he needed to lighten up and that friends can take a joke.

I was really caught off guard when he said he felt pretty upset by it, saying that it felt like I was trying to replace him as a friend. I thought it was just a harmless joke, but now I’m feeling a little guilty. Everyone’s been saying I should have been more considerate of Jake's feelings, but I still think he’s overreacting.

I told her that I wouldn't be able to take on the full responsibilities of being her maid of honor and suggested that she pick someone else for the role. I thought she would understand, but she was really hurt and upset. She accused me of not supporting her during one of the most important times in her life.

She’s super friendly, and everyone seems to like her, but I’ve noticed she has a bit of a quirky sense of humor. One day, while she was on her lunch break, I overheard her talking about how she was nervous about her first work review coming up. Just out of nowhere, I thought it would be hilarious to joke about it in front of everyone.

So, during a team meeting, I casually brought it up, saying something like, “Hey Sarah, don’t worry about your review! I heard if you just keep your head down and smile a lot, they can’t possibly fire you!” Everyone chuckled, but I could see Sarah's face drop a little. I thought she was just being overly sensitive, so I didn’t think much of it.

Later that week, I overheard her talking to a couple of coworkers about how she was feeling anxious about the review. I decided it would be funny to join in, so I made a meme about “office reviews” and tagged her in it, saying, “When your review is coming up and you can’t stop thinking about how you’ll be fired!” I thought it was all in good fun, but she didn’t seem to find it funny at all. She didn’t laugh and just walked away looking upset.

A few days later, I found out she was actually really stressed about her performance and was worried she might not get a raise. It turns out my jokes were making her feel worse.

Last month, she asked if I could help her with her job hunt. I agreed to help review her resume and practice interview questions. However, I was pretty blunt in my feedback. I told her her resume was weak and that she needed to work on her confidence when speaking about herself. I suggested she attend a few workshops to improve her skills and told her she was being too picky with job applications.

I recently hosted a game night at my place, which I’ve done many times before. I usually prepare snacks and drinks, and I try to make it fun for everyone. However, this time, I decided to do something a little different. I’ve been on a health kick lately and have been working out and eating healthier. So, I thought it would be a good idea to only serve healthy snacks and drinks, like veggies with hummus, fruit, and sparkling water.

When my friends arrived, I could tell they were a bit taken aback. They were expecting pizza and chips, like we usually have. I laughed it off and told them that it was time to be healthy and that they’d thank me later for it. A couple of my friends jokingly complained, but I just shrugged it off and insisted that they’d enjoy the alternatives.

As the night went on, I could see that many of them were visibly disappointed. They were trying to enjoy the snacks, but I could see they were craving the junk food we usually have. When I refused to order pizza later in the evening, one of my friends suggested we order something unhealthy for delivery, but I shot that idea down immediately. I told them that if they wanted to eat junk food, they should just go home and eat it. I said I was trying to promote a healthier lifestyle.

By the end of the night, my friends left feeling unsatisfied and kind of annoyed with me.

You're the Asshole,"I'm a 29-year-old woman and I've been dating my boyfriend, Jake, who is 31, for about two years. We recently moved in together, and for the most part, things have been great. However, I tend to be very particular about our living space and have some strong opinions on how things should be organized.

Jake loves to cook and often experiments with new recipes. He has a passion for trying out different flavors and cuisines, which I think is great. However, he tends to leave the kitchen in quite a mess after he's done cooking. This has become a source of tension between us. I asked him several times to clean up after himself, but it seems to go in one ear and out the other.

One day, I came home after a long day of work and found the kitchen looking like a tornado had hit it. There were dishes piled up in the sink, counters covered in flour, and pots and pans strewn everywhere. I snapped. I started yelling about how he never listens to me and how I shouldn’t have to come home to a disaster. 

Jake was taken aback and tried to explain that he was working on a new dish and got carried away. Instead of listening, I just kept berating him for being inconsiderate and not respecting our shared space. I told him that if he couldn't handle keeping the house clean, maybe he shouldn't cook at all.

He ended up getting really upset and said that cooking was his way of unwinding and expressing himself, and I was ruining it for him. I felt justified in my anger, thinking that I had every right to be frustrated with the mess. After our argument, I went to bed without resolving anything, while Jake stayed in the kitchen cleaning up in silence.

Now, I feel guilty about how I reacted, but I still think I was right to be upset. AITA for losing my temper over the mess in the kitchen?",821,2008,0.68,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_57044,2021-11-03 00:00:00,YTA,1792,AITA
You're the Asshole,"We’re both 26.

I've been dating my girlfriend for about a year. She's really into fitness and often posts workout videos on her social media. Recently, she was preparing for a big fitness competition and was super focused on her training and diet. I wanted to support her, so I suggested that I film her workouts to help her improve her form and maybe even capture some great footage for her social media.

When we were filming, I noticed that she was struggling with a few exercises, and instead of being encouraging, I made some sarcastic comments about her form, thinking it would lighten the mood. I even joked about how she should maybe switch to an easier workout. At the time, I thought it was funny, but looking back, I can see that it was really disrespectful.

After I posted some of the videos on my own social media, I tagged her in them, thinking it would be a nice way to show off her hard work. Instead, she was really upset with me. She felt like I was undermining her efforts and didn't respect her goals. She even said that my comments made her question her confidence in her abilities.

I tried to defend myself by saying I was just joking and that I thought she would appreciate the exposure, but she ended up crying and told me I was being inconsiderate. I don’t think I did anything that bad, but now she’s been distant, and I feel like I’m in the wrong for wanting to share her journey.

You're the Asshole,"A few months ago, my best friend, Sarah, started dating a guy named Jake. They seemed really happy together, and I was supportive at first. However, I soon found out that Jake had a history of being manipulative and controlling in his past relationships. I expressed my concerns to Sarah, but she brushed them off, saying that he was different with her.

As their relationship progressed, I noticed more red flags. Jake would often belittle Sarah in front of others and would get upset if she wanted to spend time away from him. I tried to talk to her about it again, but she insisted that I was just jealous and didn’t want to see her happy. 

One day, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I confronted Jake directly, accusing him of being a toxic influence on Sarah and telling him to back off. I was really upset and used some harsh words, calling him a ""loser"" and saying he was trying to control her life. 

Sarah found out about our confrontation and was furious. She said that I had overstepped and that my actions could have put her in danger by provoking Jake. Now, she’s cut me off completely, and I feel horrible about the whole situation.

You're the Asshole,"So, I’m 22 and I’ve recently been really into fitness and health. I’ve started eating clean, working out every day, and I've even become a bit of a fitness influencer on social media, sharing my workouts and meal prep. My friends used to join me for gym sessions and we’d have fun together, but ever since I got really serious about it, they’ve kind of fallen off.

The problem is, I’ve started judging them for not taking their health seriously. Last week, I hosted a small get-together at my place. I prepared healthy snacks and shared my latest workout routine with everyone. When one of my friends brought chips and soda, I made a sarcastic comment about how “some people just don’t care about their bodies.” It definitely killed the vibe, and some of my friends looked uncomfortable.

After the party, a couple of my friends texted me saying I was being rude and that they felt judged. I brushed it off and told them they needed to toughen up and stop being so sensitive. I genuinely believe that my lifestyle is the best choice, and I can’t stand how some people refuse to take care of themselves.

Recently, he decided to join a weight loss support group, and I thought it was a great idea. I even offered to help him by cooking healthy meals for us both to eat together, which he appreciated.

However, a few weeks into this, he started to slip back into old habits. He would skip our meal prep sessions, forget to track his calories, and would often binge on junk food when I wasn't around. I tried to be supportive, but it was frustrating for me to see him not taking this seriously.

One day, I was working from home and decided to take a break for lunch. I walked into the kitchen to find him with a giant pizza, completely ignoring our plans for healthy meals. I snapped, telling him that he was being lazy and that he’d never lose weight if he kept this up. I said he was wasting my time and my effort because I was trying to help him, and he clearly wasn’t committed.

He got upset and said he felt judged and that I didn’t understand how hard it was for him. I told him that the support group was there for that reason, and he needed to take responsibility for his own health. I then went on to tell him that if he didn't want to make an effort, I wasn't going to keep cooking for him.

However, my sister and her partner are really strict about their parenting choices, including their decision to not allow any screen time for their baby, which they feel is important for healthy development. I think that’s a little extreme, but I respected their decision—at least, I tried to.

One day, I was babysitting and, not thinking much of it, I decided to play a cartoon on my laptop for my niece. She loved it and was giggling, and I thought I was doing a good job entertaining her.

However, I have a bit of a complicated history with Sarah. She can be very controlling and has a tendency to make everything about her. Last year, she took over the trip planning and didn't let anyone else contribute, which frustrated a lot of us. I felt like I was just there to follow her lead, and it significantly dampened my enjoyment of the trip.

This year, I decided that I didn't want to go along with her plans.

During the party, my friends and I decided to play a board game, and Sarah’s boyfriend insisted on joining in. I didn’t really want him there since I wasn’t sure how well he’d fit in with the group, but I didn’t want to be rude and exclude him, so I let him play. 

As the game went on, I noticed that he wasn’t contributing much and was mostly just sitting back, making the occasional comment.

So, I (28M) recently got into a heated argument with my sister (24F) over a family gathering. My family has a tradition of getting together every year for a big Thanksgiving dinner. This year, my parents decided to host it at their house, and naturally, everyone is expected to bring a dish. I usually make my famous lasagna, which everyone loves.

However, this year I was feeling a bit adventurous and decided to try a new recipe – a vegan mushroom and spinach risotto. I thought it would be a nice change and would be suitable for my sister, who has recently gone vegan. I told my family about the switch, and everyone seemed excited, except for my sister. She insisted that I should just stick to the lasagna, claiming that the family expects it and that I shouldn’t experiment with the food at a gathering. 

I felt a bit stifled by her comments, so I brushed them off and said I was excited to share something new with the family. This led to her getting annoyed, and she accused me of being selfish and not considering what everyone really wants to eat. I told her she was being unreasonable and that trying new things is part of the fun of cooking. We ended up arguing, and I said some things I probably shouldn’t have about her being overly controlling about food preferences. 

On the day of the dinner, I brought the risotto, and while I did make a smaller portion of lasagna as a backup, I was really hoping everyone would enjoy the new dish. When we sat down to eat, I served the risotto first, and my sister rolled her eyes and refused to try it, saying she was ""just going to stick with the lasagna."" 

When I noticed that nobody was touching the risotto, I joked that maybe they needed to expand their taste buds. My family laughed, but my sister shot me a glare, and it made the atmosphere a bit tense. Eventually, she went on a tirade about how I ruined Thanksgiving by not bringing the dish everyone loves and that I was being inconsiderate.

When Laura found out what I had done, she was pretty upset. She told me that I had crossed a line and that it was her wedding, not mine. I was taken aback because I thought I was helping her by making it more exciting. I told her that she should be grateful for my efforts to make her day special.

Now she's distant, and I feel like I might have ruined our friendship over trying to help her. I genuinely thought I was doing the right thing, but now I’m questioning myself.

You're the Asshole,"Title: AITA for telling my friend she can’t wear a casual outfit to my party?

So here’s the situation. I’m throwing a big birthday party this weekend, and it’s going to have a specific theme: “Cocktail Attire.” I’ve been planning this for a while and even sent out the invites with clear instructions about the dress code because I want everyone to look nice and fit the theme.

One of my closest friends, let’s call her Sarah, texted me a few days ago saying she was really excited for the party but that she was planning on wearing a casual sundress and sandals because she didn’t have anything else. I was kind of taken aback and told her that it’s really important to me that everyone follows the dress code, especially since it’s a themed party.

She responded saying she didn’t have the budget for a new outfit and that she was really just looking forward to hanging out with friends. I felt bad for her, but I also think if she comes in a casual outfit, it’ll ruin the vibe I’m trying to create. I told her that maybe she could borrow something from one of our other friends or find something secondhand, but she seemed really upset and said she just doesn’t feel comfortable dressing up.

I ended up being pretty firm and told her that if she couldn’t follow the dress code, I would prefer if she didn’t come at all. Now I feel like an asshole for putting my party theme over my friend’s feelings, but I really want this party to be special.

So, AITA for telling my friend she can't wear a casual outfit to my party?",179,2620,0.62,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_24470,2018-12-11 00:00:00,YTA,1526,AITA
You're the Asshole,"Here's the long and short:

I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for two years. Things were going well, and we decided to move in together a few months ago. I have a pretty demanding job, and while I love her, I admit I've been focusing more on my career lately. I also have a habit of being a bit too blunt and honest, which has led to some friction between us.

A few weeks ago, she mentioned wanting to go out for dinner to celebrate our anniversary, and I didn’t think it was a big deal to suggest we stay in and watch a movie instead. I told her it would save us money and we could have a cozy night at home. She seemed really disappointed, but I brushed it off, thinking she would come around.

On the day of our anniversary, I came home late from work and found her waiting for me with a nice dinner prepared. I was taken aback but still suggested we eat while watching a show. She got upset and said she was trying to make the evening special. I told her it was just a dinner and we could celebrate another time. I didn't see why it was such a big deal.

Later that night, I overheard her talking to her friend on the phone, and she was crying. I felt a twinge of guilt, but I still thought she was overreacting. I told her she should just lighten up and that we’d have plenty of time to celebrate in the future.

Now, she’s been distant and I’m starting to realize I may have messed things up. I still think my suggestion made sense, but maybe I was an asshole for not recognizing how important the night was to her. 

So, AITA for suggesting we skip our anniversary dinner?",947,1956,0.65,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_65490,2021-12-18 00:00:00,YTA,1593,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I (29M) recently went to a party at a friend's house, and my girlfriend (27F) was there too. We’ve been dating for a little over a year, and things have been going well. At this party, I started chatting with some friends about our favorite movies and the latest superhero films. I love joking around and being a bit sarcastic, and I expected my friends to enjoy it just as much. 

At one point, someone brought up how they're tired of all the new superhero movies being so ""woke"" and inclusive. Instead of just listening, I jumped in and started making jokes about it, saying things like ""Next, they're going to make Spider-Man a vegan who only fights crime for environmental reasons."" Everyone laughed initially, but then I noticed my girlfriend's face was a bit off. She seemed uncomfortable, but I brushed it off, thinking she was just not in the mood for jokes.

Later on, during a conversation about a female superhero, I made a comment about how they should stick to the ""classic"" versions of characters because the new ones are just pandering. I remember saying something like, “If they keep changing everything, it’ll just confuse the kids,” and added a quip about how superheroes should be good role models, not political statements. 

My girlfriend finally spoke up, clearly upset, and said something like, “Not everything needs to be a joke, and you’re being pretty insensitive.” I responded by saying she was overreacting and that this was just how we joked around as friends. I thought I was just being funny and didn't think that my comments were actually hurtful. I continued to laugh and make more jokes, thinking I was entertaining everyone.

Eventually, the mood turned sour, and my girlfriend decided to leave early, taking a few of her friends with her. As we were leaving, she told me that I needed to learn when to tone it down and that I was being dismissive of important issues. I shrugged it off, thinking she was just sensitive and that it was no big deal.

The next day, I texted her to apologize, but I didn't really mean it. I just wanted her to stop being mad at me. She still hasn't talked to me properly, and I feel like she’s making a big deal out of nothing. Some of my friends think she’s being too sensitive about my jokes, while others think I should’ve been more considerate.

You're the Asshole,"I (30M) recently went on a date with a girl (28F) I met online. She’s half Asian and half Caucasian, and from the moment we sat down, I could tell she was really proud of her Asian heritage. I respect that, but it seemed like she was trying to distance herself from her Caucasian side completely.

During our conversation, she kept referring to herself as ""not really white"" and talked about how much she disliked any part of her Caucasian background. I get that everyone has their own experiences, but it felt off to me. She even mentioned that she felt more connected to her Asian side because of the culture and traditions, which is totally fine, but I think she was being a bit dismissive of her other half.

At one point, we were talking about food, and she started making comments about how “white people” don’t know how to cook authentic Asian food. I tried to lighten the mood by joking that I would love to learn some recipes from her, but she just rolled her eyes and insisted that I wouldn’t understand. I was taken aback because I thought she was being unnecessarily rude.

Instead of just letting it go, I pushed back a little. I told her that it sounded a bit racist to say that “white people can’t cook” and that her dismissive attitude toward her own heritage was a bit strange. I thought I was just pointing out a contradiction in her views, but it clearly upset her.

She ended up getting really defensive, telling me that I couldn't understand because I’m not part of her culture. I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings, but I stood by my statement. Our date ended awkwardly, and I can't shake the feeling that I might have crossed a line.

A few weeks ago, I got an opportunity to attend a major conference in another state. I was excited about it because it could open up new career paths for me. However, it would mean that I would be away for nearly a week, and I was worried about how it would affect our time together. 

Instead of discussing it with him, I impulsively decided to book a last-minute trip for him to join me at the conference. I thought it would be a fun getaway for both of us and a nice surprise. I simply told him that I had booked us a trip and that he should take time off work. He was shocked and said he couldn't just take a week off on such short notice. He had important projects due and couldn’t leave his team hanging. 

I got frustrated with him because I had put a lot of effort into planning this trip, and I felt it was inconsiderate of him not to prioritize our relationship. I kept insisting that he should figure it out and just go with me, claiming that it would be a great bonding experience. In the end, he had to turn down the trip, and I went alone.

One day, during a particularly busy morning, a customer came in with a very specific order that required some extra attention. I was already swamped and feeling super stressed because the line was out the door. When Sarah asked for help, I snapped at her, telling her I didn’t have time to hold her hand and that she needed to figure it out on her own. I was frustrated and didn’t stop to think about how my words could affect her.

After that, I noticed Sarah was visibly upset and I didn’t really care. I felt justified in my reaction because I believed she should have been quicker on the draw. A few days later, I overheard her talking to another coworker about how my harsh words made her feel inadequate and discouraged. Instead of apologizing or trying to make things right, I brushed it off, thinking she just needed to toughen up.

A couple of weeks later, I was having a bad day and ended up making a mistake on an order. Sarah, who had been working hard to improve, fixed it without saying a word about my earlier attitude. I felt a little guilty but still didn’t think I owed her an apology for how I had treated her.

I’ve always felt a bit uneasy about their friendship because they have a history of being very flirty, even when he was dating me. However, I tried to be understanding and trust him.

One weekend, my boyfriend had a game night with his friends, including Sarah. I decided to stay at home because I had a bad cold and wasn’t feeling well. A few hours into the night, my boyfriend called to check on me and I jokingly said, “Don’t have too much fun without me!” 

Later that evening, I started feeling a bit better and thought it would be nice to surprise him and bring over some snacks. When I arrived at their place, I walked in to find Sarah sitting on his lap, laughing and playfully hitting him. My heart sank. 

I tried to brush it off and acted cheerful as I greeted everyone. My boyfriend looked a bit surprised but didn’t seem overly concerned. I handed him the snacks and sat down next to him. The vibe was awkward, and I could sense the tension.

As the night went on, I couldn't shake the feeling that Sarah was trying to get a rise out of me. At one point, she leaned in and whispered something to my boyfriend, which made him laugh. I felt my blood boil. Without thinking, I snapped and told her to back off. 

My boyfriend looked shocked, and Sarah rolled her eyes, saying I was overreacting. I called her out for being inappropriate and told her it was disrespectful to sit on his lap when I was there. My boyfriend tried to diffuse the situation, but I was already too heated. I ended up saying some really mean things to both of them and storming out.

At one point during dinner, the conversation turned to past relationships. One of her friends started sharing funny stories about her exes, and everyone was laughing and having a good time.

Caught up in the moment, I decided to share a story about my own ex-girlfriend. I thought it would be lighthearted, but in hindsight, I realized it came off as pretty mean-spirited. I told them about how my ex would always make plans and then cancel them last minute, which really frustrated me. I intended it to be a funny anecdote, but I ended up making her sound really inconsiderate and selfish.

In contrast, I was never really focused during my college years and ended up changing my major multiple times before finally dropping out. I’ve been working various part-time jobs since then, trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. I’ve been living with my parents, which I know isn’t ideal, but it’s been comfortable, and I’m saving money while I figure things out.

Recently, my brother's internship turned into a full-time job offer, and he’s been celebrating his achievements with friends and family. I couldn’t help but feel jealous of all the attention he was getting, especially since it highlighted my own lack of direction. In a moment of frustration, I made a sarcastic comment during a family dinner about how my brother's success was overrated and that internships don’t mean anything in the real world. I said something like, “Good luck with your ‘big boy’ job when you realize that it’s just a glorified coffee-fetching position.” 

My parents were taken aback, especially my brother, who looked hurt and confused. They all tried to defend him, and my mom said I was being an ass for undermining his accomplishments. I ended up storming out of the dinner, feeling like they were all against me.

I (F25) have a friend, Sarah (F26), who has been struggling with her mental health for a while now. She's been very open about her battles with anxiety and depression, and I try my best to support her. However, I sometimes feel like it’s draining me emotionally, and I’ve been feeling overwhelmed.

Last week, Sarah reached out to me late at night, clearly in distress. Instead of offering the support she needed, I got frustrated. I had a long day at work, and I was really tired, so I snapped at her. I told her that she needs to stop being so negative and that her problems are affecting my mental health too.

I suggested she might want to see a therapist or join a support group, but I didn’t offer any real solutions or resources, just my opinion.

Now I’m questioning if I was in the wrong here.

She has a very specific vision for her wedding, and she’s been asking for my opinions on various aspects, including the guest list. She’s really passionate about keeping the guest list small and intimate, which I totally respect.

When I tried to advocate for Sarah, suggesting that she would actually be a great addition, Emily got defensive. I ended up telling her that if she didn’t want Sarah there, then I wouldn’t attend the wedding. 

Emily was upset and accused me of being selfish, but I really felt like she was being unreasonable. After all, it’s my girlfriend, and she should be included in significant events in my life. Now, Emily is hurt, our parents are caught in the middle, and I feel like I’m standing my ground.

When I told him about the date, he seemed excited too, but then he mentioned that the fantasy football draft was happening the same night. I asked him to skip it, explaining that I had put a lot of effort into planning our evening. He said he didn't want to let his friends down since he had committed to being there.

You're the Asshole,"I’m really struggling with a situation involving my sister and I could use some outside perspective.

So, my sister recently graduated from college, and I was really proud of her. She worked hard for her degree, and I wanted to celebrate this milestone. I decided to throw her a surprise graduation party with our family and some of her close friends. I thought it would be a nice way to show her how much I care and appreciate her achievements.

However, when I was planning the party, I didn’t ask her what she wanted. I just assumed she would love a big celebration. I organized everything - the venue, the decorations, and even a cake with her name on it. I even invited some family members that she hasn’t spoken to in years, thinking it would be a good opportunity for them to reconnect.

When I finally revealed the surprise party to her, she looked completely overwhelmed and upset. She told me she appreciated my intention, but she really didn’t want a big party. She had been looking forward to a quiet dinner with just our immediate family to celebrate. She felt anxious about being the center of attention and felt uncomfortable with some of the family members I invited. 

After the party, she expressed to me how frustrated she was that I didn't listen to what she wanted. I tried to defend myself by saying I was just trying to do something nice for her and that she should be grateful for the effort I put in. I thought everyone would have a good time, but she felt pressured and stressed instead. 

Now, other family members are starting to weigh in, and some of them agree with her, saying I overstepped by not considering her feelings. But I still don’t see what was so wrong about wanting to celebrate her. I thought I was being a good sister.

You're the Asshole,"I recently had a birthday party at my apartment, and I invited a group of friends over for a fun night of games and food. I was really excited because I hadn't hosted anything in a while. I made sure to plan everything out, from the decorations to the playlist, and I even prepared a bunch of snacks and drinks.

A couple of days before the party, I noticed that my friend Sarah had posted on social media that she was having a small get-together at her place on the same day and invited a few mutual friends. I felt a bit annoyed because I thought it was inconsiderate of her to schedule something on the same day as my party without checking in with me first. I decided I didn’t want her to steal my thunder, so I sent out a group text to our mutual friends reminding them about my party and encouraging them to come over to celebrate with me.

On the day of my birthday, Sarah's party started a little earlier than mine, and I saw pictures of our friends having fun there. It really got to me, and I felt like no one would show up to my party because they'd all be at hers instead. When my guests began to arrive, I was visibly upset, and I kept bringing up Sarah’s party, trying to make it clear that I was hurt by her actions. I even went as far as to say that anyone who chose to go to her party instead of mine was ""not a true friend.""

As the night went on, I kept complaining about Sarah and her party, which put a damper on the mood. My friends tried to change the subject and encourage me to enjoy my evening, but I couldn’t help myself. Looking back, I realize I made everyone uncomfortable with my attitude and jealousy. A few of my friends eventually left early because they felt awkward.

My boyfriend, whom I've been dating for about a year, comes from a small town and his family isn’t as well off as I am.

My boyfriend has been asking me to come visit his family for months. He says they would love to meet me and I know it’s important to him. But honestly, I can’t bring myself to do it. I feel like I would be embarrassed to meet them. I imagine they would judge me or think I’m snobby because of my education and career. Plus, my boyfriend has mentioned some of their habits and interests, and I just don’t relate to that kind of lifestyle at all. 

I told him that I don’t want to “lower myself” to meet his family, and that it would be uncomfortable for both of us. He was really hurt by my comment and tried to convince me that they’re just normal, nice people who would be excited to meet me. But I just can’t shake the feeling that I’m above that situation.

When everyone arrived, we set up the table and I suggested we start with my game. Jake was a bit hesitant, saying it might not be everyone's style, but I insisted we should try it since I was hosting.

As we started playing, it became clear that the game was a bit inappropriate and really crude. There were a lot of adult themes and jokes that made Sarah and Emily visibly uncomfortable. They exchanged glances and tried to laugh it off at first, but it was clear they weren't having fun. I noticed but thought they were just being overly sensitive. The game continued, and I kept making jokes, thinking they would eventually loosen up.

Halfway through, Sarah finally spoke up and said she didn’t feel comfortable with the game and suggested we switch to something else. I brushed her off and insisted we keep playing, saying, ""It’s just a game, lighten up!"" I thought it was all in good fun and that they’d come around. 

Eventually, after one particularly crude round, both Sarah and Emily got up and left, saying they were done for the night. Hannah followed them out, looking annoyed with me. Jake stayed but was clearly uncomfortable too and told me I should have listened to the girls.

At this particular wedding, my wife teared up during the vows, which I thought was sweet. But then, during the reception, she started talking about how she couldn’t wait for our own wedding one day and how she wished we could have a big celebration too. I was a bit annoyed because we’ve been talking about having a small, intimate wedding, and I felt like she was being overly dramatic about it.

As the night went on, I started to get frustrated. I could tell she was feeling really emotional, but I didn’t want to be in that headspace. I started making snide comments, like “Well, we can’t all have extravagant weddings,” and “Not everyone needs to make a big deal out of it.” I thought I was being funny, but my jokes fell flat, and she looked hurt.

Later, when the dancing started, I pulled her aside and told her to lighten up and stop being so emotional about someone else's wedding. I said it was their day, not ours, and she shouldn’t let it get to her like that. She started to cry, and I realized I had gone too far. But instead of apologizing right away, I doubled down and told her she needed to get over it.

By the end of the night, she was really upset, and we ended up having a huge argument in the car on the way home. She said I was being insensitive, and I told her she was overreacting. Now she’s really hurt and says I made her feel bad for being emotional about something beautiful.

So, this happened a couple of months ago. I (24F) live with my boyfriend (25M) in a small apartment. We have a decent relationship, but I have to admit, I can be pretty demanding when it comes to maintaining a clean living space. I like everything to be in its place and organized, while my boyfriend is a bit more laid-back about things. 

One day, I came home from work to find the living room a mess. There were dirty dishes on the coffee table, clothes strewn about, and crumbs on the couch. I was already having a long day, so the sight of the mess really threw me off. I asked my boyfriend if he could clean up before I got home, and he said he would but clearly didn't.

I decided to take matters into my own hands. Instead of talking to him about it, I started cleaning the living room myself. But instead of just tidying up, I also decided to throw out some of his things that I considered clutter. I tossed out an old video game case, some magazines, and a couple of clothes that were lying around. I figured he wouldn’t even notice since he hadn’t touched them in ages.

When my boyfriend got home, he was understandably upset. He asked me where his stuff had gone, and I casually told him that it was just clutter and he should be more responsible about cleaning up after himself. He insisted that I shouldn’t have thrown out his things without asking and that it was disrespectful. I got defensive and told him that he should be grateful I cleaned up at all because he was clearly incapable of doing it himself.

During one of our planning sessions, I jokingly suggested that for the bridal toast, I could make a funny reference to her first marriage. I thought it would be light-hearted and show how far she’s come, transitioning into a new chapter. I even considered saying something like, “At least you know how NOT to pick a husband this time!” I believed it would get a good laugh, and my sister seemed to think it was funny at first too.

However, after talking to some other friends and family members, I realized they thought it was in poor taste and disrespectful to her ex and their child. They urged me to rethink my approach, stating that bringing up her past marriage could ruin the mood and make things awkward.

Still, I feel like my intention was good, and the joke would have lightened the atmosphere. When I brought it up to my sister again, she seemed a bit hesitant and said maybe we shouldn't mention her ex at all during the toast.

My roommate and I have been living together for about a year. We get along well, and I really appreciate the friendship we’ve developed.

You're the Asshole,"I'm currently a junior in high school, and I recently got into a bit of a situation with my friend group. We were all hanging out at my place after school, just relaxing and watching movies. One of my friends, let's call her Sarah, has been trying really hard to lose weight and improve her fitness. She’s been working out a lot and even following a strict diet.

During our hangout, Sarah casually mentioned how she was craving pizza but was trying to resist because of her diet. I, not thinking much of it, jokingly said, ""Well, if you really wanted pizza, you could just let yourself go and stop being so uptight about your diet."" I thought it was funny in the moment, but Sarah looked really hurt and just shrugged it off. 

Later, she left early, and some of our other friends told me I was being a jerk for making that comment. They said I should have been more supportive of her efforts instead of making light of them. Honestly, I didn’t see what the big deal was; I was just trying to joke around. I mean, it’s just pizza, right?

You're the Asshole,"My friend has a small dog that she is absolutely in love with. She takes him everywhere and spoils him rotten. For her birthday, I decided to get her a thoughtful gift: a beautiful, custom-made dog bed. I thought it would be perfect for her little guy and show her that I care about what she loves.

When I gave it to her, she seemed excited at first, but then she hesitated and said she didn’t think her dog would even use it because he prefers to sleep in her bed. I was a bit taken aback and got defensive. I told her she was being ungrateful and that she should at least try it out for her dog. I insisted that it was a nice gift and that she shouldn’t dismiss it just because it wasn't what she expected.

She seemed upset and eventually said she appreciated the thought but would just stick with her current arrangement for now. I felt annoyed and went home feeling like she didn’t appreciate my generosity. I later texted her to say that I was disappointed she wasn’t more excited about the gift, and I suggested that maybe I could just ask her for the bed back if she wasn’t going to use it.

Looking back, I realize I might have overstepped and pressured her about how to use my gift. AITA?",32,858,0.71,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_42787,2021-01-11 00:00:00,YTA,1199,AITA

I find his enthusiasm adorable, but honestly, I think it's just a phase, and I don't want to encourage it too much because I believe he should focus on things that have more educational value.

One day, he asked me if we could go to the natural history museum to see the dinosaur exhibit. I immediately shot him down and told him that dinosaurs are boring and it's just a collection of bones. I mentioned that there are much cooler things to see, like the space exhibit, which I think he would enjoy more.

My son looked crushed, but after a few days, he kept asking if we could still go. I kept telling him no, insisting that he'd be disappointed. I even told him that I wouldn't enjoy it, and I didn’t want to waste my time on something so trivial. 

Eventually, I just decided it would be better to avoid the conversation altogether, and when he asked again, I told him that we just don’t have time for silly things like that.

You're the Asshole,"I (35F) have a younger sister, Jess (27F), who recently got engaged. I’m really happy for her, but I have some concerns about her fiancé, Tom (30M). He’s a nice guy, but I’ve noticed he can be a bit controlling and has made some comments that made me feel uneasy about how he treats Jess. 

When Jess asked me to be her maid of honor, I was thrilled and wanted to support her in every way. We started planning the wedding together, and I tried to be as involved as possible. However, during the planning process, I started to notice some red flags about Tom. For instance, he often dismissed Jess’s opinions about the wedding, insisting that things should be done his way. I tried to bring my concerns up to Jess, but she brushed them off, saying he was just being practical.

One day, while we were browsing for wedding dresses, Jess mentioned that Tom had suggested she shouldn’t wear a strapless dress because “it would attract too much attention.” I couldn’t help but feel upset, and I openly told Jess that I thought that was overly controlling. I even said that if she didn't feel comfortable in a dress she loved just because of Tom's opinion, then she needed to reconsider her choices. Jess was really hurt by my comment and insisted that I was overreacting. 

After that, I started to worry that I might be ruining her special day. So, I decided to take a step back from the planning process. I didn’t attend a few important meetings and didn’t help her pick the venue, which ultimately made Jess feel abandoned. She confronted me about it, and I told her I just wanted her to have the wedding she wanted, not one that Tom dictated. I thought I was making the right choice to protect her, but instead, it only caused a rift between us.

At the engagement party, Jess made a toast thanking everyone for their support, but she specifically mentioned how disappointed she was that I hadn’t been as present. I felt embarrassed and defensive. I brought up my concerns about Tom again in front of everyone, thinking it would help Jess see my point of view. Instead, it turned into a huge argument, and Jess ended up crying and leaving the party.

Now, my family is split. Some agree with me and think Tom is problematic, while others say I overstepped and should have kept my opinions to myself.

She told me that she wants to have a ""bridesmaid reveal"" where she surprises her bridesmaids with their dresses and asks them to be part of her wedding in a big, theatrical way. I get that it's her big day and she wants to make it special, but she wants to do this whole event where she hosts a party and makes a huge deal out of it. I think it's completely unnecessary and a waste of time and money.

I told her that I think she should just send a text or call her bridesmaids and let them know they’re in for an intimate celebration. I suggested that she shouldn't make such a big spectacle out of it when most of us have busy lives and can't always drop everything for a big reveal party. I also mentioned that I think it's a bit self-centered to expect everyone to focus so much on her wedding plans like that.

She got really upset with me and said I was being negative and unsupportive of her excitement. I told her that I just think there are more important things to focus on than a fancy reveal. I even offered to help her with the planning if she kept it simple, but she didn't like that idea.

She's currently in her final year of university, and she’s been working really hard on her thesis. Our family is really proud of her, and we all support her as much as we can. 

I’ve always been more laid-back and have taken a different approach to life. I work a steady job but it's not particularly demanding, and I've been known to enjoy going out with friends, partying, and just having fun without too much worry about the future. About a month ago, I decided to throw a big party at my place to celebrate my birthday. I wanted to invite all my friends and have a great time. 

A few days before the party, I thought it would be fun to invite my sister as well. I texted her and told her she should come, and I even mentioned that I planned on having a casual theme, where everyone would dress up in funny outfits. She immediately replied that she couldn’t come because she had to finish her thesis and needed to focus on her studies. I, being the way I am, jokingly responded with something like, ""Come on, it's just one night! You can finish your thesis later – life is too short to be so serious!"" I thought it was just some friendly banter.

Well, the day of the party arrived, and I had a blast with my friends. We were all loud, playing music, and just having a good time. I did think about my sister a couple of times and even sent her a few photos of the party, just to show her how much fun we were having. 

The next day, I got a long text from my sister. She was furious. She said that my comments about her studies were really dismissive and that I should have respected her priorities. She said I was being selfish for not understanding how important this was for her. I honestly thought she was overreacting. It was just a party, and I was just trying to lighten the mood! 

I tried to explain that I was just joking and that I thought she’d enjoy herself if she came, but she didn’t want to hear it. Now she’s pretty much stopped talking to me, and I feel really bad.

I’ve always been a bit sarcastic and like to poke fun, and I thought it would be funny to tease her about her new job, given that she’s always been a bit dramatic about it.

Last week, during a small get-together, I started joking about how she was probably going to be the next CEO and how we should all start calling her “Boss Lady.” I meant it light-heartedly and thought it would elicit a laugh. Instead, Jamie looked genuinely hurt and said, “Can you not? I’m really trying to take this seriously, and it’s not a joke to me.” 

I shrugged it off and continued to throw in more jokes about her being the “office superstar” and how she’d be handing out promotions like candy. My friends started to feel uncomfortable, and I could tell Jamie was upset. After a while, she excused herself from the conversation and went to another room, and I realized I had probably gone too far.

I was really excited for her and wanted to help out, so I offered to make a beautiful cake for the occasion. I love baking and thought it would be a nice touch.

The day before the party, I spent hours baking and decorating a gorgeous three-tier cake, complete with her favorite flavors and personalized decorations to match their wedding theme. I was really proud of it and couldn’t wait to see the look on her face.

However, my sister called me the night before and told me that her fiancé's mother had insisted on bringing a cake as well, a family recipe that she is really proud of. I immediately felt a bit hurt and thought it was unnecessary, considering I already put in so much work. I didn’t want to just give in and let her mother-in-law overshadow my effort.

So, in a moment of pettiness, I decided to take a photo of my beautiful cake and post it on my social media, tagging my sister and saying something like, “Can’t wait to celebrate my sister’s engagement with this stunning cake!” I thought it would be a fun way to show off my work and make it clear that I was the one who put in the effort.

At the party, my sister ended up feeling really awkward because her fiancé’s mother was upset that I had posted about my cake when she wanted to showcase her own. My sister talked to me afterwards and said it made her feel caught in the middle, and that maybe I shouldn’t have put the post up.

I was excited about it because it had been a while since we had all hung out together. The group included Sarah, her boyfriend Tom, and another couple, Mike and Lisa.

The first night, we had a great time drinking and playing games. At one point, Sarah and Tom went to bed early, while the rest of us stayed up.

Feeling a bit mischievous, I went back to the living room, grabbed my phone, and recorded a short video through the slightly open door of them getting it on.

I tried to gently push him away, but he kept coming back, and I ended up yelling at him one day when he knocked over a coffee mug and spilled it everywhere. My girlfriend was not happy with me and said I should be more patient.

Since then, I’ve been feeling increasingly annoyed with the cats. The other cat, Bella, is a bit skittish and hides most of the time, but Max is always in my face. I took it a step further and started closing the office door to keep him out.

During the meeting, one of the topics was about creating a community garden. I was all for it! But when it came to discussing the rules and responsibilities, I started to dismiss the idea. I loudly expressed my opinion that gardening is a waste of time and that most people don't have the time or skills to maintain a garden anyway. I went on to say that people should just buy their food from the store instead of pretending they can grow it.

Afterwards, a few residents approached me to express their disappointment. They told me that gardening can be a therapeutic hobby and that it brings the community together. I brushed them off, saying they were just being overly sentimental about it. I even made a joke about how I didn’t want to smell like dirt and sweat while everyone else was playing in the mud. 

My girlfriend was at the meeting, and she told me later that I was being insensitive to the people who really wanted to create the garden and enjoy that experience. I felt like I was just being honest, but now I'm starting to wonder if I overstepped.

You're the Asshole,"I recently hosted a small get-together at my apartment to celebrate my birthday. I invited my close friends and a few acquaintances, including my friend Jake, who I know can be a bit loud and rowdy when he drinks.

During the party, everything was going well until Jake started drinking a bit too much. He became increasingly obnoxious, making crude jokes and getting overly physical with everyone. At one point, he spilled a drink on my friend Sarah and then tried to hug her to ""make it up to her,"" even though she clearly wasn’t comfortable with it. She pushed him away and told him to back off, but he just laughed it off and kept making comments.

I was embarrassed by his behavior, but instead of addressing it, I largely ignored it, thinking it was just Jake being Jake and that everyone would get over it. Later in the evening, Sarah pulled me aside and told me she felt uncomfortable and disrespected by how Jake was acting. She asked me to talk to him about it, but I brushed it off, saying it was just a party and people were having fun.

As the night went on, Jake got even more out of control. He started making inappropriate comments to other women at the party, and I could see that some of my friends were starting to feel uncomfortable too. Instead of stepping in, I just laughed along with him, not wanting to ruin the fun. 

Eventually, Sarah decided to leave early because she couldn’t handle it anymore, and I didn’t even try to convince her to stay. After everyone left, my roommate confronted me about how I let Jake's behavior go unchecked. He said I was being irresponsible by allowing someone to make others feel unsafe in my home and that I should have kicked Jake out when I had the chance.

I got defensive and told my roommate that I didn’t want to ruin the night for everyone else just because one person was being a bit loud.

You're the Asshole,"My partner and I have been married for about three years, and we recently decided to start planning for our first child. Naturally, this has led to a lot of discussions about baby names, which I thought would be a fun experience. However, we seem to have hit a snag.

My partner has a very close relationship with her cousin, who has always been like a brother to her. They grew up together, spent summers at the beach, and have supported each other through tough times. His name is ""Jason,"" and my partner has mentioned multiple times that she would love to name our son after him. At first, I thought it was sweet, but then I started to feel uncomfortable with it.

To be honest, I don't really like Jason. He can be pretty arrogant and has made some rude comments about my partner and me in the past, especially about our relationship. I know family is important, but I just don’t want to associate my child’s name with someone I don’t respect, even if my partner thinks highly of him.

When I finally voiced my concerns to her, I was met with a lot of frustration. She said that I was being selfish for not wanting to honor someone who has been such a big part of her life. I tried to explain that I just didn’t want our son to have a name tied to someone I viewed negatively, but she accused me of trying to control the situation and not valuing her feelings.

Now, I’ve suggested a few other names that I really like, but she’s been dismissive of them. I might have even been a bit harsh in my responses, saying things like, “You can’t be serious about wanting to name our son after that guy.” Looking back, I realize I could have handled the situation better and been more open to compromise.

A few months ago, I planned a big birthday party for myself. I’ve always loved throwing parties and celebrating with friends, and this year was no different. I decided to host it at a local venue and go all out with the decorations, food, and drinks. I invited around 30 of my closest friends and made it clear that this was going to be a fabulous affair.

A week before the party, I found out that one of my friends, Sarah, was going through a tough time. Her job had become really stressful, and her boyfriend had just broken up with her. I felt bad for her, so I reached out to see if she wanted to come to the party to unwind. However, I also mentioned that I was really hoping for a fun and carefree atmosphere, and I didn’t want any drama or heavy conversations.

On the day of the party, Sarah showed up looking quite upset. Instead of enjoying the festivities, she kept bringing up her problems and crying in the corner. I tried to be supportive, but I was also really trying to focus on having a good time with my other friends. At one point, I jokingly told her, “Come on, it’s my birthday! Can you please save the drama for another day?” 

After that, she seemed to get even more upset and eventually left the party early. A few days later, she texted me, saying that I was insensitive and that I should have been more supportive. I honestly thought I was just trying to keep the party fun, but now I’m second-guessing myself.

Last weekend, we were invited to a birthday party for one of my close friends. It was a casual get-together, and I thought it would be a good chance for Sarah to meet some of my other friends. Before the party, I told her that it would be a laid-back affair and that we should just enjoy ourselves.

At the party, things started off well. Everyone was chatting, and Sarah seemed to be having a good time. However, after a while, my friend Jake made a joke about a popular TV show that Sarah really likes. It was a harmless joke, but Sarah immediately turned defensive and started arguing with Jake about it, insisting that he didn't understand the show and that he was being rude.

I tried to intervene and lighten the mood by joking about how serious she was being, but she just got more upset. Instead of dropping it, she escalated the argument, and it turned awkward for everyone. Jake apologized, but Sarah wouldn’t let it go and kept arguing her point.

After a while, I pulled Sarah aside and asked her to chill out. I told her she was making a scene and that it was supposed to be a fun evening. She responded by saying that I was being unsupportive and that I should back her up, even if it was just a joke. I told her it was embarrassing for me and that she should try to not take things so seriously at parties.

When we got home, she was really upset and said that I should have defended her more. I told her I didn’t want to be associated with someone who could’t take a joke and was overly dramatic. Now she’s not speaking to me, and I feel like maybe I was too harsh on her in front of my friends.

He’s currently working part-time at a local store and spends a lot of his time playing video games and hanging out with friends, which I think is fine in moderation, but I also believe that he should be more responsible and focused on his future.

Last week, Emily threw a surprise birthday party for Jake, and I was invited. While everyone was celebrating, I couldn’t help but express my concerns about Jake’s lack of ambition, thinking it might help him reflect and realize he needs to step up.

You're the Asshole,"Hi all.

I need some perspective on my actions regarding my best friend, Lisa, and her recent engagement. 

Lisa has been with her fiancé, Mark, for about three years. They've always had a pretty solid relationship, and I was genuinely happy for them when they got engaged. However, I've always had a bit of a crush on Mark, even before they started dating. I kept it to myself because I valued my friendship with Lisa and wanted her to be happy.

When they announced their engagement, I felt a mix of emotions. I congratulated them, but deep down, I was struggling. One night, after a few drinks, I confessed to my closest friend about my feelings for Mark. I didn't mean for it to get out, but my friend let it slip to Lisa. 

Lisa confronted me about it, and in a moment of weakness, I told her that I thought Mark was making a mistake by marrying her because he could do so much better. I even suggested that she should think about whether he truly loves her. I thought I was being a good friend by looking out for her, but it turned into a huge fight.

Lisa was understandably hurt. She told me that I was being selfish and that my feelings didn't matter since they were about to get married. I felt bad for hurting her, but part of me also felt justified in my opinion about their relationship. 

Now, I’m realizing that I shouldn’t have said anything at all and that I let my jealousy get the best of me. I haven't talked to Lisa since the fight, and I’m afraid I might have ruined our friendship over this.

One evening, we were all hanging out at my place, and I noticed Sarah seemed particularly quiet. Wanting to lighten the mood, I jokingly suggested we all do a ""fashion show"" and show off some of our old clothes. Everyone laughed, and to keep the jokes rolling, I made a comment about how Sarah should dress up in some of her old outfits because she used to look amazing in them.

Instead of laughing it off, Sarah got visibly upset and told me that she wasn't in the mood to joke about her appearance and that she felt horrible about how she looked right now. I brushed it off and insisted that she should just have fun and not take it so seriously, thinking I was being supportive and encouraging her.

After that, the atmosphere turned awkward. Sarah left early, and I could tell she was hurt. My other friends later told me that I crossed a line and that I should’ve been more sensitive to what she was going through.

I thought I was just trying to lighten the mood, but now I’m wondering if I was an asshole for not being more considerate of her feelings. So, am I the asshole for trying to cheer up my friend by teasing her about her appearance?",384,2607,0.79,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_54021,2021-12-15 00:00:00,YTA,1469,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I recently attended a friend's birthday party, and while we were all having a good time, I couldn't help but feel that I was the most interesting person in the room. During the evening, there was a moment when everyone was sharing funny stories about their lives. I decided to share a really embarrassing story about my friend Sarah, who was sitting right next to me. It was a story from high school where she tripped and fell in front of her crush. I thought it would be hilarious, and everyone would laugh together.

Instead, Sarah looked really uncomfortable, and the laughter quickly faded. I brushed it off and just kept talking about how funny it was, thinking maybe she was just shy. A few people tried to change the subject, but I continued to joke about it, thinking I was just being entertaining. 

Later that night, I overheard Sarah telling another friend that she was really embarrassed and hurt by what I said. I felt a bit bad, but I figured it was all in good fun, and she should just lighten up. I didn't apologize, thinking it would only make it worse. So, now I’m left wondering if I was really in the wrong. Am I the asshole for making a joke at my friend's expense?",669,1571,0.55,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_60914,2020-10-06 00:00:00,YTA,1186,AITA

I wanted to cheer him up, so I planned a surprise party with a few of our mutual friends. However, I didn't ask him if he wanted a party or if he was up for socializing. I just assumed it would be good for him to be around people and have some fun.

When the day came, he looked overwhelmed as soon as he walked in and saw all of us there. I thought he would be happy, but he just seemed stressed and upset. I tried to get him to join in and have a good time, but he kept saying he wasn't in the mood and just wanted some space. I dismissed his feelings and insisted that he needed to enjoy himself and let loose. Eventually, he ended up leaving early, and I felt like he was overreacting.

Afterward, I confronted him about it, saying I was just trying to do something nice for him and that he should be grateful. He told me that I should have respected his feelings and asked him what he wanted instead of forcing my idea of fun on him.

You're the Asshole,"Throwaway account. I just need to get this off my chest and see if I’m in the wrong.

Context: 
I've been dating my girlfriend for about a year now. We both have decent jobs and live together, but we’ve always kept our finances separate. I make significantly more than she does, roughly three times her salary. We usually handle our own expenses, and I thought that worked fine for us.

Issue:

Recently, I decided to take a weekend trip to a luxury resort. I’ve been wanting to treat myself after a tough few months at work, and I figured I could afford it without it affecting our finances. I booked the trip and paid for everything upfront — the hotel, spa treatments, and activities. I even bought some nice meals and experiences, thinking it would be a great escape for me.

When I told my girlfriend about it, she seemed upset. She said that I should have consulted her since we live together and share our lives, even if we keep our finances separate. I honestly didn’t see the problem. I told her that it was my money, and I deserved to treat myself. I even suggested she could join me if she wanted, but she said she couldn’t afford to take off work as she’s been busy with her job.

I thought I was being responsible with my finances and simply enjoying what I’ve earned. Now I'm wondering if I should have included her in the decision or asked for her opinion first. Am I the asshole for not consulting her and just going ahead with my plans? I really thought it was a personal choice, but now I’m not so sure.",193,2622,0.69,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_14139,2022-06-17 00:00:00,YTA,1521,AITA
You're the Asshole,"My friend Jake recently got engaged, and I couldn't be happier for him. However, there's a situation that's been bothering me, and I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong for how I've handled it.

Jake and his fiancée, Lisa, are starting to plan their wedding, and they've been sharing ideas with a small group of close friends, including me. During one of our conversations, Lisa mentioned that she had always dreamed of having a winter wedding with a snow-themed color palette—think blues, whites, and silvers. I thought it was a beautiful idea.

Now, here’s where I might have gone wrong: I casually mentioned that my own wedding (which is still just an idea in my mind, no plans yet) would also have a winter theme. I didn’t go into detail, but I said that I’d love to have a similar color scheme. I thought it was just a friendly conversation, but Lisa’s face fell when she heard it.

A few days later, Lisa texted me and said she felt uncomfortable with me wanting to use the same theme for my hypothetical wedding. She said she had envisioned this special day for years, and it felt wrong to her that I would want to do something similar. I kind of brushed it off, thinking she was being a bit dramatic.

When I saw them again, I jokingly mentioned that I could change my mind and go for something else if it bothered her so much. But honestly, I don’t think I should have to change my ideas for a wedding I haven’t even planned. It’s not like I was trying to copy her; I just happened to like the same ideas.

Now I’m questioning whether I overstepped by mentioning my own future wedding dreams in the first place. Am I the asshole for bringing it up and not being more considerate of her feelings?",463,2095,0.93,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_74748,2018-12-15 00:00:00,YTA,1699,AITA
You're the Asshole,"My sister recently had a baby, and during her pregnancy, she really struggled with weight gain. I supported her throughout the process, and she seemed to be doing well. After the baby was born, she joined a new mothers' group to get back on track with her health. One of the things they emphasized was cooking healthy meals and staying active.

I’ve always been into fitness and healthy eating, so I thought I could help her out. She asked for suggestions, and I offered to cook a few meals for her and the baby. But when I started preparing the meals, I noticed she wasn't sticking to the guidelines her group recommended. She would snack on sweets and order takeout when she said she was trying to eat better.

One day, I went over to her place with a batch of healthy meals I had prepared. I thought it would help her stay motivated. When I arrived, I found her munching on a giant slice of chocolate cake while scrolling through her phone. I tried to be supportive, but I couldn't help but comment on her choice. I said something like, ""You know, that cake isn't really going to help you reach your goals.""

She got defensive and said she was allowed to treat herself once in a while. I rolled my eyes and suggested that if she really wanted to get back in shape, she needed to be more disciplined. I then went on to lecture her about portion sizes and how she should really focus on cooking more at home instead of ordering takeout.

Afterwards, she told me I was making her feel bad about her choices and that I was being overbearing. I thought I was just being honest and trying to help her, but now I’m wondering if I overstepped.

You're the Asshole,"So I’ve been in a pretty confusing situation with my roommate, and I think I might be the asshole here, so I wanted to get some outside opinions.

For context, I’m a 28-year-old guy and my roommate, Mike, is 27. We’ve been living together for almost a year now, and we generally get along well. However, there’s one thing that’s been bothering me lately. Mike has a pet cat that he adores, and while I don’t mind cats, I’m not a huge fan of them being all over the place, especially in the kitchen and on the furniture. 

I’m a pretty neat and tidy person. I like to keep things clean, and I really can’t stand the thought of cat hair getting all over my stuff. So, I finally brought it up to Mike during one of our casual discussions about living arrangements. I told him that I think he should keep the cat out of the kitchen and off the couch, especially since I don’t want to find hair all over my food or clothes.

Instead of understanding my perspective, Mike got really defensive. He said that the cat is part of his life and that I should just deal with it. I understand that he loves his cat, but I feel like I have a right to a clean living space too. In response to his defensiveness, I decided to make a point—every time I found cat hair on my stuff, I would just leave it in his room as some kind of protest.

Looking back, I realize that my actions were probably over the top and selfish. I don’t think I handled the situation well at all, and it’s created tension between us. I do want him to understand my feelings, but I might have taken it too far.

After a minute or two, she turned to the barista and said she'd have to leave without her drink because she couldn’t find it. 

Feeling generous, I decided to offer to pay for her coffee. She looked taken aback but gratefully accepted my offer, and we struck up a brief conversation about how hectic mornings can be. She ordered a fancy drink that cost almost double what I normally spend, but I was feeling good about my kind gesture.

After she got her drink, she thanked me again and left. I felt proud of myself until the barista, who overheard our conversation, gave me a disapproving look and said, ""You know she probably just wanted a free drink, right?"" I shrugged it off, thinking I had done something nice.

Later, I overheard the woman talking to her friends outside the café, and she started laughing about how she ""played the nice guy"" to get a free coffee. I felt embarrassed and a bit angry. I decided to confront her and told her I didn't appreciate being made a fool of. She just smiled and said she was just having fun.

To motivate ourselves, we decided to have a friendly competition: whoever could close the most deals by the end of the quarter would win a weekend getaway trip.

As the competition progressed, I started to feel the pressure to win. I noticed that one of my coworkers, Alex, was really close to me in terms of numbers. In a moment of desperation, I decided to sabotage Alex’s chances. I overheard him talking about a potential deal with a client, and instead of congratulating him, I reached out to that client pretending to be Alex and gave them misinformation about the deal to throw him off.

My tactic worked temporarily; Alex lost that deal, and I ended up winning the competition. I felt a rush of excitement when I received the prize. However, the victory felt hollow. A few weeks later, my manager called me in for a meeting and confronted me about my actions after the client expressed confusion over the communication.

Now, I’m facing possible disciplinary action for my unethical behavior. I’ve been reflecting on what I did, and I realize it was wrong. But at the same time, I feel like everyone else in the office was also trying to win, even if they weren’t willing to go to my lengths.

You're the Asshole,"Okay, so my daughter turned 16 last week, and she’s been super excited about her birthday party. She planned everything weeks in advance, invited her friends, and even chose a theme. I was really happy for her and wanted to make the day special. 

Now, a bit of backstory: my daughter has always been a responsible kid. She gets good grades, plays soccer, and has a close-knit group of friends. Lately, though, she’s been spending a lot of time on social media and has started to become more influenced by popular trends, which I’ve noticed has affected her behavior a bit. She’s been a little more sassy and has been texting during family dinners, which we’ve talked about.

Fast forward to the day of the party. I had planned a surprise for her—her favorite cake and a special gift. But when I saw her and her friends taking selfies and posting them online, I felt a bit annoyed. I decided to confront her about it during the party. I told her that she was being rude and that her friends were just using her for the likes. I said I was disappointed in her for not being present and that her priorities seemed off.

In the heat of the moment, I ended up embarrassing her in front of her friends. I called her out for being “too obsessed with social media” and said she was acting like a ""fake influencer"" instead of enjoying her birthday. I could see her friends were uncomfortable, and she looked really hurt. 

After the party, my daughter was upset and didn’t talk to me for a few days. I feel bad for ruining her moment, but I thought I was just trying to teach her a lesson about being present.

You're the Asshole,"I live in a small apartment with my partner and another roommate. We all share the common areas and have our own private spaces. Our roommate, let's call her Sarah, has been living with us for about a year now. 

Sarah is generally a great roommate, but she has a habit of leaving the common areas a bit messy. This has always been a mild annoyance for both me and my partner, but we usually just clean up after her without saying anything. However, it’s been getting worse lately, and I've found myself increasingly frustrated.

Last week, after a particularly long day at work, I came home to find the living room in complete disarray. There were dirty dishes, crumbs everywhere, and it looked like a tornado had hit. I snapped and decided to confront Sarah. I went into her room without knocking and started yelling at her about how inconsiderate she was and how tired I was of cleaning up after her. 

I was really harsh, saying things like “you’re such a slob” and “you don’t care about the rest of us at all.” Sarah looked shocked and hurt, and she tried to defend herself by explaining that she had been busy with work and didn’t realize it had gotten so messy. I didn’t want to hear it and just kept berating her until she left the apartment in tears.

The next day, Sarah texted me saying she needed some space and that she felt really uncomfortable living with me now. My partner agreed that my reaction was over the top, but I brushed it off, thinking that she just needed to toughen up.

So, I (28M) have a group of friends I go out with regularly. We’ve been close for years, and I really enjoy our time together. Recently, we decided to go out for a birthday celebration for one of our friends, Sarah (27F). We planned to hit a popular restaurant and then go to a bar afterward.

The day of the birthday, I had a lot on my mind. I’m dealing with some personal issues, and honestly, I wasn't feeling up to going out, but I didn't want to ruin the plans for Sarah. I decided I would just show up, keep it low-key, and maybe leave a bit early.

I organized everything without telling her, including getting a venue, decorations, and inviting all her friends and family. The only person I consulted was her sister, who was totally on board and helped me with the planning. I put a lot of effort into it, and I was really excited to see her reaction.

He’s rude, dismissive of her friends, and I just don’t think he treats her well. I told her sister that I didn’t want him at the party because it was supposed to be a celebration of her with people who genuinely care about her.

A few years ago, my girlfriend surprised me with a rare game that I had been searching for. I was so excited to have it in my collection, and I promised myself I would take great care of it. 

Fast forward to a few months ago, we broke up. It was an amicable split, but I still had to return a few of her things, including some of the gifts she gave me. I gave her back the things that were important to her, but when it came to the game, I decided to keep it. I told myself that since I was so emotionally attached to it, it was only fair that I kept it, especially since she didn’t seem to care that much about it.

Recently, my ex reached out to me, asking for the game back. She said it was a sentimental piece for her because it reminded her of the time we spent together. I brushed it off and told her I had lost it, which was a complete lie. I knew I should have just given it back, but I really didn’t want to part with it. 

Now, I feel bad because I know I should have just returned it to her. I’ve been secretly enjoying the game while feeling guilty at the same time. My friends think I’m being ridiculous for not giving it back, but I keep justifying it by saying I loved it first. 

So, AITA for keeping the game that my ex gave me?",42,1465,0.59,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_11976,2020-02-06 00:00:00,YTA,1340,AITA
You're the Asshole,"So, I (19M) have a younger brother (15M) who is really into video games. I’ve always been supportive of his interests, but I’m also a bit of a gamer myself. Recently, he got really into this popular online game and has been spending a ton of time playing it, which I thought was fine at first. But then I noticed he was starting to neglect his schoolwork and social life. I mean, he would literally spend entire weekends just glued to his screen.

One day, I decided to poke fun at him during dinner, mentioning how he was basically turning into a zombie. I thought it was just playful teasing, but he took it really hard. He got super defensive and said he was just having fun and that I wouldn’t understand because I had a different childhood. I honestly didn't think much of it at the time and kept insisting he needed to find a balance. 

A few days later, I saw that he was still playing the game a lot, so I thought it would be a good idea to confront him again. I told him he was wasting his life and that he should be focusing on more important things like his future and not just sitting in front of a screen all day. I wanted him to see that I was looking out for him, but he ended up getting really upset and said I was being a bully. I told him he was being overly sensitive and that I was just trying to help him.

Later, he confided in our parents about how I was treating him, and they told me I was being harsh and should apologize. But I honestly don’t think I did anything wrong; I just wanted to motivate him to be better. 

Now I'm stuck feeling like I’m in the wrong for caring about his future, which is frustrating. So, AITA for how I handled the situation with my brother?",54,1327,0.94,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_22440,2023-11-08 00:00:00,YTA,1696,AITA

I was really looking forward to it because we always have a great time together. However, I had a big exam the day before the party, and I had barely studied for it. I decided that I needed to prioritize my education over going out and having fun.

When I told my friend that I couldn't make it to the party because I needed to study, she was upset. She said I was being a ""bad friend"" and that I was missing out on a chance to celebrate with her and our other friends. I thought I was being responsible, but now it seems like everyone is against me. My other friends started texting me, saying I should at least come for a little while to show my support, but I just couldn't do it. I felt like I would be distracted and not be able to focus on studying.

Now, it feels like I've ruined everything. My friend is taking it personally, and she even posted on social media about how ""some people just don't care about friendships."" It has made me feel awful, but I still think I did the right thing by putting my studies first. I can't believe they are all acting like I'm some kind of villain for wanting to do well in school.

Recently, one of my friends, Sarah, has been really struggling financially. She mentioned that she’s been trying to save money, and I completely understand that. However, when I suggested that we could just do a potluck dinner at someone's house instead of going out, Sarah got really upset. She told me that she didn't want to feel like a burden and that she would feel bad if we all had to change our plans just for her.

I didn't think much of it at the time, so I went ahead and organized a dinner at a restaurant anyway. I even posted about it in our group chat, making it clear that I was excited to go out and catch up. When Sarah saw the message, she said she wouldn’t come because she felt uncomfortable about not being able to afford it, and I told her it was no big deal, she could just order something small. 

Honestly, I felt annoyed. I thought she was being overly sensitive and should just enjoy the time with friends instead of worrying about money. It’s not like I’m rich or anything; I just like to treat myself every once in a while.

Things have been going well overall, but I’ve been feeling a bit insecure about her friendships with some of her male coworkers. I know they’re just friends, but sometimes I get this nagging feeling that she might like one of them more than just a friend.

A few weeks ago, we were hanging out at her place when her phone buzzed. I picked it up to see who it was, and it was a text from one of those male coworkers. I don’t know what came over me, but I opened the message without thinking and read it. It was harmless, just a joke about work, but I felt a surge of jealousy anyway.

In that moment, I decided to confront her about it. I told her that I didn’t like her hanging out with him and that I wanted her to stop texting him. She was taken aback and told me that I was being unreasonable since they work together and she values her friendships. I didn’t back down, though. I insisted that if she truly cared about me, she would want to make me feel secure and respected my feelings.

After our argument, she agreed to limit her communication with him, but she seemed upset. It’s been a few days, and she hasn’t really been the same since. I think I was just trying to protect our relationship, but now I feel guilty for pushing her to cut off friendships.

Recently, she asked me to be her maid of honor, which I was thrilled about at first. However, as the wedding planning progressed, I started feeling overwhelmed by the expectations. Jess wanted everything to be perfect, and she often turned to me for help with ideas, organizing events, and dealing with family drama. I ended up spending a lot of time and money on things that I didn’t really want to be involved in.

Last week, Jess had a bridal shower that I organized for her. I spent hours planning every detail, trying to make it special. However, when the day came, I just wasn’t feeling it. I was exhausted and felt like I was losing my own identity in all of this. When Jess opened her gifts, I noticed she didn’t seem as excited as I had hoped. I felt frustrated and blurted out in front of everyone, “If you’re not going to appreciate this, maybe you don’t deserve it.”

The room went silent, and Jess looked hurt. I immediately realized how harsh that sounded and tried to backtrack, but the damage was done. My sister ended up leaving the party in tears, and I felt terrible afterward. I thought I was just being honest, but now I see I might have crossed a line.

I still think it was important to express my feelings, but I can’t shake the feeling that I was an asshole for saying it in front of everyone.

A few weeks ago, Emily invited us over for dinner to celebrate her engagement. She was excited and had put a lot of effort into cooking. I thought it would be funny to make a few jokes about how she used to be a terrible cook when we were kids, like the time she burned the mac and cheese and set off the fire alarm. I meant it all in good fun, and I thought it would lighten the mood.

However, I didn’t realize how much pressure she was under to impress her fiancé and his family, who were also invited. After my jokes, I noticed she went quiet and her fiancé looked uncomfortable. I brushed it off, thinking they would get over it.

Later in the evening, Emily pulled me aside and told me that I was ruining her special moment with my jokes. I was taken aback and thought she was overreacting. I told her she needed to lighten up and that it was all in good fun. I even said, “You know I love you, right? I’m just trying to keep things fun!”

After that, she seemed really upset, and I could tell she was close to tears. I thought maybe she was just being overly sensitive, but I didn’t apologize because I didn’t think I did anything wrong. The rest of the evening was tense, and I could see that my jokes had really put a damper on things.

After the dinner, I got a message from her fiancé saying that I needed to be more considerate of Emily's feelings. I felt attacked and thought he was overstepping, so I shot back that they should just learn to take a joke. Emily hasn’t spoken to me since, and I’m starting to feel bad about the whole situation.

A few months ago, I was planning a big birthday party for myself. I had booked a venue, organized a caterer, and even arranged for a live band. It was going to be a big celebration, and I was really excited about it. Sarah, who is usually super supportive and always helps me with my events, was also looking forward to it.

I felt bad for her and wanted to be there for her, but I was also focused on my party planning. Instead of offering to help her, I suggested that she should come to my party and have a good time to take her mind off things.

On the day of my party, Sarah seemed distant and not really in the mood to celebrate. I tried to cheer her up, but she just sat in a corner and didn’t engage much with anyone. At some point during the night, I got frustrated. I felt like she was ruining my party with her negative energy. So, I made a comment in front of our friends, saying, “Sarah, it’s my birthday! Can you try to have fun for once? You’re bringing everyone down!”

After that, she stormed out. I thought maybe she just needed some space. The next day, she texted me saying that my comment was really hurtful and that I was being selfish for expecting her to just put her problems aside for my celebration. I was taken aback; I honestly thought I was just trying to encourage her.

We haven’t spoken much since then, and I feel like I've lost a good friend over this. My other friends have mixed opinions, some say I should apologize, while others say I was just being honest. I feel like I was just frustrated because I wanted everyone to have a good time, including her.

Recently, I got a promotion at work, and Sarah was really excited for me. She insisted on taking me out to celebrate at a fancy restaurant that I had mentioned wanting to try.

The night of the celebration, I was excited, but when we got there, I realized that it was way more expensive than I anticipated. I offered to pay for my meal, but Sarah insisted on covering everything since it was a celebration for me. I felt uncomfortable but didn't want to ruin the night, so I graciously accepted.

After dinner, we decided to order dessert, and I was quite full, but Sarah insisted I try the chocolate lava cake, which I had also mentioned wanting to try. I ended up eating more than I should have. The bill came, and it was surprisingly high—about $250 for both of us. Sarah paid for it without blinking an eye, but I felt really guilty about it.

The next day, I texted her to thank her for the dinner and mentioned that I felt bad about her paying for everything. She said it was her treat and that she was happy to celebrate my success. I then jokingly suggested that I should treat her to dinner next time, but then I realized that I couldn’t really afford to go to the same place again. 

Instead of just saying that, I went ahead and suggested we go to a more expensive restaurant again for my treat. Sarah was excited and said yes, but I then followed up by saying I’d cover my meal and she could cover hers.

I (28M) have a younger sister (25F) who is getting married soon. She's been engaged for about a year now, and I couldn't be happier for her. She's been planning her dream wedding for months and has been really excited about it. The problem started when she asked me to be her best man.

At first, I was flattered and accepted immediately. Then, I realized that being a best man comes with responsibilities that I didn’t really want to deal with. I’m not really a social person and the thought of giving a speech in front of a crowd makes me want to throw up. I also didn’t really want to deal with all the wedding planning stuff, like organizing the bachelor party or running errands. 

So, instead of being honest with her about my feelings, I decided to take the easy route. I just started ignoring her calls and texts about wedding planning. I thought if I avoided the topic long enough, she would just find someone else to take my place. I figured she could just ask one of her friends who are more into that kind of stuff anyway.

Fast forward a few months, and she finally confronted me about my lack of involvement. She was hurt and upset that I hadn’t been supportive or present during her wedding preparations. I played it off, saying I was just busy with work and life, but deep down I knew I was just avoiding the situation. Eventually, she ended up asking one of her friends to step in as best man, which made me feel guilty, but I still didn't admit my fault.

This year, my friend Sarah (28F) is turning 30, and we decided to throw her a surprise party. We all chipped in to make it special, and I was in charge of the decorations and cake.

I felt really overwhelmed because I wanted to show my support for Jess, too, but I couldn’t afford to contribute much to both events.

The party was a huge success, and Sarah was thrilled. Everyone raved about how great it was, and I felt proud of what I had done.

I was taken aback because I thought we could celebrate both without one being less important.

In my mind, Jess's wedding was still weeks away, and birthdays are a yearly thing. I told her that she was being overly dramatic and that it was just a party. I even suggested that she should have planned her wedding on a different date if she wanted exclusive attention. Jess was really hurt, and I think I may have crossed the line when I said that.

I brushed it off at first, thinking she was being overly sensitive. But it kept bothering me, so I decided to make a joke about it in front of our team. I said something like, ""Don’t worry, Sarah, I’ll keep my fabulousness in check for you!” The team laughed, but Sarah just rolled her eyes and walked away looking upset.

You're the Asshole,"A few months ago, my daughter (10F) was diagnosed with a disability that affects her mobility. It was a tough time for our family, and we’ve been trying to make adjustments to help her feel comfortable and supported. My wife and I have been very proactive in finding resources and therapies for her.

My sister, however, has been less than supportive. She tends to make jokes about disabilities and often refers to her kids as “normal” compared to my daughter. This has always bothered me, but I never confronted her directly, thinking she would change her attitude over time. But the more I hear her comments, the more frustrated I become.

Recently, we had a family gathering, and my sister brought her kids over. During the event, she made a joke about how her kids would ""never be like my poor daughter."" I was furious and called her out in front of everyone. I told her that her comments were hurtful and disrespectful. Instead of apologizing, she got defensive and said I was being overly sensitive and that I needed to lighten up.

After that, our family was divided. Some sided with me, while others thought I overreacted and that my sister was just joking. I felt justified because I was standing up for my daughter, but I realize now I could have handled it differently. I might have embarrassed her in front of everyone, and it has caused tension in the family.

My wife has since told me that while my sister's comments were hurtful, my confrontation may have been too harsh.

Last week, we went to dinner at a nice restaurant, and I ordered a lot of food and drinks. My friends were sharing a few appetizers, but I didn’t really want to share. When the bill came, I noticed it was split evenly among us. I felt like I should only pay for what I ordered since I took up more of the bill with my choices. 

When I suggested that we should pay for what each of us had, my friends were a bit taken aback. They said it was customary to split the bill, and I was being really cheap. I insisted that it wasn’t fair for me to pay for someone else’s food when I ordered so much more. I tried to justify my behavior by saying that it was just about being fair, but it felt like I was making the mood awkward for everyone.

In the end, I paid the full split bill, but I felt annoyed that my friends didn’t see my point. I might have come off as rude or inconsiderate in the way I pushed for this. Looking back, I can see that I was being a bit selfish and not thinking about the time we usually enjoy together.

She practices all the time and even plays in a local youth orchestra. Recently, she got an opportunity to perform in a big concert, and she was really excited about it.

Now, I’ve never been a huge fan of classical music, and I don’t really think playing the violin is that impressive compared to other instruments, like the guitar or piano. One day, while we were having a family gathering, she was talking about her upcoming performance, and I jokingly said, “Why don’t you try playing something cooler, like an electric guitar? Violin’s pretty boring.” I thought it would be funny, but she looked hurt.

Instead of backing down, I doubled down and said, “Honestly, how many people actually enjoy listening to violin music? It’s just not as fun as other instruments.” She got really upset and walked away, and other family members started giving me weird looks.

Later on, my aunt pulled me aside and said that I should be more supportive of my cousin’s passion. I brushed it off, thinking it was just a joke that went too far. But the more I think about it, the more I realize I probably hurt her feelings over something that’s really important to her.

You're the Asshole,"So a little background info: 

I've been living with my best friend, Alex, since I moved to a new city for work six months ago. Alex is great, but she has a younger brother, Jason, who's 10. Jason is a good kid, but he's got a lot of energy and can be quite annoying at times. He’s always bouncing around, asking questions, and making noise, which can be distracting when I'm trying to unwind after a long day at work.

Recently, Alex’s family decided to throw a birthday party for Jason at their house, and they invited a bunch of his friends over. I planned to be out of the house during the party to avoid the chaos, but Alex insisted I stay. She said it would mean a lot to Jason if I was there, and I didn’t want to disappoint her.

During the party, I tried to be polite and engage with the kids, but honestly, I was just overwhelmed. Jason and his friends were running around, screaming, and throwing balloons everywhere. At one point, Jason came up to me with a handful of cake and smashed it into my face, laughing hysterically. The other kids thought it was hilarious, but I didn’t. I felt disrespected and annoyed, so I snapped at him in front of everyone, telling him he was being a brat and needed to grow up. 

After that, things got awkward. Jason looked hurt, and the laughter died down pretty quickly. Alex pulled me aside and told me I overreacted and embarrassed her brother. I shrugged it off, thinking he needed to learn a lesson about boundaries. 

I ended up leaving the party early, and Alex texted me later saying that Jason was really upset and that I should apologize. I refused, arguing that he should know better than to throw cake at people. I felt justified because I thought I was teaching him a lesson about respect. 

In the days following, Alex has been distant, and I can tell she’s upset with me. I thought I was just being honest and standing up for myself, but now I’m starting to wonder if I was too harsh.

My (28F) sister (30F) has two kids, ages 4 and 6. I love my sister, but her parenting style is very different from what I would consider normal. Her kids are wild, and they often run around screaming and causing chaos wherever they go. I’ve seen them in family gatherings, and they seem to have no boundaries. They can be very loud, and they don’t listen to their mom when she tells them to calm down. 

I’m getting married next year, and the venue I chose is quite upscale. We have a lot of elegant decorations, and I want everything to be a bit formal. I’ve been thinking about the atmosphere I want to create for my wedding, and kids running around and making noise really doesn’t fit that vision.

When I told my sister about the wedding, I mentioned that I’d prefer if it were an adult-only event. She got upset and said it’s unfair to not let her bring her kids. I explained my reasoning, emphasizing that I wanted a certain ambiance and that I’m worried her kids wouldn’t behave the way I expect guests to behave at my wedding. I even mentioned that I had a previous experience where her kids knocked over a cake at a family party, which traumatized me because it was such a mess.

Despite my explanation, my sister is still insisting that I’m being unreasonable and that family should be able to bring their kids to weddings. She has even suggested that I should consider how important this is for her and that it’s not just about me.

I realized that the wedding planning was a huge deal for them, so I tried to keep my feelings to myself for a while.

You're the Asshole,"I recently started a new job at a small office, and I share a workspace with a couple of my coworkers. Last week, I noticed that one of my coworkers, Lisa, had a personal mug that she kept on her desk. It was cute and seemed important to her, but it looked like it needed a good cleaning.

One day, I decided to take matters into my own hands and cleaned the mug without asking her. I figured I was just being helpful, but I didn't realize how much of a personal item it was to her. When Lisa came back to her desk and noticed that her mug was clean, she seemed a bit off and asked me if I had touched it. I told her that I thought I was doing her a favor and wanted to help keep the workspace tidy.

She got visibly upset and said that it was a special gift from her grandmother and that she preferred to clean it herself. I didn’t see why she was making such a big deal out of it. I told her that I was just trying to be nice and that she shouldn’t be so sensitive about it. I felt justified in my actions because I was trying to contribute to a clean work environment.

Now, a few of my other coworkers think that I overstepped and that I should have asked Lisa first before touching her belongings. I still think I did nothing wrong; I was just trying to be helpful.

You're the Asshole,"So, this happened a few days ago, and I’ve been thinking about it a lot, so I wanted to share it here.

I live in a small apartment complex where we have a pretty tight-knit community. There’s a community garden that we all share, and I’ve been really invested in it lately. I planted a bunch of vegetables, and I’ve been watering and tending to them regularly. I even put up a little sign with my name on it to let everyone know whose garden it is.

Now, there’s this new neighbor who just moved in a couple of weeks ago. I noticed she started picking some of my vegetables without asking. At first, I thought maybe she didn’t realize they were mine, so I decided to let it slide. But then, she took a whole bunch of tomatoes while I was out there working one day. I confronted her about it, and she said she thought it was a community garden and that she could take whatever she wanted.

I got really frustrated and snapped at her, saying that it was my hard work that made the garden what it is. I told her she should’ve asked me first before taking anything. She looked taken aback, and I could see she felt bad, but I was too upset to care at that moment.

A few days later, I decided to host a small gathering with some neighbors, and I made a point to not invite her. I figured if she was going to take my vegetables without asking, she didn’t deserve to join in our fun. Some of my other neighbors asked why she wasn’t invited, and I told them about what happened. They seemed to think I was being a bit harsh.

Now I’m feeling guilty. Maybe I overreacted and should have approached the situation differently. AITA?",699,1528,0.76,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_22192,2024-08-12 00:00:00,YTA,1623,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I recently hosted a small dinner party at my apartment and invited a few close friends. One of my friends, Sarah, mentioned that she was on a tight budget lately, so I offered to cover her meal to help her out. I thought it would be nice to treat her since we’ve known each other for years.

However, when it came time to split the cost of drinks, I suggested that since I covered Sarah’s meal, she should pay for her share of the drinks, which ended up being about $30. Sarah seemed a bit taken aback and said she didn’t think it was fair to pay for drinks when I already covered her meal. I insisted that it was only fair since I was covering her meal to be generous, and splitting the drinks would make it even. 

The atmosphere got a little tense, but I felt I was being reasonable. I pointed out that I had invited everyone, and they should contribute something, even if it was just for drinks. Sarah eventually agreed to pay, but I could tell she was upset about it.

After the party, I started to think about whether I was being too pushy. I had a good financial situation and could have easily covered the whole evening without needing anyone to chip in. But I felt it was about fairness and everyone contributing. My other friends didn’t seem to have an issue with it, so I thought I was in the right.

We’ve been living together for about a year, and he’s always been pretty messy. I’m more of a clean freak, and it drives me nuts when dishes pile up in the sink or when there’s garbage everywhere.

A few weeks ago, I reached my breaking point. I came home from work after a long day to find the apartment in complete disarray. There were dirty dishes stacked up, food containers left out, and the garbage hadn’t been taken out for at least a week. I tried talking to him about it nicely, but he shrugged it off like it wasn’t a big deal.

So, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I packed up all of his stuff that was lying around—clothes, gaming equipment, you name it—and put it all in garbage bags. I then left them outside the front door with a note saying he could pick them up when he felt like cleaning up after himself.

He was furious when he got home and saw what I had done. He confronted me, and I told him that I was tired of living in a pigsty and that he needed to learn a lesson. He said I overreacted and that it wasn’t my place to throw out his things, even if they weren’t technically in the apartment.

I still think I did the right thing because I can’t live in a mess, but now I feel guilty. Everyone keeps telling me that I went too far. AITA for trying to teach him a lesson about cleaning up after himself?",356,2077,0.53,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_55201,2018-06-26 00:00:00,YTA,1466,AITA

I’ve known them for years, and while I’m not particularly fond of kids, I try to be supportive of my friend and her parenting. Recently, Sarah asked me if I could babysit Lily for a night while she and her husband had a much-needed date night. I agreed, thinking it would be a good way to help my friend out.

However, when Lily arrived, I was immediately overwhelmed. She was excited and full of energy, and I wasn’t really prepared for that. I had planned to just watch a movie and relax, but it quickly became clear that Lily wanted to play and do activities instead. I got frustrated and decided to just put on my favorite movie, “The Matrix,” thinking it would keep her entertained. 

I didn’t really pay attention to the fact that the movie is rated R and has some intense scenes. When Lily started to ask questions about the violence and the themes, I got annoyed and told her to just watch it and not think so much. I didn’t want to pause the movie, as I was really invested in it. 

When Sarah came home, she was furious. She said that I should have been more considerate of Lily’s age and the content of the movie, and that I should have engaged with her instead of just using the movie as a babysitter. I felt defensive and told her I was just trying to have a fun night. 

Now I’m questioning whether I overreacted. I thought I was doing my friend a favor, but maybe I should have been more responsible. Am I the asshole for showing her an inappropriate movie and not engaging with her more?",873,2587,0.93,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_25777,2021-11-20 00:00:00,YTA,1560,AITA

I made a big deal out of the party, preparing special treats for both my friends and the puppy. I even bought a cake with a cute dog design on it. I thought it would be a great way to show off my puppy and have a fun time with my friends.

However, the day of the party, my best friend called me to say she couldn't make it because her grandmother had passed away the day before. She was understandably upset and needed to be with her family during this time. I was shocked, but I still told her I completely understood and that I would see her soon.

Feeling disappointed that she wouldn’t be there, I decided to make a big announcement during the party. I told everyone that we should all take a moment to remember my friend’s grandmother and that I would be dedicating the puppy's cake to her.

When my friends were coming over, I noticed some were uncomfortable with the idea, but I insisted. I even made a toast to my friend's grandmother, and then we proceeded to cut the cake. I thought it would be a nice gesture and that my friend would appreciate it, even if she wasn't there.

Later, I shared some pictures of the party and the puppy cake on social media, and my friend saw them. She was hurt and upset that I had used her loss as a backdrop for my celebration. She confronted me, saying it was in poor taste, and I didn't understand why she was so upset.

Recently, we went to a birthday party for one of her son’s friends. The party was at a local amusement park, and all the kids were having a blast. I noticed that my girlfriend was letting her son eat whatever he wanted, including a ton of candy and junk food. To me, this felt excessive, especially since I’ve been trying to encourage healthier eating habits for both of them. 

During the party, I called her aside and said, ""Hey, maybe we should consider limiting the junk food a bit. It’s not great for him to have so much sugar."" She got really defensive and said it was just a birthday party, and it was a one-time thing. 

Later, when I saw her son with a huge bag of cotton candy, I couldn't help myself. I told the kid, ""You know, too much sugar is really bad for you, right? You should save some for later.""

I was really excited to spend some quality time with him and thought it would be a great opportunity to bond. My sister, his mother, was a bit hesitant at first, but I assured her I would keep a close eye on him and that it would be a safe and fun experience.

When we arrived at the cabin, I had planned a bunch of outdoor activities, like fishing, hiking, and some campfire storytelling. However, I also brought along my video game console and a selection of games, thinking it would be nice to have some downtime in the evenings. I figured he would enjoy it, and I didn’t think much of it.

The first night, after a long day of activities, I suggested we play some of the games together. He seemed really excited and we ended up playing for a few hours. However, I noticed that a few of the games I had brought were rated M for Mature. I had played them before and thought they were just really fun to share. I didn’t consider the content too deeply.

As we played, I realized that some of the language and themes in the games were not appropriate for him. He was laughing and having a good time, but I started to feel uneasy. By the second night, I decided to let him stay up late and we played even more. I didn’t think it was a big deal since I was his uncle, and I felt like I was being cool by letting him play the games.

When we returned home, my sister was furious. She had no idea he had been playing those games and was upset with me for exposing him to such content.

As the wedding date approached, Lily invited me to help plan the bachelor party for her fiancé. I thought this was a great opportunity to bond and decided to take charge of the planning. However, I have a pretty wild side and thought it would be fun to throw a raucous party with a lot of drinking and some questionable choices. I didn't really take Lily's wishes into account, thinking she’d be fine with it since it was for her fiancé.

I ended up booking a weekend getaway to a party town, rented a large house, and invited several friends along, including some people the fiancé didn’t even know that well.

A few weeks ago, I was working on a big project for my company that required some graphic design work. I thought it would be a good opportunity to help my sister out and support her career. So, I reached out and asked if she’d be interested in doing some designs for me. I framed it as a collaboration, hoping it would also help her build her portfolio.

She was excited at first but quickly started to complain about the timeline, saying she had other clients and that she didn’t want to feel rushed. I assured her that I could be flexible, but I also needed the work done by a certain date. I think I might have pushed her too hard on the timeline because, in the end, she didn’t deliver what I was expecting. 

When I saw the designs, I was disappointed. They didn’t fit the vision I had for the project, and I felt like I had been too lenient with my feedback. I ended up hiring a professional designer to redo the work and just paid my sister a small fee for her initial efforts. I thought it was fair, but she was really upset with me. 

She accused me of taking advantage of her and not valuing her work. I was frustrated and told her that if she can’t handle the pressure of a project, maybe she should rethink her career choice.

I was hesitant because I didn’t want to mix family and work, but I agreed to meet with him for coffee to discuss his options. During our conversation, he opened up about his feelings of inadequacy and how he’s struggling to find purpose. While I sympathized, I also couldn’t help but think that he just needed to try harder.

Instead of being supportive, I bluntly told him that he should stop making excuses and actually put in the effort to improve himself.

I (27f) recently started a new job and was really excited about it. I’ve been working hard to prove myself, and I thought I was doing pretty well. The thing is, I tend to get very competitive, especially when it comes to work. I’ve always been like that, but I know I need to tone it down a bit.

One of my colleagues, Sarah (30f), is also new, and we’ve been getting along well. We often collaborate on projects and share ideas. However, I noticed that Sarah was getting more praise from our boss for her contributions, which made me envious.

Last week, we were in a team meeting where we were presenting our ideas for an upcoming project. I noticed that Sarah had put together a really great presentation, and I felt threatened. When it was my turn to present, I made a few comments about her work, suggesting that while she had some good points, she missed a couple of critical aspects that I would have focused on. I could tell it wasn’t taken well, and Sarah looked visibly upset. 

After the meeting, I overheard Sarah talking to a few colleagues, and I could hear her mentioning how hurtful my comments were. I felt a pang of guilt, but I justified it to myself by thinking that I was just trying to assert my own ideas. I thought that maybe being a little tough would help me get noticed more.

He emphasized that collaboration and support are essential for our team and that my comments were not in the spirit of teamwork.

I told her that she couldn’t afford to waste time and that it’s crucial to start working as soon as possible to build her resume. I pointed out that she was lucky to have the opportunity to find a job in a comfortable environment and that many people her age were struggling much harder than she was.

In my excitement to move in, I decided to throw a little housewarming party and invited a bunch of friends over. I didn’t think much about it, but I let Max off his leash in the common area to run around and play. My friends thought it was cute, and Max was having a blast. However, I didn’t realize that there were several families with small children living nearby who were trying to enjoy their own quiet evening.

You're the Asshole,"I'm a 28-year-old guy, and I recently started dating a wonderful woman, Sarah, who has a 5-year-old daughter, Lily. We've been going out for a few months, and things are going really well. Sarah often has Lily with her when we hang out, and I've grown quite fond of her.

Last week, Sarah and I decided to have a little date night at my place, and I thought it would be nice to surprise them both with a fun dinner. I don't have any kids of my own, so I wanted to make the evening special for Lily too. I decided to order pizza and cupcakes, knowing that kids love that stuff.

However, I thought it would be funny to add a little surprise by getting cupcakes that had some adult-themed decorations. I thought, ""It's just a joke; it's not like she'll understand."" So I ordered a dozen cupcakes with some silly, slightly inappropriate designs on them, thinking it would be a cute, playful touch.

When Sarah arrived with Lily, I was anxious to see their reaction. Sarah immediately noticed the cupcakes and was visibly upset. She told me that it was not appropriate for a child and that I should have considered the implications of the decorations. Lily, of course, didn't understand and just thought they looked funny, but Sarah quickly took her aside and explained that those cupcakes weren't for her.

I felt embarrassed and frustrated. I tried to downplay it, saying it was just a joke and that Lily wouldn't be harmed by it. I told Sarah she was overreacting and that I thought it would be fun. I ended up getting into an argument with her about it, insisting that I didn't mean any harm and that she should lighten up.

Now, I can't help but feel like maybe I crossed a line, but I thought it was all in good fun. Was I wrong for trying to make the evening unique, or was Sarah overreacting?",534,2962,0.87,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_97997,2022-08-31 00:00:00,YTA,1796,AITA
You're the Asshole,"My partner and I have been living together for about a year now. We usually share chores around the house, but I’ve noticed that I’ve been doing a lot more than my fair share lately. I work a demanding job while my partner has more flexible hours and tends to have a bit more free time. 

Last week, I came home after a particularly exhausting day, only to find the house in disarray. Dishes were piled up in the sink, laundry was scattered everywhere, and the trash hadn’t been taken out. I was pretty frustrated, so I decided to take a stand. The next day, I didn’t do any chores. I left everything as it was and simply focused on my own work and relaxation.

When my partner came home and saw the mess, they asked me why I wasn’t helping out. I told them that I felt it was only fair since I’ve been doing the majority of the chores lately. I suggested that they should take care of everything since I had been picking up the slack for so long. My partner got upset and said that I was being unreasonable and passive-aggressive. I insisted that it was their turn to step up and handle the responsibilities.

After a few days of this back-and-forth, my partner finally broke down and cleaned everything up. They were clearly frustrated, and I didn't really care because I felt justified in my stance. Looking back, I realize that while I wanted to make a point about sharing the workload, I ended up making my partner feel overwhelmed and stressed.

During the gathering, I noticed that Matt was not really paying attention to Jamie and kept interrupting her when she tried to share her excitement about the wedding plans. 

After the party, I mentioned to Jamie that I was concerned about how Matt treated her. I told her that if he was going to be her husband, he should be more supportive and attentive. Jamie got upset and said I was being overly critical and that she loved Matt for who he was, self-centeredness and all. I pressed on, saying that I thought she deserved someone who would cherish and support her.

A few days later, I decided to take it a step further and texted Jamie that I thought she should really reconsider the engagement if Matt couldn’t show her the love and support she deserved. I thought I was being a good friend by looking out for her, but instead, she called me crying and said I was ruining her happiness by trying to manipulate her feelings about Matt.

For clarity, I (27F) and my boyfriend (28M) have been together for about three years. We’re both really into fitness and often go to the gym together. Recently, we started training for a local half-marathon, which has been really motivating for us both.

A couple of weeks ago, I bought a new pair of running shoes that I was super excited about. They were a little pricey, but I figured they’d be worth the investment. When I came home and showed them to my boyfriend, he made a comment about how he thought they were ""ugly"" and ""not worth the money."" I was a bit taken aback but brushed it off, thinking he was just being playful.

Fast forward to the week of the marathon. I wore my new shoes for the first time at our last training run. I was feeling great and excited to show off my new gear. However, during our run, my boyfriend kept making snide comments about my shoes. He would say things like, ""How are those ugly things treating you?"" and ""Do you think they’re going to hold up for the race?"" At first, I laughed it off, but as we kept running, I started feeling really self-conscious.

After our run, I confronted him about his comments. I told him that it hurt my feelings and that he should support me instead of making fun of my choices. He got defensive and said I was being overly sensitive and that he was just joking around. I ended up snapping at him, telling him that if he couldn’t be supportive, he could just keep his mouth shut.

Now he’s upset with me, saying I overreacted and ruined the fun. I’m starting to feel like maybe I was too harsh on him. AITA for getting upset about his comments on my shoes?",611,1109,0.99,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_21079,2019-05-29 00:00:00,YTA,1684,AITA

However, I have a long-standing tradition in my family where we hold a big family barbecue every summer, and I’ve always been the one to host it. This year, the date of the barbecue happens to fall on the same day as Lily’s wedding. I’ve been looking forward to this barbecue for months, and it’s something that a lot of our extended family members attend. I didn’t want to cancel it, since I’ve always been the one responsible for organizing it, and I thought it might be unfair to everyone else.

So, I told Lily that I wouldn’t be able to make it to the wedding because of my barbecue. I thought she would understand my commitment to family and tradition. Instead, she was really upset and said that it hurt her feelings that I would choose a casual family gathering over her wedding day. I brushed it off and said that it was just one day and that she shouldn't be too upset about it.

Now, I can see that she’s really hurt. Some of my family members are backing her up, saying that I should have prioritized her wedding over the barbecue.

In a moment of frustration, I told her that she should be grateful to Jake for being so successful and that she should just enjoy the benefits of having him in her life. I suggested that she should focus on being more supportive instead of complaining so much. 

Sarah got really quiet and then snapped at me, saying that she didn't want to be dependent on anyone for her happiness or financial security. I tried to explain that I didn’t mean it that way and that I was just trying to encourage her to see things from a different perspective, but she left my house in tears.

When my partner walked in and saw the party, they looked really overwhelmed. They told me they didn’t want a big celebration and preferred a quiet night with just a few close friends. I could see they were upset, but instead of acknowledging their feelings, I insisted that they should just enjoy what I planned because I had worked so hard on it. I argued that it was their birthday and they should just be grateful.

I ended up sulking for the rest of the night when they didn’t seem as excited as I wanted them to be. A couple of friends even suggested we tone it down, but I pushed back, telling them it was too late to change anything. I felt like my partner was being ungrateful and didn’t appreciate all the effort I put in.

My girlfriend and I have been living together for about a year now. We both work full-time jobs, but I’ve been lucky enough to work from home while she has to go into the office. She has a pretty demanding job, and I try to help out where I can, but sometimes I just get absorbed in my work and don’t always notice what’s going on around me.

My girlfriend has a close-knit group of friends, and they often come over for brunch on weekends. Typically, she does all the planning and cooking while I just lounge around. I know I should help more, but I often convince myself that I’m too busy with work or that it’s her “thing” to host.

Recently, she mentioned wanting to redo the living room to make it more inviting for her friends. I thought it was a good idea, but I didn’t really get involved in the planning. Instead, I focused on my work and let her handle it all. When she started picking out new furniture and decor, I was indifferent and just told her I trusted her judgment.

The other day, she invited a few friends over to check out the new living room setup. I thought it would be just a casual gathering, but she had gone all out with decorations, snacks, and drinks. I was surprised by how much effort she put in, and I felt guilty for not helping her.

To make matters worse, when her friends arrived, I was still in my pajamas, sitting on the couch, and scrolling through my phone. My girlfriend looked a bit embarrassed and mentioned that I could at least change into something nicer. I snapped and told her that I didn't see the big deal, that I’d been busy with work, and that she should have just asked me to help instead of expecting me to read her mind.

Her friends looked a bit awkward, and after they left, my girlfriend was upset and told me I was being inconsiderate. I told her that it was her choice to host them and that I shouldn't have to feel pressured to help if I didn’t want to. She said I was being selfish and that I should contribute more to our home and relationship.

Now I’m feeling conflicted. AITA for not wanting to participate in hosting and for telling her that she should have asked for help?",127,2854,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_13060,2021-03-05 00:00:00,YTA,2153,AITA

I’m currently saving for my own future and have a lot of expenses, so I suggested we do a small gathering at my apartment and keep things simple. Jess insisted on a big event, with a fancy venue, decorations, and catering, which would cost a lot more. I told her I really couldn’t afford to chip in for that.

So, Jess decided to ask our parents for the extra money to cover her vision. When my parents agreed and contributed, I felt a bit sidelined, especially since I was putting in the effort to help plan. I ended up feeling frustrated that I was doing all the work while my parents were funding her dream shower. I made my feelings known to Jess, and she got upset, saying I was being selfish and that her wedding was a big deal to her. 

In a fit of annoyance, I told her that since I wasn’t financially invested, I didn’t care if she didn’t want to include me in any of the important decisions. I also mentioned that I wouldn’t be attending the shower since it wasn’t my style anyway, which hurt her feelings.

Now, here's where things get a bit complicated. My girlfriend, Sarah (23F), has been part of my life for about a year now. She’s great, but she doesn’t get along all that well with my friends. There’s some awkwardness because they’re all used to being just a group of guys, and she feels like an outsider sometimes.

A couple of weeks ago, I mentioned the trip to Sarah, and she immediately wanted to come along. I told her that it was a guys' trip, and it might be better if she didn't join us this time. I thought it would be a fun bonding experience for my friends and me, and I didn’t want any tension. Instead of understanding, Sarah got upset and accused me of not wanting her to be part of my life.

To make matters worse, I ended up telling my friends that Sarah wanted to come, but I told them I wasn’t sure if it was a good idea. They all agreed that it should just be the guys, and I felt relieved to have their support. So, I went back to Sarah and told her that my friends didn't want her to come.

She was really hurt and said I was being selfish for not including her. I told her I just wanted to have a fun week without any drama, and that she could go on a trip with her own friends instead. Now she’s giving me the silent treatment, and I feel bad because I still care about her.

I’ve also decided that I want a professional photographer and videographer to capture every moment, which adds to the cost.

I told my wedding party that I expect them to wear specific outfits that match my theme, and I even sent them links to purchase the exact dresses and suits I want. When a couple of my bridesmaids expressed concern about the cost of the outfits (which are around $300 each), I brushed it off, saying that they should consider it an investment for a memorable day.

To help cover my costs, I’ve decided to create a registry that includes things like the wedding cake, the catering, and even the photographer’s fee. I plan to ask each guest to contribute a minimum of $100 toward the registry items instead of buying traditional gifts.

Recently, she invited a few friends over to showcase her latest pieces, and I was excited to see them. However, when I arrived, I noticed that one painting didn’t look quite finished — the colors seemed off, and the composition felt a bit unbalanced. I thought it would be helpful to mention this to her, hoping she’d appreciate the feedback.

So, during the gathering, I said, “I think that piece might benefit from a little more color in the background or maybe some additional elements to balance it out.” She looked at me, her expression shifting from excitement to disappointment. She responded by saying, “I thought you would be supportive, but clearly, you’re just going to critique everything I do.”

Context:
I (30M) have been dating my girlfriend (28F) for about a year. We met through mutual friends and have been pretty happy together. We both have steady jobs, and while I earn a bit more than her, we usually split expenses fairly evenly. We live together and have always been open about finances, but we keep our personal spending separate.

Issue:
Recently, I decided I wanted to renovate my home office to create an ideal workspace. I've always dreamed of having a space that reflects my style and allows me to be more productive. Without discussing it with my girlfriend, I went ahead and hired a contractor to do a complete remodel. I spent a significant amount of money—around $15,000—on this project.

When I revealed the news to her, I was excited and thought she would be happy for me. Instead, she was upset. She expressed that I should have consulted her first since we live together and she uses that space too, even if it's primarily my office. She felt that making such a big financial decision without discussing it was inconsiderate and made her feel excluded from our shared living situation.

I responded by saying that it was my money and my space, so I didn’t see the need for her approval. I told her that I work hard and deserve to spend my money how I want. I felt justified in my decision, thinking she should understand my passion for creating a great workspace. 

Now, I'm starting to wonder if I overstepped and should have included her in the conversation about the renovation. But I still feel that it was my decision to make.

I was excited to have everyone over, but I wanted to do it my way and make it a little more casual compared to my sister's usual formal approach.

As we were planning, my sister suggested that we should stick to the traditional holiday menu that she always prepares, which includes a fancy roast and all the trimmings. I thought that was too much work and suggested we do a potluck instead, where everyone could bring a dish they like. I thought it would be fun and take the pressure off, but she absolutely hated the idea.

Instead of compromising or discussing it nicely, I got frustrated and told her that her way was old-fashioned and that nobody even liked the food she made anyway. I didn’t hold back and said she was being controlling and overly dramatic about the whole event. This hurt her feelings, and she ended up crying on the phone.

Despite her being upset, I stuck to my guns and refused to change the plan. I felt that as the host, I should have the final say, and I thought my idea was better.

So, I (28M) have a friend named Mike (29M) who recently came out as bisexual. I’ve known Mike for years, and I’ve always considered myself pretty open-minded. However, I have a tendency to joke around a lot, sometimes without thinking about how others might feel.

A few weeks ago, we were hanging out with a larger group of friends and Mike brought up his experiences with dating. I thought it would be funny to make a joke and said something like, “Well, now that you're bi, it’s like you can’t decide if you want to date boys or girls; it’s the best of both worlds, right?” I chuckled and added, “Guess you can’t complain about having too many options!”

To my surprise, Mike got really quiet and looked uncomfortable. A couple of our other friends told me to stop joking about it and that it wasn’t funny. I shrugged it off initially, but Mike later told me he felt like I was trivializing his identity. I thought he was overreacting. I mean, it's just a joke, and I didn't mean any harm by it!

Since then, there’s been some tension, and I haven’t really spoken to him much. I feel like he’s being too sensitive. I tried to apologize, but it didn’t seem to help much. My other friends also said I should be more considerate, but I think it's hard to balance joking around and being respectful.

Last weekend, Sarah was feeling particularly down and asked if I could come over to hang out. I brought some snacks and we decided to binge-watch a new series.

In a moment of nostalgia and a little too much wine, I jokingly suggested that we should have a sleepover like we used to. Sarah laughed and agreed, and we decided to sleep in the living room together, just like old times.

So, a bit of background: I'm getting married in a few weeks, and I've been planning this wedding for over a year. It's a small, intimate ceremony with just close family and friends. My cousin Lisa, who is a bit dramatic and often the center of attention, recently announced that she's pregnant and due just a few weeks after my wedding. While I’m happy for her, I was also nervous about how her pregnancy might overshadow my special day. 

At my bridal shower, Lisa showed up wearing a dress that made her pregnancy very obvious. The shower was lovely, and everyone had a great time, but I couldn't shake the feeling that all the attention was on her. She kept talking about her pregnancy, her cravings, and how she was so excited to be a mom. I tried to steer the conversation back to the wedding, but it felt like every time I did, she found a way to bring it back to her pregnancy. 

A few days later, I was venting to my best friend about how I was feeling. I mentioned that I was worried Lisa would do something similar at the wedding and take away from my moment. My friend advised me to talk to Lisa about it before the wedding, so I decided to reach out.

When I spoke to Lisa, I tried to be gentle about it, but she reacted poorly. I told her I loved her and was happy for her, but that I wanted to have my day without any interruptions or overshadowing. I asked her to please keep the focus on the wedding during the ceremony and reception. Instead of understanding, she burst into tears and accused me of being selfish and insensitive. She said I was trying to diminish her joy and that it was her time to shine too.

I felt bad for upsetting her, but I also felt justified because it’s my wedding. The family got involved, with some supporting me and others saying I was being unreasonable. My mom told me that I should have focused on my wedding and not on anyone else's life events. But I still can’t shake the feeling that Lisa’s focus on her pregnancy would overshadow my big day.

You're the Asshole,"My girlfriend and I have been together for about three years, and we've started talking about moving in together. Recently, she suggested that we should get a pet, specifically a dog. I've always loved dogs, but I've never owned one, and I'm not sure I'm ready for that responsibility.

I told her I wasn't comfortable with the idea right now because I feel like it might be too much on top of everything else we have going on—work, relationships, and our plans to move in together. She was really excited about the prospect of getting a dog and even had some breeds in mind. I just brushed her off and said, ""Maybe later,"" and that I didn't think it was a good idea.

Last week, she came home with a puppy anyway, saying she just couldn't wait any longer. I was shocked and told her she shouldn't have done that without discussing it with me first. I was really upset and told her I wasn't ready to take care of a dog and that it was unfair for her to make such a big decision without me.

Now she’s feeling guilty about it and I’m feeling resentful that she went ahead and did it. I mean, I love the puppy, but I feel like she really crossed a line by ignoring my feelings. I’ve considered giving the puppy back, but I also don’t want to hurt her feelings. I think she should have respected my wishes and waited until we were both ready.

I told them that I didn't want to watch the movie anymore because I thought it would be too boring. I suggested we play a board game instead, knowing they were really into the movie we had picked. They were obviously disappointed but went along with my suggestion.

Eventually, they got up and left the room, saying they didn’t want to play anymore. I shrugged it off and continued playing alone, thinking they were overreacting.

I’ve always dreamed of a big, extravagant wedding. I grew up watching fairy tale movies and envisioning my own special day, and I want it to be memorable. Mia, on the other hand, is much more laid-back and has hinted several times that she would prefer something simple or even an elopement. She’s mentioned her anxiety about being the center of attention and how she’d feel overwhelmed with a large gathering, but I brushed it off because I was so focused on my vision for the wedding.

During the planning, I took control of everything. I booked a venue without really consulting her and started making a guest list that included all my extended family and friends. When she expressed discomfort with some of my choices, I would tell her she was overreacting or that it would be fine once we got into the moment. I genuinely believed that once we got to the wedding day, she would start enjoying it, and I didn’t think her anxiety was a big deal.

I’ve also been dismissive about her wanting to have more intimate discussions about our relationship and how she feels about the wedding. I just want to focus on the logistics and make sure everything is perfect. I even told her that it’s just one day and that she should be excited, which was insensitive since I know she struggles with anxiety.

Last week, she finally broke down and told me that she feels like she’s losing herself in all of this and that I’m not considering her feelings at all. I felt bad for her, but I also reacted defensively, saying that this day is important to me and she should support me. After that, she seemed really hurt and withdrawn.

Now I'm starting to realize that I might be an asshole for pushing my vision for the wedding without considering her feelings.

You're the Asshole,"So, I recently went on a trip with my friends to a cabin in the woods for a weekend getaway. The plan was to relax, hike, and enjoy some time away from the city. We were all excited, and I offered to take care of the grocery shopping since I thought it would save us some time and help keep costs down.

I went to the store and bought a bunch of food, including a ton of snacks and some fancy ingredients for meals. I also bought some expensive steak because I thought it would be a nice treat for everyone. When I got back to the cabin, I unpacked everything and put it all away.

As the weekend went on, I noticed that some of my friends weren't eating the steak or some of the other food I bought. I asked them why and they said they didn’t want to eat the expensive stuff because they felt bad about me spending so much money on it. At that point, I got really annoyed. I told them that I bought it for everyone to enjoy, and they should just relax and eat what I provided.

Later that night, we decided to have a barbecue, and I was excited to grill the steak. When I brought it out, one of my friends said they were on a budget and couldn’t justify eating the steak when they felt like it was too expensive. I got really frustrated and snapped at them, saying they needed to get over themselves and just enjoy the food I had bought.

I ended up arguing with a couple of friends about it, and the mood got pretty tense. I felt like I was being generous, and they were being ungrateful. The next day, I realized that I had been too harsh and that they were just trying to stick to their budgets, but I still felt justified in my anger at the time.

She took the time to show me around, introduced me to others, and even offered to help with some of my tasks. However, I found her approach a bit overwhelming. I’m the type who prefers to figure things out on my own, so I started ignoring her when she would check in on me.

One day, she brought in some homemade cookies for the team, and while everyone else was enthusiastic about them, I made a point to say I didn’t want any and even joked that I didn’t trust her baking skills. It was meant to be light-hearted, but I could see her face drop, and it kind of ruined the moment for her. When she walked away, I overheard her telling another coworker that she felt hurt by my comment.

I brushed it off and continued to keep my distance from her. A couple of days later, I found out she had been feeling anxious about her work because of my reaction and started to withdraw from the team. I told myself it wasn’t my problem, and it was her fault for being too clingy in the first place.

They’re planning their wedding, and I’ve been supportive of them throughout the process. However, I’ve found myself increasingly frustrated with the decisions they’re making for the wedding, particularly related to the guest list.

Lily and Jake have a lot of friends from college, and they both want to keep the wedding small and intimate. I totally get that, but here’s the thing: they’re only inviting a handful of family members. My parents and I are invited, but they’ve decided not to invite any of our extended family, including our grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. Lily claims she wants to avoid drama and tension, but I think it’s unfair to exclude our family like this.

Last week, I confronted Lily about it. I told her that it wasn’t right to leave our family out, especially since this is a big milestone in her life. I suggested that she at least invite our grandparents since they might not have many more family events to attend. Lily got really upset with me and accused me of trying to control her wedding plans. She said it’s her day and that she should be able to decide who she wants there without feeling guilty.

In a moment of frustration, I told her that if she didn’t invite family, it would look really bad, and it would come off as if she’s embarrassed of us. I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings, but now she’s really upset and says I’ve ruined her excitement for the wedding. She’s even considering not inviting me at all, which I think is a bit extreme.

She's super excited about starting her new job and moving into her own place. My parents are really proud of her, and they've been throwing her a mini celebration at our house.

Now, I have a pretty successful career and I've been living independently for a while. I wanted to support my sister and I offered to buy her some essentials for her new apartment. However, I decided to make it a little more interesting by getting her a really expensive coffee maker and a fancy set of kitchen knives, things I thought would impress her and be useful.

The problem arose when my sister unwrapped the gifts during the family gathering. Her expression shifted from excitement to confusion, and then she looked really upset. She told me that she appreciated the gesture but felt overwhelmed. She explained that she was still figuring things out, and the pressure of having expensive items made her feel inadequate. She said she just wanted basic things to start with, like pots and pans or maybe some groceries.

I brushed it off, thinking she was overreacting, and made a joke about how she would thank me later when she made her first fancy meal.

Recently, our company organized a team-building retreat, and I was really looking forward to it. I thought it would be a great way for everyone to bond, including Sarah, who I assumed could use a break from her stress. A few days before the retreat, she texted me saying she was feeling overwhelmed and wouldn’t be able to go. I totally understood and told her it was okay to take care of herself.

However, when I got to the retreat, I was shocked to see Sarah there, having fun with another group of coworkers. I felt betrayed and hurt because I thought we were friends, and here she was, enjoying herself without me. I guess I felt like she was choosing to ignore our friendship for the sake of others.

We’ve been friends for a few years now, and she’s always been a little more reserved than I am.

At first, she was visibly uncomfortable, and I thought she’d just warm up as the questions started coming. But instead, she turned bright red and looked like she wanted to disappear. I didn’t stop, though; I thought I was helping her. I encouraged people to ask her about her interests, her job, and her favorite movies. Each time someone asked her something, she’d mumble a response and look down, clearly more anxious with each passing minute.

Eventually, she got so flustered that she excused herself to go to the bathroom and didn’t come back for a long time. I felt kind of bad, but I thought maybe I was just pushing her a little bit to help her grow.

I told her that I couldn’t help her financially because I’m trying to save up for my own future and that I didn't have any extra cash to spare.

You're the Asshole,"My son Jake (12) is really into basketball. He’s been playing for a couple of years now and has always been on the same local youth team, where he’s made some great friends. The team has a good mix of kids, and they generally get along well. However, there’s one player, Tim, who has been a problem. Tim is quite talented but has a nasty streak and often puts Jake down during practice, calling him names like ""slowpoke"" or ""not even a real player."" Jake comes home upset sometimes, but he insists he wants to stick with the team.

Last week, they had an important game against a rival team. Before the game, I overheard Tim making fun of Jake again, saying he was going to ""drag the team down"" and that they didn’t have a chance with him on the court. I was furious but didn’t want to escalate things too much. I figured they were just kids, but I did bring it up with the coach, hoping he could address it without making a huge scene. 

During the game, Jake managed to score a couple of points, but he was super nervous and kept looking over at Tim, who was glaring at him from the bench. After the game, which they ended up losing, Tim told Jake that he lost it for everyone and that no one wanted him on the team. Jake came home in tears, and I felt really bad for him. 

In my anger, I decided to confront Tim’s parents. I sent them a message about how their son’s behavior is unacceptable and how it's affecting Jake. I didn’t hold back, and I called Tim a bully. I thought they needed to know how their son was behaving, but I didn’t get the response I expected. They were defensive and said it’s just ""normal competition"" and that Jake needs to toughen up if he wants to play sports.

Now, I’m thinking about pulling Jake from the team altogether. I’m worried that he’ll only suffer more if I leave him there and that he’ll continue to feel like a failure. I know he loves basketball and has some friends on the team, but I’m convinced that he’ll be better off somewhere else where he’s not bullied.

Looking back, I realize I might have overreacted by messaging Tim’s parents and potentially escalating the situation. Maybe I should have just focused on supporting Jake and helping him build his confidence instead. I feel guilty for putting him in a tough spot, and I’m worried that my actions will make him feel worse.",770,2931,0.56,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_88719,2019-06-18 00:00:00,YTA,2330,AITA

This year, I was really excited because we decided to go to a beach resort for a week in July. I booked my flights and accommodations early, and I was counting down the days. However, a few months later, my sister announced that she was having her baby shower on the same weekend. I knew how important these events are to her, but I also felt that I had already committed to my friends and it would be hard to change my plans last minute.

When I told my sister that I wouldn’t be able to attend her shower because I had already made plans, she got really upset. She said that family should come first and I was being incredibly selfish for prioritizing my friends over her special day. I brushed it off, thinking that she would understand. After all, it was just a baby shower, and we would have more family gatherings in the future.

The day of the baby shower came, and I was having a great time with my friends at the beach. I did send my sister a text wishing her well and letting her know I was thinking of her, but I didn’t think it was enough to warrant attending. She later posted pictures of the baby shower on social media, and I could see how much effort she had put into it.

A few weeks later, she confronted me about not attending and told me how hurt she felt. I just shrugged it off and said that it wasn’t a big deal to miss a shower. I still think I made the right choice because I’ve been looking forward to this trip for months, but now I feel the tension between us.

A week after I started, my coworker, who is also new, asked if I could help him out with a project he was struggling with. He seemed genuinely lost and said he was feeling overwhelmed. I agreed to help him, thinking it would be a great way to bond and show that I’m a team player.

However, as we worked together, I realized he wasn’t putting in the same effort I was. I ended up doing most of the work while he sat back and let me handle everything. I started to feel frustrated and resentful, especially since I was already balancing my own tasks.

After we submitted the project, he thanked me but didn’t acknowledge how much I had actually done. I got it into my head that he was taking advantage of my willingness to help. Later, I overheard him talking to another coworker about how he was so relieved I had stepped in to save the project. This really rubbed me the wrong way.

Feeling upset, I decided to confront him. I told him that I was disappointed he didn’t do his fair share and made it clear that I wouldn’t be helping him again. I might have been a bit harsh, as he looked genuinely hurt and said he thought I was just being supportive.

So, my sister (28F) recently got engaged to her long-term boyfriend (30M), and they’re planning a wedding for next year. She’s really excited about it, and I’m happy for her. However, I’ve always had this dream of being the ""cool"" aunt, and I’ve been looking forward to having a niece or nephew to spoil one day.

The issue arose when my sister asked me to be her maid of honor. I was thrilled, but then she mentioned that she might want to have her fiancé’s sister also involved and potentially share the role. I thought this was a weird request, but I went along with it. After all, I want to support my sister.

Fast forward to a few weeks later, and my sister arranged a family dinner to discuss wedding plans. During the dinner, she brought up the idea of a joint bridal shower, and I couldn't help but blurt out, “Why would we want to share when I’m the one who's actually going to be the maid of honor?” I thought I was being funny, but the table fell silent, and my sister looked hurt.

After that, I tried to justify my comment by saying I just wanted to make it special for her and that I was excited to take the lead in organizing everything. However, my sister ended up getting really upset, saying I was trying to overshadow her and that she just wanted to include everyone. I told her that I didn't think it was fair to me to share the spotlight when I was the one who should be celebrated.

Now, she’s not talking to me and has hinted that she’s reconsidering my role in the wedding. I thought I was just being honest and trying to keep the focus on how special her day should be, but maybe I took it too far.

So, a couple of weeks ago, I had a birthday party planned for my best friend, Sarah. I had been planning it for a month and was super excited to throw her a surprise party. I invited a bunch of our friends, reserved a space at a nice restaurant, and was handling all the arrangements. The problem is, I didn’t really think about Sarah’s feelings and preferences.

Sarah isn’t a big fan of surprises or large gatherings; she prefers more intimate get-togethers. I know this because she’s mentioned it in the past, but for some reason, I thought she would love a big celebration this time. I thought it would be a great way to show her how much she means to me.

On the day of the party, I was really hyped and couldn’t wait to see her reaction. I made her come to the restaurant under the guise of grabbing dinner with me. When she walked in and saw all her friends there, she immediately looked overwhelmed. I could tell she wasn’t happy, but I kept encouraging her to enjoy it, insisting that everyone was there for her.

As the night went on, she tried to put on a brave face, but it was clear she was uncomfortable. I kept pushing her to mingle and take photos, even when she said she wanted to sit down and take a break. I thought I was doing the right thing by keeping the energy up, but she ended up feeling trapped and stressed out. 

At one point, she pulled me aside and told me she appreciated the effort but really just wanted a quiet dinner with me instead. I brushed her off, saying she was being dramatic and that she would be happy once she had a few drinks. I kept saying things like, “It’s your birthday! You have to enjoy it!” 

After a while, she just left the party and went home. I tried to call her, but she didn’t answer. The next day, she texted me, saying that my surprise had ruined her birthday and that I completely ignored her feelings. I was really taken aback because I thought I was being a good friend.

Now I feel terrible and I’m wondering if I was the asshole for planning the party and not listening to her when she said she didn’t want it. Was I the asshole?",603,2985,0.67,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_90291,2023-09-16 00:00:00,YTA,2246,AITA

One of my friends, Sarah (27), has a bit of a reputation for being a messy eater. She often spills things on herself, and I warned everyone to have some extra napkins or something handy when we eat.

During one of our meals, Sarah accidentally knocked over a bowl of pasta and sauce all over her shirt and the table. It was a pretty big mess, and while everyone was trying to help clean it up, I made a joke about how she should have known better and should just wear a bib next time. I thought it was funny, but she clearly didn’t appreciate it.

Instead of being supportive, I kept teasing her about it throughout the dinner. We were laughing, but I could see she was getting more and more upset. After dinner, she went outside to cool off. I followed her, but I continued to make light of the situation. I told her she should just embrace her “messy eater” title and that it was all in good fun.

When I arrived, I noticed that there was a cake that my friend had made himself, which he was really proud of. He had put in a lot of effort to bake it from scratch and decorated it nicely.

As the evening went on, everyone was enjoying the party and chatting. When it came time for dessert, my friend brought out the cake and started slicing it. I was really looking forward to having some since I had skipped dinner that night. 

When it was my turn to get a piece, I noticed there wasn’t a slice that was big enough for my taste. So, without thinking much, I reached over and grabbed the largest slice from the plate. My friend looked a bit shocked and said, “Uh, that was my favorite piece, I was saving that one for later.” I shrugged it off and said, “But it’s just cake! It’s all going to be eaten anyway.” 

He seemed a bit hurt, but I didn’t think much of it at the time. The others at the party started eating their slices, and I was enjoying mine, but I could see that my friend was still a bit upset. Eventually, he managed to laugh it off, but I could tell I had ruined some of the fun for him.

Later, I found out that he had planned to save a piece of that cake for himself the next day because it was his favorite flavor. I felt a bit bad, but I ended up convincing myself that it was just cake and that he shouldn’t have been so sensitive about it.

Last week, I had some family over for dinner, and Lily was supposed to join us. She texted me last minute saying she couldn’t make it because she had to do a long run and “couldn’t risk missing training.” I was a bit annoyed because it felt like she was prioritizing her training over family. So, during dinner, I mentioned to our relatives that Lily is becoming a bit of a fitness fanatic and that she might need to chill out a bit. I thought it was funny and that everyone would get a laugh out of it.

Unfortunately, it didn’t go over well. My parents were concerned, and my uncle even suggested that she might be developing an unhealthy obsession.

This has made our financial situation much more comfortable, and my wife has decided to quit her job as a waitress to focus on her art career full-time. I was supportive of her decision initially, encouraging her to pursue her passion.

However, things took a turn when she started to spend more time on social media, showcasing her artwork and connecting with other artists. She has been really excited about her new venture, but I started to notice that a lot of her online friends are quite radical in their views, especially when it comes to politics and social issues. They frequently post about activism, and some of their views seem really extreme to me.

A few weeks ago, she told me about an upcoming art exhibition that she wanted to participate in, which aims to promote social justice themes. I was skeptical about this because I felt that her art should be about her personal experiences and not be tied to such divisive topics. I expressed my concerns, suggesting that she focus on creating art that appeals to a broader audience instead of diving into contentious issues.

When she insisted that this exhibition would be a great opportunity for her and that she felt strongly about the cause, I became frustrated. I told her that I didn't want her to participate and that she should focus on making art for art's sake, not for any political agenda. I argued that her involvement in these kinds of events could damage her reputation and our social life, and I felt embarrassed that she might be associated with people who have such extreme views.

She was hurt and confused by my reaction, saying that she thought we were supportive of each other's passions. I told her that if she wanted to make art, she should stick to what I deemed ""safe"" topics and not get involved in anything that could be controversial.

Last week, however, the team lead decided to order from a new pizzeria that does not offer vegan options at all.

Since she was little, I’ve had a vision of what I want for her life: a great career, a solid college education, and a stable job. I often remind her that getting into a good university is crucial and that she needs to work hard to achieve her goals.

Lily has always been a decent student, mostly Bs and a few As. Recently, she expressed interest in pursuing art and becoming a graphic designer.

When I found out she had been sketching and working on digital art during her free time, I was furious. I told her that art isn’t a real career and that she needed to focus on her studies instead. I made it clear that if her grades slipped, I would take away her tablet and any art supplies. I know it sounds harsh, but I thought I was doing what’s best for her.

You're the Asshole,"So this just happened.

I’m a high school teacher, and I have a bit of a reputation for being tough on my students. I believe in high standards, and I don’t tolerate any excuses for poor performance. Recently, I assigned a big project that counted for a significant portion of their grade. I gave them a month to work on it.

One student, let’s call him Jake, approached me a week before the deadline and asked for an extension. He explained that he had been dealing with some personal issues at home and was struggling to focus on his schoolwork. I listened to him, but my answer was a firm no. I told him that life is tough, and he needed to learn to manage his time better. 

The day before the project was due, I noticed Jake had not submitted anything and seemed very stressed. Instead of offering help or a kind word, I called him out in front of the whole class, saying, “If you can’t handle a simple project, maybe you shouldn’t be in this class.” The students laughed, and I felt a sense of satisfaction for putting him in his place.

The next day, Jake came in looking defeated. He turned in an incomplete project and I gave him a lower grade than he deserved due to his lack of effort. I thought I was teaching him a lesson, but now I’m starting to feel guilty. Some of my colleagues told me I was too harsh, but I still stand by my approach.

You're the Asshole,"I have a friend, Jake, who is really passionate about fitness and eating healthy. He’s always posting about his workouts and meal prep on social media, which I think is great. However, I don’t really follow that lifestyle. I enjoy my fast food and snacks, and I don’t feel the need to change my eating habits just because he’s into health and fitness.

Recently, Jake invited me over for a movie night and offered to make dinner. I told him I’d bring dessert since I love baking. I decided to make brownies, but I used a box mix that had a note saying “may contain traces of nuts” because they were on sale. Jake has a severe nut allergy, and I knew I should have been more careful, but I figured it probably wouldn’t hurt him since I was mixing it with other ingredients.

When I got to his place, I mentioned that the brownies might have nuts, but I was excited to share them. He got really upset and told me it was irresponsible to bring something that could potentially harm him. I shrugged it off and said he was being overly dramatic because it’s just dessert and it’s not like I intentionally tried to hurt him. 

I ended up eating the brownies myself while he had to eat just the dinner he made. I felt like he was being rude for not appreciating my gesture. Am I wrong for thinking he should have just been more careful and not taken it so seriously?

AITA?

You're the Asshole,"So, I (25F) recently moved into a new apartment complex with my roommate (26F). It’s been a pretty chill experience overall, but we have a neighbor (60sM) who lives next door and has been a bit of a nuisance. He’s always banging on the wall if we play music or laugh a little too loudly, which is pretty annoying but we try to keep it in check.

One day, my roommate and I had a few friends over for a small gathering to celebrate my birthday. We were having a good time, playing some music, and just enjoying ourselves. I knew the noise might bother him, but I figured it was a special occasion and we could let loose a bit.

Around 10 PM, the banging started again. I ignored it at first, but then it escalated to him yelling through the wall for us to be quiet. Instead of taking the hint, I decided to respond back. I yelled, “If you can’t handle a little fun, maybe you should move to a retirement home!” My friends thought it was hilarious, but in retrospect, I probably should have just ignored him.

Things got out of hand when I walked over to his door with my friends and knocked. When he answered, I kind of just flipped my hair back and said, “We’re having a party, old man! Get used to it!” My friends were laughing, and I felt a rush from it, but honestly, it was pretty disrespectful.

After that, he told us he was going to call the landlord to report us for excessive noise and harassment. I brushed it off and told him to go ahead. It was my birthday, and I didn’t want anything to ruin my fun, even if it meant being a bit of a jerk.

The next day, I received a message from the landlord saying they had complaints about us being excessively loud and disruptive. I felt a little guilty but mostly thought, “Whatever, he needs to lighten up.”

I've voiced my concerns to him before, but he insists that she's perfect for him.

Last weekend, we had a family get-together, and during dinner, I made a joke about how he should be careful not to get ""trapped"" by her, referencing how she always seems to be the center of attention in their relationship and pulls him away from family events. I thought it would come off as lighthearted teasing, but he got really upset and told me to stop making jokes about his girlfriend.

After dinner, he pulled me aside and said I need to respect his choices and that I should treat his girlfriend with kindness. I laughed it off, thinking he was being overly sensitive. I told him that as an older sister, it was my job to look out for him. I thought I was just being honest and helping him see the truth about her.

Now, he's barely speaking to me, and I feel like he's overreacting. I reached out to him a couple of days later to apologize for the comment, but I didn't apologize for my opinion on her. He said that it wasn't just about the joke but how I constantly undermine his relationship.

She spends a lot of time experimenting with different scents and styles, and honestly, her candles have been getting pretty popular among our friend group. I think it’s great that she found a hobby she loves, but I’ve never really been a fan of the scents she chooses. They can be quite overpowering and sometimes smell a bit cheap.

Recently, Sarah decided to throw a small get-together and was excited to showcase her latest candle creations. She had made a few new scents, and I knew she was looking forward to getting everyone’s feedback. However, the moment I walked into her apartment, I was hit with a wave of a sickly sweet scent that made me feel a bit nauseous.

I didn’t want to hurt her feelings, but I also couldn’t stand the smell. While we were hanging out, I casually mentioned that I thought her latest candle was too sweet and reminded me of a cheap perfume. She seemed taken aback but laughed it off. But I could tell it bothered her.

Later in the evening, after everyone had left, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I went into her kitchen while she was distracted and poured a bunch of vinegar into the candle wax to dilute the scent. I figured she could just start over with the next batch, and I didn’t think it would hurt anything since she made her candles anyway.

When Sarah discovered what I had done the next day, she was furious. She felt I had completely disrespected her work and tampered with something she was passionate about. I tried to explain that I thought I was helping her by making her candles more palatable, but she didn’t see it that way.

As I was leaving, I overheard one of the waitstaff joking with a colleague about how they usually take the tips home and split them among themselves, which made me feel a bit uneasy. I also learned that they don’t always share tips with the kitchen staff who work hard behind the scenes.

The manager was taken aback and tried to explain that it was a common practice in many restaurants, but I wouldn’t hear it.

Later, I overheard some of the staff talking about how I was being rude and entitled for trying to dictate how they handle their tips. I still feel like I was in the right because I wanted to support everyone who contributes to the restaurant, but now I’m questioning if I went too far.

When my friends arrived, we all settled down to watch the first movie. About halfway through, one of my friends, Sarah, mentioned that she was feeling really hungry. She asked if I had any more snacks because she was still hungry after the popcorn. Honestly, I thought she was being a bit dramatic since we had already eaten a lot of snacks.

I didn't want to get up and miss any of the movie, so I just shrugged it off and said, “I think we have enough food.” I could tell she was disappointed, but I didn't think it was that big of a deal. Everyone else seemed fine, so I figured Sarah just needed to toughen up a little.

After the movie ended, I noticed that Sarah looked a bit upset. I asked if everything was okay, and she said she was just really hungry and felt like I didn’t care about her feelings. I didn’t understand why she was overreacting; I had provided snacks, and it wasn’t my fault she didn’t eat more earlier.

After the breakup, I spread rumors around school that she was cheating on me, even though there was no evidence. I did this because I wanted to justify my feelings and make myself look better in front of my friends. Looking back, I realize that it was petty and cruel, and I ended up hurting her reputation.

I was saying stuff like, ""Wow, Jake, you’re really laying it on thick, huh?"" and ""I didn’t know you were such a smooth talker!"" Everyone was laughing, including him at first.

But then, I noticed that he started to get a bit uncomfortable. He went quiet, and I could tell that my jokes were bothering him. Instead of stopping, I kept going, thinking it was still funny and that he would eventually laugh it off like he usually does. I even made a comment about how he should just ask her out already, which drew a few chuckles from others.

At some point, he just walked away from the conversation, clearly upset. I didn't think it was a big deal because we joke around all the time. A mutual friend later told me that Jake had really liked the girl and was nervous about impressing her, and my teasing made him feel embarrassed and anxious.

When I found out, I didn't think I did anything wrong. I mean, we joke around all the time, right? But now I'm starting to wonder if I crossed a line and hurt my friend.

You're the Asshole,"I have a younger sister, Lily, who’s 17 and loves photography. For her birthday last year, I decided to gift her a really nice camera that I had saved up for. It’s a fantastic piece of equipment, and I thought it would really help her with her passion.

Fast forward a few months, and I notice that she’s been taking a lot of pictures and posting them on social media. I’ve always been supportive, but I also took the time to mention that I would love to see her work in a gallery one day. I even offered to help her set up an online portfolio.

Recently, I found out that Lily was planning to enter a local photography competition. I was excited for her and offered to help with some editing and guidance. However, when she showed me her final selections, I was a bit critical. I felt that some of her best work wasn’t included, and I suggested that she swap a few out. 

Instead of being constructive, I ended up pushing her too hard, insisting that the pieces she chose were not good enough. I even told her that she couldn’t possibly win with those photos and that she really needed to step her game up. 

Lily ended up feeling really discouraged and withdrew her submission from the contest. She said she felt like a failure and that my feedback crushed her enthusiasm. I thought I was just being honest and trying to help her, but now I see that I might have crossed a line.

You're the Asshole,"So, my buddy is getting married next month, and I (28, M) have been asked to be his best man. I was really excited about it, but then I got this idea in my head that I wanted to throw an epic bachelor party. I’ve been planning it for weeks, and I might have gone a little overboard.

I rented a really expensive cabin in the mountains for the weekend, booked activities like white-water rafting and zip-lining, and even hired a private chef to cook for us. The problem? I didn’t consult my buddy at all about the plans or the budget. I just assumed he would love everything I organized.

When I finally told him about it, he seemed a bit overwhelmed. He expressed that he wanted something more low-key, maybe just a weekend BBQ and some games with close friends. But I brushed him off, saying he would have more fun at my planned event and that he would thank me later.

Now, he’s really upset because he feels like I’m not respecting what he wants for his own bachelor party. He also mentioned that he doesn’t want any of his other friends to feel pressured to spend a lot of money on the trip, since I didn’t take that into account when planning. 

I get that I may have gone a bit overboard, but I thought I was doing something great for him. I know I might have disrespected his wishes, but I just wanted everything to be perfect.

You're the Asshole,"I recently attended a friend's wedding, which was a big event with lots of guests. The couple had a beautiful ceremony, and afterwards, there was a reception with dinner and dancing. Everything seemed perfect until it came time for the speeches.

The best man was set to give his speech, and I thought it would be funny to interrupt him with a joke during his speech about how much money he owed the groom for being such a great friend. It was a little spontaneous, and I thought it would lighten the mood. As soon as I made the joke, the atmosphere shifted. The best man looked visibly annoyed, and some guests laughed awkwardly while others just stared at me.

After the speech, I could see that the best man was upset, and a few attendees even pulled me aside to say that I had ruined a special moment for the couple. I brushed it off, thinking they were overreacting. It's just a wedding, right? People should be able to take a joke.

Later on, I caught up with the groom, and he mentioned that he was disappointed in how I handled it, saying that the speeches were supposed to be heartfelt and meaningful. I honestly didn't think it was that big of a deal. I still feel like I was just trying to lighten the mood, and everyone else was too sensitive.

You're the Asshole,"So my friend Sarah invited me to her wedding, which was set to take place in a beautiful venue. I was really excited to celebrate with her, but I had some reservations about attending. You see, I don’t really get along with Sarah’s fiancé, Mike. He and I have had a few disagreements in the past, and I just don’t like the way he treats her. Despite this, I wanted to be supportive and decided to go to the wedding.

A couple of weeks before the big day, I received an invitation with a note that said children were not allowed at the wedding. I thought this was a bit strange since Sarah and Mike had a lot of friends with kids, but I respected their decision. However, I had already made arrangements to take care of my niece, who I watch quite often. I figured it would be fine to bring her along since I didn't think anyone would care—after all, she’s just a little kid and wouldn’t be a distraction.

On the day of the wedding, I showed up with my niece in tow. Sarah saw us and immediately looked upset. She pulled me aside and said that I couldn't have my niece there, and I told her it was too late to find a sitter and that my niece would be fine. I even made a joke about how kids are cute and everyone loves them, but Sarah was clearly irritated. 

During the ceremony, my niece was a little restless and ended up making some noise, which drew attention. I could see Sarah glaring at me from the front row. Afterward, she confronted me and said that I had ruined a significant part of her day by not respecting her wishes. I felt bad but also thought she was overreacting.

I hadn't seen him in months, and honestly, I didn't feel comfortable being around him, especially at a celebration.

I explained to her that it was really hard for me to be around him and that I just wanted to enjoy her birthday without any awkwardness. She replied that she appreciated my feelings but felt it was unfair to ask her to uninvite someone, especially since he was friends with other guests and had already confirmed his attendance.

I got a bit upset and told her that if she didn’t want to make my comfort a priority, then I wouldn’t feel comfortable attending her party. I ended up not going and instead posted on social media about how I was disappointed she didn’t support me, hoping to get sympathy from others.

Looking back, I realize I might have overstepped by asking her to uninvite someone just for my comfort, but at the moment, I felt justified in wanting to avoid an awkward situation. AITA?",922,1249,0.85,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_20618,2019-02-23 00:00:00,YTA,1295,AITA

I wanted to make a great impression, so I went all out with the food and decorations. I also thought it would be fun to have a theme for the evening and settled on a “fancy dress” theme, encouraging everyone to wear their best attire. I made it clear in the group chat that it was a formal affair.

On the day of the party, I noticed one of my friends, Sarah, who has always been a bit more casual in her fashion choices, showed up in a simple sundress and sandals. I was disappointed as I expected everyone to adhere to the dress code. When I saw her outfit, I couldn’t help but make a comment. I said something like, “Wow, did you even read the invitation? This is a fancy dress party, not a beach day!” I laughed, but it was a little snarky.

Sarah’s face fell, and she replied that she thought the sundress was nice but didn’t realize it had to be more formal. I shrugged it off, thinking she was being overly sensitive. 

Throughout the evening, I noticed she seemed quieter than usual, and at one point she excused herself to go home early. Later, I received a text from her saying she felt embarrassed and hurt by my comment, and that it put a damper on her night. I replied that I was just joking and didn’t think it was a big deal.

You're the Asshole,"I (24F) have a younger sister, ""Emily"" (20F), who has been dating this guy ""Jake"" for about a year. I never really liked him because he has a tendency to be rude and dismissive, especially toward Emily. My sister deserves someone who treats her well, and I've made it clear to her that I don't think Jake is that person. Emily, however, is head over heels for him and insists that he’s just misunderstood.

Last weekend, we had a family gathering, and Jake was invited. I decided to take it upon myself to make my feelings about him known. I thought it would be funny to roast him a little during dinner, so I started telling stories about things he had done that I found inappropriate or rude. For example, I shared the time he made a snide comment about Emily's cooking skills in front of our parents, framing it as a ""funny"" story.

Everyone was laughing, but I noticed Emily's face go pale. After a few more jabs, she finally snapped and told me to stop. I brushed it off, thinking she was just being overly sensitive. I kept digging, saying things like, ""Are you sure you want to be with someone who thinks it's okay to insult you in front of your family?""

After dinner, Emily dragged me aside and told me that I had embarrassed her and ruined the evening. I told her that I was just looking out for her and that it was my duty as her older sister to steer her away from guys like Jake. She was furious and said that I made her feel small and that I should have respected her choices.

You're the Asshole,"I apologize in advance, I’m on mobile.

So, this happened a few months ago. I was out with my friends at a local club to celebrate a birthday. There was a good vibe, and we were all having a great time. At some point, I noticed a guy across the bar who seemed to be eyeing me. After a couple of drinks, I decided to approach him and we started chatting.

During our conversation, he mentioned that he was in a long-distance relationship, but he didn't seem too invested in it. He made comments about how hard it was to keep things going when they were so far apart, and I could tell he was frustrated. I thought, ""Hey, he’s an adult and can make his own decisions,"" so I didn’t think much of it.

After a few more drinks, we ended up dancing and things got pretty heated. One thing led to another, and we ended up back at his place. I was aware he had a girlfriend, but I assumed it was more of a casual thing since he was openly discussing his relationship issues. We ended up sleeping together.

The next morning, I felt a bit guilty but rationalized it by thinking that he must have been unhappy in his relationship if he was willing to cheat. I figured it was a one-time thing and I wouldn’t hear from him again. However, he started texting me, and we ended up hooking up a couple more times over the next few weeks. 

Eventually, he confessed to me that he was actually quite serious about his girlfriend and that she was completely unaware of our encounters. I felt terrible when I heard this, especially since he had been so flippant about their relationship in the beginning. 

Now, I’m feeling really conflicted. I’ve started to develop feelings for him, and I know that’s wrong given the circumstances. I’m tempted to reach out to his girlfriend and tell her what’s been going on because I think she deserves to know the truth.

You're the Asshole,"So, I recently attended a wedding for a close friend, and I was really looking forward to celebrating with everyone. However, I made a bit of a mistake when it came to the reception. The venue had an open bar, and as the night went on, I started drinking more than I should have. 

At one point, I saw one of the servers carrying around a tray of fancy hors d'oeuvres. I was a bit tipsy and thought it would be fun to grab a few for myself and some friends. I called out to the server and asked for a couple of the appetizers. She obliged and handed me a few, but I ended up taking way more than I should have. 

As the night went on, I realized I was getting a bit too rowdy. I started joking around with some of the guests and made a few inappropriate comments about the bride's dress, which I thought were funny but clearly crossed a line. I could see some guests looking uncomfortable, and I should have picked up on that. 

Later on, I went back to the bar and asked for another drink. The bartender, who was also busy with other guests, politely told me that he couldn’t serve me any more alcohol because I seemed to be overdoing it. Instead of taking the hint, I got frustrated and argued with him, insisting that I was fine and that it was a wedding, after all. 

In the end, I didn’t get my drink, but I decided to grab a few more appetizers from the servers instead, not thinking about how that might come across. I overheard some guests talking about my behavior, and I realized I had embarrassed myself and made others uncomfortable.

You're the Asshole,"I (30M) recently had a big argument with my girlfriend (28F) about our living space. We moved in together about six months ago, and everything has been mostly great, but there’s one thing that’s been bothering me. 

I have a collection of action figures and comic books that I’ve been gathering since I was a kid. They mean a lot to me, and I display them proudly in our living room. My girlfriend, on the other hand, has a very different style. She prefers a minimalist aesthetic, with clean lines and neutral colors. She feels that my collection clutters the space and doesn’t match her vision for our home.

I understand where she’s coming from, but I can’t help but feel like she’s trying to erase a part of who I am. I told her that I wouldn't be able to compromise on the display of my collection, as it’s a significant part of my identity. Instead, I suggested that she could incorporate some of her minimalist decor alongside my collection, but she was not interested in mixing our styles. 

In a moment of frustration, I told her that if she really loved me, she would accept my collection for what it is. I accused her of being superficial and not appreciating the things that bring me joy. This led to a heated argument, and I could tell she was really hurt by my comments. I know she’s passionate about her home decor, but I feel like I’m being pushed into a corner about something that matters deeply to me.

Looking back, I realize I could have approached the situation differently. I could have been more open to finding a middle ground or at least acknowledged her feelings more.

You're the Asshole,"I (28F) recently got engaged to my boyfriend (30M) after dating for three years. A few months ago, I started planning our wedding and decided I wanted to have a small, intimate ceremony with just family and a few close friends. My fiancé was on board with this idea, but I also wanted to have a big reception later on to celebrate with everyone else. 

Here’s where things got tricky: I told my fiancé I wanted my best friend, who is also a professional photographer, to shoot both the wedding and the reception. My fiancé didn’t really know her well and suggested we hire a professional photographer instead. I got really upset and told him that I didn’t want a stranger capturing our special day. I insisted that my friend knows me and my style, and it wouldn’t feel right without her. 

I refused to compromise, saying it was my day and I should have who I want there. My fiancé tried to explain that it wasn’t about the photographer but about making sure we had the best experience and coverage. I ended up throwing a bit of a tantrum and said that if he didn’t agree to my friend as the photographer, I would consider it a lack of support for my choices and would reconsider the whole wedding. 

My fiancé was hurt and said I was being unreasonable. My family thinks I’m being stubborn, and I should at least be open to hiring a professional for the big day.

You're the Asshole,"So, I [28M] have a younger brother, Jake [22M], who has been dating his girlfriend, Emily [21F], for about a year now. They seem really happy together, and I genuinely like Emily. She’s sweet, fun, and a great fit for our family. Recently, Jake asked me to help him plan a surprise birthday party for Emily, which I was more than happy to do.

I took charge of the planning because I've organized a few parties in the past and figured I could help make it special. I coordinated with their friends, rented a place, and even got a cake with Emily's favorite flavor. However, as the planning progressed, I started getting a bit too involved. I wanted everything to be perfect, so I began making decisions without really consulting Jake or Emily’s friends.

A week before the party, I decided to invite some of Emily’s family members, including her parents, without discussing it with Jake first. I thought it would be a nice surprise for her, but I didn’t consider how she might feel about having her family there unexpectedly. When Jake found out, he was really upset. He felt like I was taking over and not respecting his vision for the party. He also pointed out that Emily might feel overwhelmed with her family showing up when she wasn’t expecting them.

On the day of the party, I realized that I had made a few other decisions that didn’t align with what Jake wanted, like the music playlist and some of the decorations. When Jake confronted me about it at the party, I brushed it off and insisted that I was just trying to make it memorable. Emily ended up feeling stressed with all the people and things going on, and I could see that she wasn't enjoying herself as much as I had hoped.

After the party, Jake told me that I ruined the surprise and that he felt like I undermined him. Emily thanked me for the effort but expressed that it was too much for her. I felt hurt because I thought I was doing something nice, but now I see that I overstepped and didn’t consider their feelings.

You're the Asshole,"I recently got a new job at a small marketing firm and was excited to start contributing to the team. During our first week, we were assigned to create a group presentation for a potential client. I was paired with a coworker, Sarah, who seemed really enthusiastic about the project.

As the days went by, I noticed that Sarah was putting in a lot of effort, doing research and drafting slides. I, on the other hand, got overwhelmed with other tasks and didn't contribute much to the presentation. I thought it would be fine since Sarah was handling it well and I could just fill in my part later.

The day before our presentation, I finally decided to take a look at what she had been working on. To my surprise, I found out that she had created an entire presentation without my input and had included some of my ideas that I had discussed with her earlier. Instead of acknowledging her hard work, I felt upset that she hadn’t consulted me more and claimed credit for my ideas.

The next morning, I confronted her before the presentation. I told her I thought it was unfair for her to take the lead without involving me more and that it made me look bad in front of our boss. I also suggested that she should have included my name more prominently in the slides to give me credit for the ideas. I could tell she was hurt, but I was adamant that she should have communicated with me better.

After the presentation, my boss praised Sarah's work and asked us to collaborate more in the future. I couldn’t help but feel resentful. I ended up telling Sarah that she really needed to step back and include me next time if she wanted to succeed as a team. She was clearly disappointed and said she felt undermined, but I thought I was just being honest.

She graduated with a degree in Fine Arts and has been trying to make a name for herself as an artist. The problem is, she’s struggling to get her work noticed and has been feeling disheartened lately. 

Recently, our parents threw a big family gathering to celebrate her birthday, and I decided to make a speech to encourage her. I thought it would be a good idea to highlight her artwork and encourage everyone to support her. In my speech, I mentioned how she had been struggling to sell her pieces and suggested that everyone take a look at her work and consider purchasing something. I thought it would motivate her and show her that her family believes in her.

After the speech, Sarah was visibly upset. She pulled me aside and told me that I had embarrassed her in front of everyone and made her feel like a failure by bringing up her struggles publicly. I didn’t understand why she felt that way; I thought I was being supportive. I told her that I was just trying to help her get more exposure and that sometimes we need a little push to succeed.

You're the Asshole,"I can't believe I'm in this situation, but here we go.

I have a younger sister, Mia, who's in high school. She's really into her studies and recently started participating in a lot of extracurricular activities, which I genuinely admire. However, she often comes home late because she stays after school for things like theater practice and debate club.

I've been living with my parents, and they’ve been super supportive of her, which is great. However, I've started to feel a bit left out and frustrated because I feel like I’m constantly being compared to her. My parents often say things like, ""Why can’t you be more like Mia?"" or ""Mia is so dedicated; you should take notes from her."" It gets under my skin because I've been trying to focus on my own career and work, and I don't need the pressure of being compared to a teenager.

So, last week, she asked me for a ride home after a late rehearsal. I was really tired from work and just wanted to relax, but I agreed since it was my responsibility as her older sibling. On the way back, I was annoyed and started making snide comments about how she needs to prioritize her time better or how she should quit some of these activities if they are making her lose sleep. I kept saying things like, ""You’re going to burn out,"" and ""Do you even have time for friends?"" 

Mia started to look upset, and I could tell I was being harsh, but I felt justified because I was only trying to help her. When we got home, she told my parents how I was being rude and belittling her efforts, and they blew up at me. They said I should be supporting her instead of tearing her down. 

Looking back, I realize I was acting purely out of jealousy and frustration, and I hurt her feelings when she was just trying to do her best. I know I could have approached the situation in a more supportive way instead of being bitter.

You're the Asshole,"So, I need to share this story that happened a couple of months ago, and now I’m questioning whether I messed up or not. I (28f) have a best friend, Mia (28f), who just had her first baby, a beautiful girl named Lily. Mia and I have been inseparable since childhood, and I was beyond excited when she became a mom.

A few weeks after Lily was born, Mia asked if I could help her out by babysitting for a few hours while she ran some errands. I gladly agreed, feeling honored that she trusted me with her newborn. However, when the day came, I started to feel anxious. I had never taken care of a baby before, and I was afraid I wouldn’t know what to do.

When Mia dropped Lily off, I quickly became overwhelmed. The baby was crying, and I couldn’t figure out why. I tried changing her diaper, feeding her, and even rocking her to sleep, but nothing worked. I panicked and ended up calling Mia multiple times, asking her to come back home sooner than planned. 

Mia was understandably frustrated with me, as she was trying to enjoy her first outing without her baby. I couldn’t handle the pressure and felt like I was failing as a friend. Eventually, Mia came back after about an hour, and I had to admit that I couldn't handle it. She took over and calmed Lily down almost immediately.

Afterwards, Mia told me she was really disappointed and that she had expected me to handle things better. I felt awful and ended up apologizing, but I could tell our friendship had shifted a bit. Since then, things have felt a bit awkward between us, and I’ve been second-guessing my actions.

I told her that if she really cared about me, she would have picked a different weekend. I even went as far as saying that if she didn’t change it, I wouldn’t be attending her party at all.

We usually host it at my house, and everyone was excited to come over. This year, I decided to make a special dessert that I had been planning for weeks—a pumpkin cheesecake, because it’s my sister's favorite.

The day before Thanksgiving, my sister called me and mentioned she was bringing her boyfriend along, who I had never met. I was okay with that, but I asked her if she could let him know that the cheesecake was a special surprise for her. I thought it would be nice for her to share something personal with him.

Thanksgiving comes, and I set everything up beautifully. The dinner goes well, and when it’s time for dessert, I proudly bring out the pumpkin cheesecake. My sister’s boyfriend immediately cuts himself a big slice without even asking anyone. My sister didn’t say anything either, and I was a bit taken aback, but I tried to brush it off.

I was hurt, and I admitted that I was disappointed because I made it for her. Instead of understanding, my sister snapped at me, saying I was being petty and that I shouldn't expect everyone to love the same things I do.

I got defensive and told her that if she didn't want to share something special, she shouldn't have brought her boyfriend. I also said that maybe it was better if they didn’t come next year if this was how it was going to be. Now my sister is mad at me and says I'm being an asshole for overreacting about a dessert.

Recently, my girlfriend has been expressing a desire to get a pet, specifically a dog. I grew up with dogs and while I like them, I’ve always felt that taking care of a dog is a huge responsibility that I’m not ready for right now.

At first, I tried to be supportive. I listened to her talk about different breeds and how awesome it would be to have a furry friend to come home to. But the more she talked about it, the more I realized I just didn’t want a dog. I like our current lifestyle, which is mostly low-maintenance and spontaneous. I don’t want to be tied down by the responsibilities of dog ownership, like walking, grooming, and training.

After a few weeks of her bringing it up, I became frustrated. Instead of having a mature conversation about it, I started making sarcastic comments whenever she mentioned adopting a dog. I would say things like, “Oh sure, let’s just add another creature to the family that will ruin our carpet!” or “Do you really want your life to revolve around taking care of a pet? Sounds fun.” Looking back, I can see that these comments hurt her feelings, but I thought I was just being funny and making my point clear.

Eventually, she asked me if we could at least go to the local animal shelter to look at some dogs. I reluctantly agreed, thinking maybe seeing some cute pups would soften my stance. When we got there, my girlfriend was clearly excited, but I was overwhelmed by the barking and the thought of having to care for a dog.

As we were walking around, I found myself saying negative things about each dog we saw, like “This one looks too hyper,” or “That one seems like it would chew up our shoes.” I could see my girlfriend’s enthusiasm fading. Finally, when we were about to leave, she looked really upset and said, “If you don’t want a dog, just say so. I can’t keep pretending this is something we both want.”

I was taken aback and just blurted out, “I don’t want a dog, and honestly, I don’t get why you do. It’s a huge commitment that I’m not ready for!” After that, she was really hurt and we ended up having a big argument about it on the way home. I realized I had been pretty dismissive of her feelings.

You're the Asshole,"I (24F) recently got engaged to my boyfriend (25M) after dating for three years. We both come from different backgrounds; my family is very supportive and open about celebrating special occasions, while his family is more reserved and doesn’t have big celebrations for things like engagements or weddings.

When we got engaged, I was excited to share the news, so I posted about it on social media with a beautiful photo of us and a heartfelt caption. I tagged him, of course, and expected everyone to be happy for us. However, when I looked at the comments, I noticed his family was largely silent, and I felt a bit hurt since they didn’t engage with my post.

A few days later, I decided to have a casual get-together with both our families to celebrate the engagement. I thought it would be a fun way for everyone to bond. However, during the gathering, his parents were surprisingly cold and didn’t really acknowledge the engagement at all. I felt like they were ruining the moment, and that upset me.

In a moment of frustration, I confronted them about why they weren’t celebrating with us. I told them that their lack of enthusiasm was really disappointing and made me feel unwelcome. I may have come off as rude, but I felt it was important for them to understand how their behavior affected me.

Afterwards, my fiancé expressed that I shouldn’t have confronted his parents in front of everyone and that I was being too harsh. He said it was their way of doing things and that I needed to respect that. I didn’t see it that way—I thought they needed to step up and be more supportive.

Now I’m left wondering if I overstepped and made things awkward for everyone. AITA for calling out his parents for not celebrating our engagement?",983,2446,0.73,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_55518,2021-01-02 00:00:00,YTA,1740,AITA
You're the Asshole,"So, I (28M) have a younger sister (22F) who recently got engaged to her boyfriend (25M) after dating for about a year. I always thought they were a bit rushed, but I kept my opinions to myself. Their engagement party was last weekend, and my parents went all out to celebrate them. 

At the party, my sister was glowing and really excited, but I noticed her fiancé seemed a bit off. I later found out that he had lost his job a few weeks prior and hadn’t told my sister yet. I thought it was strange that he would keep something like that from her, especially during such a big moment in their lives. 

During the party, we were having a toast and my sister was thanking everyone for their support. When it was my turn, I couldn’t help but bring up the fiancé’s job loss. I thought it was only fair that everyone knew what was going on and that my sister should be aware of it before they start planning their future together. 

The atmosphere shifted immediately. My sister looked devastated, and her fiancé was furious. After the toast, my sister pulled me aside and yelled at me for ruining her special moment. She accused me of being unsupportive and not understanding her relationship. I told her that it’s important to be honest in a relationship and that she deserved to know what she was getting into. 

Now, my parents are upset with me for causing such a scene, and my sister hasn’t talked to me since. I feel like I was just trying to protect her and make sure she had all the information she needed.

You're the Asshole,"I have a pretty close-knit group of friends, and we often hang out together on weekends. Recently, one of my friends, Lisa, started dating someone new, and she’s been spending a lot of time with him. I wasn't too thrilled about it because I feel like she’s been neglecting our friendship, and honestly, I didn't think he was a good match for her.

Last week, we were all supposed to go out for dinner, and I noticed that she didn’t bring her boyfriend, which I was secretly pleased about. During our dinner, I made a few comments about how nice it was to have her back with us and how I missed our old dynamic. I jokingly suggested that she should break up with him because he wasn’t good enough for her. Everyone laughed, but I could see Lisa’s expression change. She looked hurt, and I think I crossed a line.

After that dinner, she confronted me, saying that I was being rude and that I should support her choices. I shrugged it off and told her it was just a joke, and that she shouldn’t take it so seriously. Looking back, I realize I was dismissive of her feelings. To be honest, I was just jealous that she was spending time with someone else and not with us, and I didn’t handle it well.

Now, Lisa hasn’t been talking to me much, and our other friends are starting to take sides. I’m starting to feel like I might have been the asshole for not respecting her relationship and for being so insensitive. I know I should have kept my opinions to myself, but I just wanted to express my concerns. I feel bad about it, but I’m also frustrated that she can’t see I was just trying to look out for her.

A few weeks ago, Sarah mentioned that she was feeling insecure about her weight and how she wanted to lose some. I tried to be supportive and said she could join me for some workouts after work.

Fast forward to today. We were in the break room, and I overheard some colleagues making comments about Sarah's weight. I thought it would be funny to chime in and joke around, so I said something like, “Well, maybe if she joined me for those workouts, she wouldn’t have to worry about it!” Everyone laughed, but Sarah just sat there looking really uncomfortable. I thought she could take a joke, but she ended up leaving the break room without saying anything.

Later, I tried to talk to her and apologize, but she was clearly upset and told me that it wasn’t cool to make jokes about her weight, especially when she’s been struggling with it. I didn’t think my comment was that bad, and honestly, I thought I was helping her lighten the mood.

I’m not talking about a little clutter; I mean there are dishes piled up in the sink, crumbs all over the counters, and clothes strewn everywhere. I’ve mentioned it a couple of times, and she always brushes it off, saying she’s just busy with work and will clean up later.

I get that everyone has their own cleaning style, but it's hard for me to relax in that kind of environment. I’ve tried to help her out by cleaning up when I’m over there, but it’s like she doesn’t appreciate it. One day, after she ignored my suggestion to tidy up again, I took matters into my own hands. I spent hours cleaning her entire apartment while she was at work. I thought it would be a nice surprise and show her that I care.

When she came home and saw what I had done, she was furious. She told me that I had overstepped and that I shouldn’t have touched her things without asking.

You're the Asshole,"So, I recently got into a situation with my neighbor that I really regret. We live in a duplex, and I share a wall with this single mom and her young daughter. We've always had a decent relationship, but honestly, I never really interacted with them much.

One day, I was having a small gathering at my place—nothing wild, just a few friends over for some drinks and games. As the night went on, we got a bit loud, laughing and playing music. I didn’t think much of it since it was a Friday night, and I figured it wouldn’t be a big deal.

At some point, we were playing a party game that involved shouting and laughter, and I guess it got a little out of hand. I noticed my neighbor had her lights on, and I thought, ""It’s a Friday; she’ll be fine."" But then, I saw her daughter peeking out of the window, looking kind of upset.

Instead of calming down or taking it inside, I decided to keep the energy up and even started jokingly shouting to my friends about how we were ""making the neighborhood fun."" I didn’t really think about how my neighbor felt or how the noise might be affecting her daughter.

The next day, she came over and knocked on my door, clearly annoyed. She told me that her daughter had a hard time going to sleep because of our noise and that she had to comfort her several times. I felt embarrassed but tried to laugh it off, saying it was all in good fun. I even joked that we’d invite them next time to join in. 

Looking back, I realize I was dismissive of her feelings and made light of a situation that was clearly frustrating for her. I didn’t mean to be a jerk, but I can’t help but feel like I should have been more considerate. Now, I feel pretty guilty about it.

We all went out for dinner together, and I couldn’t help but notice that he seemed really self-absorbed. He spent a lot of time talking about himself, posting selfies at the table, and even interrupted Sarah while she was trying to share something about her day. I could tell she was a bit embarrassed, but she kept trying to engage him in conversation.

After dinner, we went back to my place for drinks, and Mike continued to dominate the conversation. At one point, I jokingly said, “Wow, Mike, I didn’t know we were all here to listen to your life story. Maybe we should get you a microphone.” I thought it was funny, but Sarah looked mortified, and Mike just smirked, clearly unfazed.

Later, when Mike went to the bathroom, I turned to Sarah and said, “I don’t think he’s a good match for you. He’s so full of himself, and I can see why you’ve had bad luck in the past. You deserve someone who treats you better.” She got really upset and told me that I was being rude and judgmental. I tried to defend myself, saying I was just looking out for her.

After the night ended, she texted me saying she felt hurt by my comments and that I shouldn’t have said anything negative about someone she was trying to get to know.

You're the Asshole,"I’ve always been really strict about how my son, who is 10, should behave at home and in public. I believe in teaching him discipline and manners, so I often set high expectations for his behavior. 

Recently, I took him to a birthday party for one of his classmates. As we arrived, I noticed other kids were running around, laughing, and having a great time. I felt a bit uncomfortable because I thought they were being too loud and chaotic. I told my son he needed to sit quietly and not engage with the other kids unless it was in a structured activity. He looked sad but complied.

Throughout the party, I would regularly remind him to keep his voice down and avoid playing with the other kids. At one point, he approached me and asked if he could join a game of tag. I told him “no” and that he needed to be respectful and calm. I could see he was upset, but I still thought I was doing the right thing by enforcing my rules.

By the end of the party, he looked miserable, and I overheard him telling one of his friends that he didn’t have fun because he wasn’t allowed to play. I felt a bit guilty, but I brushed it off and thought that I was teaching him important lessons about discipline and self-control.

When we got home, he didn't want to talk much and went straight to his room. I realize now that I might have ruined his experience by being too controlling, but I still think it was important to teach him how to behave properly in social settings.

I put a lot of effort into planning the evening—cooking a nice dinner, decorating, and even preparing a playlist of our favorite songs. 

One of my friends, Sarah, showed up late. When she walked in, she was wearing an oversized t-shirt and sweatpants while everyone else had dressed up a bit for the occasion. I didn’t think much of it at first, but as the night went on, I couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed. I had put in so much effort, and it felt like she didn't care to make an effort for my birthday.

At one point, I pulled her aside and said, ""It’s my birthday, and I was hoping you’d dress up a little for the occasion. It feels like you didn’t even try."" She was really taken aback and told me I was being rude and ungrateful. She said she thought the night was about having fun with friends, not about what we wore.

Recently, he finally decided to go for it and wanted to invest in a food truck. I thought it was a great idea and wanted to support him. I suggested that I could help him by lending him some of my savings, with the understanding that he would pay me back once the business got off the ground. I thought this would strengthen our relationship and show him that I believe in his dream.

I told him I’d be happy to take a risk because I love him and want to see him succeed.

Recently, I decided to surprise her for our anniversary by booking a weekend getaway to a nice resort about three hours away. I thought it would be a great way to celebrate and spend quality time together. The problem is that I used our joint savings account to pay for it without discussing it with her first.

I (25/m) have a close friend, Jake (26/m), who recently started a new job. To celebrate, I decided to throw a small get-together at my apartment with a few friends and some food. I ordered a large pizza, knowing that it would be more than enough for everyone. I texted Jake to check what toppings he wanted, and he requested half pepperoni and half veggie, which I thought was a bit odd since he usually eats meat.

The night of the gathering, everyone showed up, and we all had a great time. I made sure to save a couple of slices for Jake since he said he was going to arrive a little later. As the night went on, I noticed that everyone was really enjoying the pizza, and before I knew it, the whole thing was gone except for the two slices I saved.

When Jake finally arrived, he casually asked about the pizza, and I proudly told him that we finished it all except for the two slices I kept for him. I handed him the two slices, and he looked disappointed. He took a bite of one slice and immediately said it was cold and not as good as fresh pizza. I jokingly told him to microwave it if he wanted it warm, but he snapped back that I didn’t need to save it for him if I wouldn’t even make sure it was fresh.

Feeling a bit defensive, I told him that he was acting like a child over pizza and didn’t really need to make a big deal out of it. He got frustrated and left, saying he didn’t want to hang out with someone who couldn’t even be a decent friend.

I expressed my concerns to my brother, explaining that I would feel a little hurt if their wedding took precedence over my special day. Instead of being understanding, he seemed annoyed and told me it was their day, and I should be happy for them. 

I took it a step further and suggested that they move the wedding date to a different month, or at least a week or two away from my birthday, to avoid any overlap. I even offered to help them find a different venue or date that wouldn't conflict. I thought I was being helpful by trying to make it work for everyone. 

He and his fiancé were clearly upset with my suggestion and told me that it was unfair of me to ask them to change their plans for my birthday. I got defensive and argued that since I was helping with the wedding, I should have a say in the date. I now feel like I might have overstepped, but I still believe my birthday is important too. 

So, AITA for asking my brother to change his wedding date because it’s close to my birthday?",786,2519,0.87,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_47487,2023-04-27 00:00:00,YTA,1856,AITA
You're the Asshole,"throwaway account because I don't want anyone I know to find this.

I’m a 28f and my best friend, Sarah, is getting married in a few weeks. I’m really excited for her big day. However, my boyfriend, Jake, has been acting strangely about it. He mentioned he has a bad feeling about the wedding and thinks I should skip it to spend more time with him instead. 

I told him that I couldn’t miss Sarah’s wedding, especially since I’m one of her bridesmaids. Jake suggested that instead of going to the wedding, I could spend the weekend with him at his parents' house, which he said would be a great way for us to bond. I reiterated that I really want to be there for Sarah.

In the days leading up to the wedding, I found out that Sarah had a plus-one for her reception but no one to invite since most of her friends are already committed to other plans. I offered to bring Jake as my plus-one, but he said he wasn’t interested in going to a wedding. 

So, I decided to ask my other friend, Mike, if he wanted to come with me instead. Mike is single, and we’ve hung out a few times, but we’re not romantically involved. I told Jake about the change in plans, and he flipped out, accusing me of prioritizing my friendship over our relationship and saying it was disrespectful to go with another guy.

I thought it would be fun to have Mike as a date, and I really didn’t see the big deal since Jake would be at home. Now I’m wondering if I messed up by inviting Mike instead of just going alone or trying to convince Jake to come.

You're the Asshole,"A few weeks ago, my best friend invited me to her baby shower. She's been super excited about becoming a mom, and I was thrilled for her. However, I couldn’t help but feel a bit bitter about my own situation. I’ve been trying to get pregnant for a couple of years now with no success, and seeing her so happy made me reflect on my own struggles.

During the shower, we were doing a game where everyone had to guess the baby’s gender based on the gifts she received. When it came time for my turn, I jokingly said, “Well, if it’s a girl, at least she’ll have better luck getting pregnant than I did!” I laughed it off, thinking it was just a light-hearted jab at my own misfortunes, but the room went silent. My friend looked really hurt, and I could see she was trying to hold back tears.

After the shower, she texted me saying that my comment was thoughtless and really upset her. I didn’t think it was that big of a deal, but I did apologize. I just thought I was being funny and relatable since we talk about our struggles openly. My other friends, when I brought it up, just told me that I should have kept my mouth shut.

A couple of months ago, my younger sister, Emily, got engaged. She was over the moon and wanted a big wedding, which is totally understandable. She asked me to be her maid of honor, and, of course, I said yes. Emily has always been a bit of a free spirit, and she wanted a wedding that reflected her personality—super casual and fun, but also a little unconventional.

Well, as the planning progressed, Emily started asking for my input on various details. I got really invested in the whole process, maybe a little too much. I ended up disagreeing with several of her choices, like the venue and the color scheme. I thought they were tacky and suggested more traditional options. Emily was really excited about her ideas, but I couldn't help but voice my opinions. I thought I was just trying to help her make the best decisions.

Things escalated when I suggested that she should rethink her idea of having a food truck at the reception. I was honest and told her I thought it would look cheap and ruin the vibe. She got really upset and said it was her day, not mine, and that I was being controlling. I brushed it off, thinking she was just being overly emotional.

Then, in a moment of frustration, I told her that if she wanted to throw a ""trashy"" wedding, she could do it without my support. I realized afterward that I had gone too far. She was devastated, and our relationship has been strained since. I feel terrible because I care about her and want her to be happy, but I also thought I was just being honest and looking out for her.

He’s always been there for me, and I wanted to make sure he had a great time. However, I’ve been feeling a bit insecure about my own life lately, particularly my job situation, and it affected how I acted at the party.

When we got to the venue, I noticed my friend was receiving a lot of attention for his recent promotion at work. Everyone was congratulating him, and instead of being genuinely happy for him, I let my jealousy get the better of me. I started making sarcastic comments about how he only got the promotion because he was ""the favorite"" at the office and that it must be nice to be so lucky.

At first, people laughed, but as the night went on, I kept pushing it. I brought up how I was still stuck in a dead-end job while he was moving up in the world. I thought I was joking, but my friend’s mood shifted, and he looked visibly upset. I didn't stop there, though. I even suggested that maybe he should just ""buy everyone drinks since he’s suddenly so wealthy.""

Eventually, my friend pulled me aside and told me that I was ruining his birthday and that my comments were hurtful. I brushed it off, saying I was just joking, and that he was being overly sensitive. Later, he ended up leaving the party early, and I didn't even apologize.

The next day, he texted me saying that he needed some space because he felt hurt and disrespected by my behavior. I couldn't understand why he was so upset. I thought I was just trying to keep things light and funny.

You're the Asshole,"My partner and I recently celebrated our anniversary, and I wanted to do something special. I decided to plan a surprise dinner at a fancy restaurant that I knew my partner loved. I went all out, making reservations a month in advance and even ordering a beautiful bouquet of flowers to have ready when we arrived.

The day of the dinner, I got an idea that I thought would be a fun surprise. My partner has a big sweet tooth and loves dessert, so I secretly arranged for a custom cake from a well-known bakery in town. I picked it up before we headed to the restaurant and planned to surprise my partner with it after the meal.

However, I didn’t think to ask my partner if they had any dietary restrictions or food allergies. When we got to the restaurant and finished our main course, I brought out the cake. I was so excited to see my partner's face light up, but instead, they looked concerned. It turns out that they are allergic to nuts, and I hadn't realized that the cake I ordered contained almond flour.

My partner’s face fell when they saw the cake, and they told me they couldn't eat it. I felt embarrassed and upset, but instead of apologizing, I tried to brush it off by saying, “It’s just a cake, why are you making a big deal out of it? You can just enjoy it visually!” I insisted that it was the thought that counted and that we could still have a great evening.

Eventually, my partner became upset and left the table to step outside for some fresh air. I felt hurt that they were so bothered by something that I thought was supposed to be a fun surprise. When they returned, they told me they needed a moment to collect themselves and that they felt like I didn’t care about their feelings.

I later spoke with friends about it, and they all agreed that I should have checked for allergies first. I still think I was just trying to do something nice, but I can see how my response to my partner's disappointment could have been better.

He stays up really late playing video games, rarely cooks for himself, and orders takeout almost every night. I’ve tried to encourage him to join me for meals or suggest healthier options, but he brushes it off.

Last week, I got really fed up with it. I snapped and told him that he’s being lazy and that he needs to take control of his life. I said it’s embarrassing to see him waste his potential and that he should really start taking better care of himself. I thought I was being a good friend by giving him tough love.

He didn’t take it well and got really upset, saying that I didn’t understand what he was going through and that he was dealing with a lot of stress. I told him he should just “get over it” and start acting like an adult. Now he’s been avoiding me, and our other friends have said I was too harsh and rude.

How about you try a new hobby that doesn’t involve feeding us sweets?” I thought it was funny at the time, but Lisa looked really hurt and didn’t respond. 

The next day, I overheard her telling another coworker how I made her feel bad for her baking. I felt a bit guilty but shrugged it off. I thought she was being overly sensitive and that it was just a harmless joke. 

Then, on Friday, she brought in some muffins that she made. I didn't want to seem rude, so I took one, but I didn’t eat it. I put it in my bag to take home, thinking I’d give it to my partner.

I work long hours and often come home exhausted, and I’ve mentioned to my girlfriend that I think it would be nice if her daughter could help out a bit more around the house. I suggested that she could do some light chores, like cleaning up after herself or maybe even helping to prepare dinner a couple of times a week. I thought this would teach her some responsibility since she’s getting older and it would take some of the burden off my girlfriend, who is often busy with work.

When I brought it up to the daughter, I said something like, “It would be awesome if you could help make dinner once in a while. I know you have some free time during the day!” She looked really taken aback and told me that she doesn’t think it’s her job to cook or clean since she’s just a kid. I felt a bit frustrated, so I told her that it’s not about being a kid or an adult; it’s about contributing to the household. I reminded her that I work hard all day and that it wouldn’t hurt to pitch in a little.

After that, she became really quiet and didn’t say much. I noticed she was upset, and my girlfriend later told me that I might have come off a bit too strong. I think I was just trying to encourage her to be more responsible, but now I feel bad because I might have made her uncomfortable.

She’s been in and out of therapy and has recently started opening up to me about her feelings. I really want to support her, but I also have a pretty busy life with work and my own issues.

Last month, Sarah reached out to me, feeling particularly low. She asked if I could spend some time with her or if I could help her find a support group. I, however, had plans to go to a concert with friends that I had been looking forward to for months. Instead of being understanding and supportive, I brushed her off and told her that I was too busy to help her this time.

A couple of weeks later, she reached out again, asking if I could at least text her some encouragement. I didn't respond for a few days because I was caught up in my own stuff. When I finally did, I sent a quick message saying, ""Hope you're doing okay. Can't talk much, busy."" I thought I was being nice, but looking back, I realize it was pretty dismissive.

I told her that I would give her $200 a month, but only if she could show me that she was cutting back on her non-essential spending.

I told her that if she really wanted to make it work, she needed to stop spending money on things that weren’t necessary. I suggested that she could cook more at home, stop buying coffee every day, and maybe even sell some of the things she doesn't use anymore.

You're the Asshole,"Hello everyone, I’m posting here for the first time because I need some perspective on a recent situation.

I (27, male) have a younger sister, Emma (23), who just got engaged to her boyfriend, Jake (26). They’ve been dating for about a year, and while I was initially supportive, I’ve started having concerns about their relationship. 

Jake is a nice enough guy, but he seems to have a bit of a lazy streak. For example, he moved into Emma’s apartment after a few months of dating, and he doesn’t contribute much to the household. Emma works hard to pay the rent and utilities, while Jake often just plays video games or hangs out with friends. Whenever I visit, I can see her doing all the chores while he sits around. 

The turning point for me was when Emma invited me to dinner a few nights ago to celebrate their engagement. I was happy for her and congratulated them, but during the dinner, I noticed that Jake hardly interacted with her and seemed more interested in his phone than my sister. When I mentioned this to Emma, I was met with defensiveness. I told her I thought she deserved better than someone who doesn’t seem to care about her or their future together.

I ended up saying some pretty harsh things, suggesting that she was making a mistake by getting engaged to someone who doesn't really support her. Emma got really upset and said I was being controlling and unsupportive. She pointed out that she’s an adult and can make her own choices. I tried to explain that I was just worried about her happiness, but all it did was escalate the argument.

I’ve told him multiple times that it’s a tough industry and that he would need to go where the jobs are, which is not in our small town. I’ve also very clearly stated that if he chose to pursue this path, he would need to figure out how to pay for it himself. He shrugged it off, saying he would “figure it out.”

Fast forward to now, my daughter got accepted into a great vet school, and I’m thrilled to help her with tuition. My son then came to me and asked for financial support for game design school. I reminded him of our previous conversations, explaining that I simply can’t justify spending thousands on an education that may not lead to a stable job. He got really upset and said I was being unfair, especially since I was paying for my daughter’s schooling. 

I told him that he needs to be realistic about his choices and that he’s had plenty of time to think about his future. He accused me of favoring his sister and not believing in his dreams, but I don’t want to waste money on something that’s not practical. He should have known better than to expect me to pay for something so uncertain.

You're the Asshole,"I'm 25 and have a close group of friends that I've known since high school. A few months ago, I decided to throw a big birthday party for myself at my apartment. I was really excited about it, and I invited everyone, including my friend Sarah, who is 24 and has been dealing with some tough personal issues lately. 

I knew Sarah was going through a lot, and I wanted to make sure she felt included, so I specifically reached out to her and told her how much I wanted her to come. I even offered to help her with getting a ride since she doesn't have a car. She said she'd think about it, but as the party got closer, I noticed she seemed to be distancing herself from the group.

The day before the party, I reached out to Sarah again, and she told me she was feeling really overwhelmed and anxious and that she didn’t think she could make it. I was disappointed but tried to be understanding. However, I was also feeling frustrated because I had put so much effort into planning the party, and I really wanted her to be there.

So, the day of the party, I decided to make a group chat with all my friends to hype everyone up, and I accidentally included a message that was directed at Sarah about how I was bummed she wasn't coming. I said something like, “It’s going to be so much fun, and it’s a shame Sarah won’t be there to enjoy it with us.” Well, that message got back to Sarah, and she was really hurt. 

Instead of apologizing, I got defensive. I told her that she should have just come if she really wanted to, and that it was her choice to miss out on the fun. I felt like I was justified in my frustration since I had tried so hard to include her. Now, she’s upset with me, and our friendship feels strained.

Looking back, I realize I could have handled the situation better and been more understanding of her feelings instead of making her feel bad for not attending.

A few months ago, my younger sister, Lily, got engaged to her long-term boyfriend. They were both really excited, and I was happy for them. However, I've always had a complicated relationship with my sister. Growing up, I often felt overshadowed by her. She was the ""golden child"" who excelled in academics and was always the center of attention.

When it came time to plan her wedding, I was thrilled to help out. I offered to assist with decorations and even suggested a few venues. However, I started noticing that every time I made a suggestion, Lily would dismiss it or say it wasn't ""her style."" It stung a little, but I tried to push through and keep being supportive.

As the wedding approached, she asked me to be her maid of honor, which I was honored to accept. But then she started making comments about wanting everything to be perfect, and how it needed to reflect her vision. I thought that meant she wanted my ideas, but it quickly became clear she only wanted me to follow her directions.

A week before the wedding, Lily asked me to help her set up the venue. I spent hours arranging flowers and putting up decorations just as she instructed. However, the day before the wedding, I accidentally knocked over a decorative piece she was particularly attached to. She flipped out on me, saying I was ruining her day and that I was so selfish for not paying attention.

In a moment of frustration, I told her that maybe if she weren't so controlling, things wouldn't be so stressful. She ended up in tears, and I felt bad but also thought she needed to hear it. I went home, feeling justified in my frustration.

The wedding went on as planned, but now she's barely speaking to me. Our parents think I should apologize, but I really don’t see the need. I was just expressing how I felt after being treated like a stagehand instead of her sister.

They decided to have a small, intimate wedding, and they wanted me to be the maid of honor, which I felt honored to accept.

However, when the date for the wedding was set, I realized it coincided with a big music festival that I had bought tickets for months in advance. This festival was a dream for me, featuring my favorite bands, and I didn’t want to miss it. I told my brother and his fiancée about the conflict, and while they were disappointed, I insisted I couldn’t miss the festival.

Last week, after he canceled our dinner for the third time in a row because he ""wasn’t feeling up to it,"" I snapped. I told him that he was being really selfish and that I was tired of always being the one who has to adapt to his needs. I said that if he couldn’t make an effort to meet me halfway, I couldn’t keep being there for him. 

In retrospect, I realize I could have approached the situation with more empathy. Instead of expressing my concerns in a kind way, I let my frustration boil over and hurt him. Now he doesn't want to talk, and I feel awful about how I handled it.

I booked a cabin in the mountains, and I organized everything: the food, the itinerary, all of it. I was really excited to surprise her with this trip. However, I didn’t consider that she had some big projects due at work, and she had mentioned a few times that she needed to put in extra hours to finish on time.

We went on the trip, but she ended up spending most of the time on her laptop, trying to meet her deadlines. I felt frustrated and disappointed because I wanted to spend quality time with her. Instead of being understanding, I ended up snapping at her for “ruining our getaway” and told her she should have just said no to the trip if she wasn’t going to commit to it.

In the end, she was really upset, and we had a huge fight. I thought I was being a good partner by planning this surprise, but I realize now that I didn’t take her feelings or responsibilities into account.

When she asked me to go dress shopping with her, I agreed, but I was still feeling a bit insecure about my place in her life. While we were trying on dresses, I noticed she chose a style that I had worn to another friend’s wedding a couple of years ago. I pointed it out to her, and jokingly said something like, ""Wow, I hope you don't think I'm trying to relive my glory days through your wedding!"" 

She laughed at first, but then her face changed, and she told me that she wanted her wedding to be unique and special and that it would mean a lot to her if I could support her choices without bringing up my past. Instead of apologizing, I got defensive and said, ""It’s just a dress, it's not like I’m stealing your thunder!"" 

After that, the mood shifted, and she seemed upset with me for the rest of the shopping trip. I didn't really understand why she was so sensitive about it.

My friend has been going through a tough time lately. She lost her job a couple of months ago and has been really stressed about finding a new one. I’ve been trying to be supportive, checking in on her, and offering to help with her resume and job applications. 

Recently, she told me about an interview she had coming up for a position she really wanted. I was excited for her and asked if she wanted to practice some interview questions together. She seemed a bit hesitant, saying she wanted to prepare on her own first. I respected that, but I couldn’t help but feel like I could offer some valuable insight since I’ve been through a lot of interviews myself.

The day before her interview, I texted her to see how her prep was going. I jokingly asked if she was ready to get grilled by me, and she responded that she really didn’t want to do a mock interview and just wanted to relax. I pushed a bit, telling her that she could use the practice and that I was just trying to help. I guess I didn’t pick up on her frustration because I kept insisting, saying things like “You’ll thank me later when you ace this interview!”

Eventually, she snapped at me, saying that she didn’t need my help and that I was being overbearing. I got defensive and told her that I was just trying to be a good friend and that she was being ungrateful. We ended up having a huge argument, and she told me to leave her alone. I was hurt and didn’t understand why she couldn’t appreciate my efforts.

Afterward, I thought about the situation and realized maybe I had crossed a line by not respecting her wishes. But at the same time, I felt like I was just trying to help her succeed. Now I’m worried that I might have ruined our friendship and want to know if I was the asshole in this situation. AITA?",778,752,0.66,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_63359,2021-12-29 00:00:00,YTA,1994,AITA
You're the Asshole,"My 10-year-old son has always been a bit of a picky eater. He mostly sticks to his favorite foods, like mac and cheese, chicken nuggets, and pizza. I've tried everything to get him to expand his palate, but nothing seems to work. Recently, I decided to take a more drastic approach to encourage him to try new things.

One evening, I made a nice stir-fry with a variety of colorful vegetables and some chicken. When he came to the table, I told him that if he didn’t try at least one bite of the stir-fry, he would have to go to bed without dessert. He looked at the plate in horror and begged me not to make him eat it. I refused to budge, insisting that he had to try it to get his dessert.

After some tears and pleading, he reluctantly took a tiny bite and immediately grimaced. I laughed and told him to stop being dramatic and that he might actually like it if he gave it a chance. When he pushed his plate away, I got frustrated and took away his dessert for the night. He ended up crying at the table, and I felt like I was teaching him a valuable lesson about trying new foods.

Afterwards, I saw how upset he was and felt a twinge of guilt, but I still believe I was in the right for holding my ground. AITA?",781,720,0.55,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_42986,2020-12-06 00:00:00,YTA,1218,AITA
You're the Asshole,"So, I recently started working from home, and I’ve been enjoying the flexibility it gives me. I share my apartment with my girlfriend, and things have generally been good between us. 

However, I have a habit of blasting my music while I work. I love listening to heavy metal, and I crank it up to help me focus. My girlfriend has mentioned a few times that it’s too loud and interrupts her work, especially when she’s on video calls for her job. I just shrugged it off, saying that I need the music to stay motivated.

Last week, she asked me again to lower the volume while she was in a meeting. I got frustrated and told her that I pay half the rent, so I should be able to enjoy my music at the volume I want. I even joked that if she couldn’t handle it, she should find a quiet place to work instead. 

She looked upset, and I felt a little guilty, but honestly, I think she’s overreacting. It’s my space too, and I shouldn’t have to change how I work because of her.

You're the Asshole,"A few months ago, my best friend asked me to be a bridesmaid at her wedding. I was thrilled and agreed without hesitation. She’s been planning this wedding for over a year, and I’ve been helping her with the details as much as I can. However, I didn’t realize how much my own personal plans would clash with her wedding date.

A couple of weeks after I agreed to be a bridesmaid, I found out that my favorite band was going to be performing in a city about five hours away on the same weekend as her wedding. This concert was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I’ve been a fan of this band for years. I decided that I would go to the concert instead of being at the wedding.

I didn’t think it would be a big deal, so I told my friend about my decision a few weeks before the big day. I thought she would understand since I had been so supportive of her planning. Instead, she was heartbroken and felt betrayed. She told me it wasn’t just a wedding but a significant moment in her life, and she really needed me there by her side.

I felt guilty for a moment, but I justified my decision by thinking that I could always catch up with her later and that the concert would be a much better experience for me. After all, it’s not like I would be missing out on something I could do later. I told her to enjoy her day and that I would send her a gift instead. 

Now, she hasn’t spoken to me in weeks, and I feel like I made the right choice for myself. AITA for choosing the concert over my best friend's wedding?",572,2574,0.57,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_10516,2019-07-02 00:00:00,YTA,1512,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I (28F) have been friends with Jessica (27F) for several years, and we decided to move in together about a year ago. Things started off great, but recently, I've been feeling really frustrated with her. 

Jessica has always been a bit of a neat freak, which I respected at first. However, she has become increasingly obsessed with cleanliness and organization. She started making rules about how the apartment should be kept. For example, she insists that we both do a deep clean every Sunday, which I don’t mind, but it feels like she takes over and dictates how everything should be cleaned. If I don’t do it her way, she gets upset and even redoes the tasks I’ve completed.

The turning point came recently when she borrowed one of my favorite sweaters without asking. When I noticed it was missing, I found it crumpled up in her room. I confronted her about it, and instead of apologizing, she said it was in a “better place” because her room is cleaner. I lost my temper and told her that it was my property and I expected her to respect my things.

After that, I decided to take things a step further. I started leaving passive-aggressive notes around the apartment about how she should be more respectful of my space and my belongings. I made comments about how her need for order was becoming too much and that it was suffocating. I thought I was being humorous, but she took it seriously and ended up crying over it.

Now, Jessica is considering moving out because she feels unwelcome in her own home. I think she’s overreacting, but my other friends have started to tell me that I might be the problem. I just wanted her to understand how I felt, but now I’m worried I pushed her away. AITA?",778,1940,0.73,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_57460,2021-04-26 00:00:00,YTA,1701,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I (32F) recently had a falling out with my sister (30F) over her wedding plans. She’s getting married next year and is really excited about it. However, she’s been pushing for a very extravagant, over-the-top wedding. I understand it’s her special day, but it feels like she’s lost sight of what’s truly important, and I’ve tried to talk to her about it.

One day, she called me in tears, upset because our parents were hesitant about spending so much money on her wedding. I suggested that she should consider scaling things back to something more manageable. I thought this would help her not only save money but also alleviate some of the stress she seemed to be under. I mentioned that a simple ceremony could be just as beautiful and memorable.

Well, she didn’t take the suggestion well at all. She accused me of not supporting her dreams and said I was being a “dream killer.” I tried to explain that I was coming from a place of care, but she hung up on me. Since then, she hasn’t spoken to me, and it’s been really tense between us.

I feel bad that she’s upset, but I can’t shake the feeling that I was just trying to help her see things more clearly. Our family is not wealthy, and I genuinely believe she’ll regret spending so much on a single day. I’ve been venting to my friends about it, and they’ve mostly sided with me, saying I was looking out for her best interests.

Now, I’m starting to wonder if maybe I was too harsh or if I should have just kept my opinions to myself.

You're the Asshole,"So, recently I’ve been working on this group project for my university course, and things haven't been going well. There are four of us in the group, and we were supposed to collaborate on a presentation for our class. From the beginning, I took charge because I thought I had the most experience, and I didn’t really trust my teammates to pull their weight.

One of my teammates, Sarah, was really enthusiastic about her ideas, but I found them a bit silly and impractical. Instead of discussing her ideas constructively, I started shutting her down during our meetings, making sarcastic comments about how we should stick to “realistic” approaches. I remember telling her, “Maybe leave the creative stuff to the art majors,” which was completely uncalled for.

As the deadline approached, I took it upon myself to do most of the work. I ended up rewriting her portion of the presentation without asking for her input, thinking I was just making it better. When I presented it to the group, Sarah was visibly upset and said she felt like her contributions were ignored and belittled. But instead of listening, I defended my choices, insisting that I was just trying to make the project stronger.

Afterward, the other group members told me I was being too harsh on Sarah and that I should apologize for how I treated her. I brushed it off, thinking I was justified in wanting to deliver a solid project. Now I’m left wondering if I was too dismissive and if I owe her an apology.",68,2857,0.83,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_16768,2021-04-18 00:00:00,YTA,1480,AITA
You're the Asshole,"So, I recently went to a popular coffee shop in my city that’s known for its artisanal lattes and cozy atmosphere. I had been looking forward to this visit all week because I was craving their seasonal pumpkin spice latte. When I arrived, there was a long line, but I didn’t mind because I was excited about my drink.

As I stood there, I overheard a couple in front of me talking about their coffee orders. They were taking their sweet time deciding, and it felt like they were holding up the line. After about 10 minutes, I noticed that the barista was struggling to keep up with the orders, and I was getting really impatient.

In a moment of frustration, I decided that I had waited long enough. I leaned forward and asked the couple if they could hurry up a bit since everyone else was waiting. They gave me a dirty look but didn’t say anything, so I figured I could just go up to the counter and place my order instead.

When I reached the front, the barista greeted me, and I ordered my pumpkin spice latte. However, just as I was finishing, the couple turned around and started complaining about how rude I was for cutting in line. Instead of apologizing, I snapped back at them, saying that they were the ones taking forever and that I had every right to order since I was waiting just like everyone else.

Things escalated quickly, and I ended up raising my voice, which drew the attention of the other customers. I could feel the tension in the air, and I noticed people staring at me. The barista even looked uncomfortable. I didn’t care though; I was determined to get my drink.

After I paid and walked out, I realized that I had made a scene and embarrassed myself. My friends who were with me said I should have just waited my turn and not engaged with the couple like that. I thought I was justified in my actions, but looking back, I can see how I might have come off as the rude one.

A few weeks ago, my younger sister got engaged to her boyfriend of two years, and they are planning a big wedding next summer. She has always dreamed of a fairy-tale wedding, and I want to support her as much as I can. 

However, I’ve been engaged for six months now, and my fiancé and I have been planning a small, intimate wedding for this fall. We decided to keep it simple and stress-free due to work commitments and the costs associated with a larger wedding. I really thought my sister would be excited for me and my plans.

When I told her about our wedding date, her reaction was not what I expected. She seemed upset that I was getting married before her and expressed that it made her feel like my wedding would overshadow hers. I tried to reassure her that this wasn’t my intention at all; I just wanted to celebrate our love in a way that felt right for us. But she couldn’t get over it, and I could tell it was bothering her.

Feeling frustrated, I ended up saying something that I now regret: I told her that she shouldn’t worry about my wedding because hers would be the bigger event, and mine was just a ""practice run"" for her. Looking back, I realize that was a pretty insensitive thing to say. 

Now she’s not speaking to me, and my parents think I was out of line. I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings, but I was just trying to get her to see that our weddings don’t need to compete with each other.

Recently, I noticed that one of my coworkers, Sarah, has been trying to promote her side business selling handmade jewelry. She’s really passionate about it, and I can see how hard she’s working to make it successful. However, I find her constant talks about her business to be a little annoying, especially since she brings it up at every lunch.

Last week, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I planned a surprise ""intervention"" during our lunch break. I gathered all our coworkers and told Sarah that we wanted to support her business. I proceeded to make a big show of how we should all buy her jewelry, but I exaggerated a lot about how terrible it is. I said things like, ""Are you sure these won't give us an allergic reaction?"" and ""I wouldn't want to wear something that looks like it came from a craft fair.""

While I thought it was all in good fun, Sarah looked absolutely crushed, and the others were clearly uncomfortable. Afterward, she left the lunch early, and I heard later from a couple of coworkers that she was really hurt by what I said.

You're the Asshole,"I need some perspective because I feel like I'm in a tough spot with my family. So, here’s the situation: I'm 30 and I've been living with my older sister (34) for the past year after a rough breakup. My sister has been great, and I really appreciate her support. The problem is that I’ve gotten pretty comfortable living with her, maybe too comfortable.

I work from home, and I’ve developed a habit of staying up late watching TV and playing video games. I usually go to bed around 3 AM and sleep until noon. My sister, on the other hand, is a morning person; she gets up around 6 AM for her job and likes to keep a routine. I've noticed that my late nights and sleeping in have started to affect her. She’s mentioned that she can hear me playing games during the night, and it keeps her awake at times. But I feel like she’s just being a bit dramatic about it.

Last week, she had a particularly rough day at work and came home exhausted. I was in the middle of a gaming session when she knocked on my door and asked me to keep it down. I told her I was having fun and that she should just wear earplugs if it bothers her that much. I didn’t mean to be rude, but I felt like she was overreacting. 

Later that week, she confronted me again, saying that my habits were affecting her mental health and that she needed a peaceful home to unwind after work. I got defensive and argued that I was just living my life and she could adjust to it. I suggested that she could just try to go to bed earlier if she wanted more sleep.

Since then, there’s been a bit of tension, and I feel like I’m stuck between wanting to enjoy my own space and not wanting to upset her. I think I’m just trying to live my life as I want to, but I also don’t want to be the source of conflict in her home.

They’ve only been together for about 6 months, and while I’m happy for him, I can’t help but feel concerned about how quickly things are moving. My brother has always been impulsive, and I worry that he doesn’t really know what he’s getting into with marriage.

I’ve met his fiancée a few times, and while she seems nice, I feel like I don’t really know her well enough to trust her with my brother’s happiness.

I even mentioned that she should look into getting a part-time job after the baby is born so they don’t fall into financial trouble.

At one family gathering, I took it a step further and suggested that since they’re painting the nursery, they should choose neutral colors so they can reuse the room for future children, considering how expensive it can be to raise a family. I made a joke about how they might need to be careful about having too many kids if they want to afford a decent lifestyle. It was meant to be light-hearted, but Emily didn’t laugh and looked visibly upset.

When my niece was born, my brother asked for my help, since I’ve always been the one in our family who loved taking care of kids. I was more than happy to help out, but I’ve noticed that my brother and his girlfriend are quite laid-back when it comes to parenting. They’re very lax about her schedule and eating habits, which I find concerning.

My brother’s girlfriend is a firm believer in “let the baby eat what she wants” and “she’ll sleep when she’s tired.” I understand that every parent has their own style, but I feel that some structure is important, especially with food. I’ve suggested they try offering her more nutritious foods and establishing a bedtime routine, but they brush it off, saying “she's just a baby” and will “figure it out.”

Recently, during a visit, I brought over some homemade baby food that I had prepared. It was all organic and healthy. I thought they’d appreciate it, but instead, they seemed offended. They said I was trying to impose my views on them and that their daughter would eat when she’s ready. I was trying to help, but it felt like they were dismissing my efforts.

You're the Asshole,"So, here’s the deal. My best friend, Mia, has been dating this guy, Jake, for a little over a year now. They seem really happy together, and I’m genuinely happy for them. However, there’s one thing that really irks me about their relationship: Jake has a terrible habit of interrupting Mia whenever she’s talking, and it drives me up the wall. 

I never really said anything to Mia about it, but I would catch myself making faces every time Jake cut her off. I thought, ""Maybe she’ll notice it too and bring it up,"" but she seemed oblivious. I’ve tried to give them space when they’re together, but I couldn’t help it—every time we hung out, I would find myself pointing out how rude he was being whenever he interrupted her. 

One day, during a small get-together at my place, Mia was sharing a story about her work, and Jake interrupted her, yet again, to tell a completely unrelated joke. I snapped and said, ""Can you let her finish for once? It’s really rude to interrupt someone when they’re talking."" 

Mia looked visibly upset, and Jake shot me a glare. Afterward, Mia pulled me aside and said I embarrassed her in front of Jake and that I should have kept my opinion to myself. I didn’t mean to upset her, but I felt like someone needed to stand up for her. Now she’s been distant with me, and I feel like maybe I overstepped. 

I thought I was just trying to advocate for my friend, but now I’m wondering if I was actually an asshole for calling Jake out in front of her.",595,1165,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_95072,2024-04-17 00:00:00,YTA,1480,AITA
You're the Asshole,"Throwaway account for privacy.

So, I (29M) have been friends with this guy, let's call him Dave (30M), for years. We met in college and have always had a pretty tight friendship. Recently, Dave started dating this girl, who I'll call Sarah (28F). They've been together for about six months now.

Now, I know it's kind of weird, but I have developed a crush on Sarah. I mean, she's really cool, and we click on a lot of levels. I know that it’s not great to feel this way about my best friend's girlfriend, but I can't help it. I never acted on my feelings, at least not directly.

A few weeks ago, Dave invited me to hang out with them at a bar. While we were there, Sarah and I ended up having a really fun conversation, laughing and joking around. I could sense that there was some chemistry between us, and maybe I misread the situation, but I thought it would be harmless to flirt a little.

Well, it didn’t go over well. Dave noticed what I was doing and got really upset. He confronted me later and said I was being disrespectful and crossing a line. I honestly just thought we were all having a good time, and I didn’t think it was that big of a deal since I wasn’t trying to steal her away or anything. I mean, it's not like they’re engaged or anything, right?

Since then, Dave has been giving me the cold shoulder, and I feel like I might have ruined our friendship. I talked to Sarah, and she said she felt uncomfortable with my flirting but didn’t want to cause drama. I guess I thought I could just brush it off, but now I realize that it was probably a bad move.

So here I am, wondering if I’m the asshole for flirting with my best friend's girlfriend. I didn't mean to hurt anyone, but now I feel like I might have overstepped. What do you think?",707,1633,0.67,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_99625,2020-12-02 00:00:00,YTA,1763,AITA

You're the Asshole,"I (32F) recently had a pretty big fight with my best friend, Sarah (31F), over a vacation plan. We’ve been friends for years and usually travel together, so when I planned a trip to Hawaii with my boyfriend, I thought it would be a great idea to invite her along. However, I was really clear from the start that I wouldn’t be able to cover her expenses, as my boyfriend and I had already budgeted for the trip and were paying for most of it ourselves.

Sarah seemed excited at first, but then she started talking about all the things she wanted to do while we were there, like going on fancy dinners and taking expensive excursions. I tried to explain that we would be sticking to a fairly tight budget and that her additional costs would really add up. I even suggested cheaper alternatives for activities, but she brushed them off.

As the trip approached, I could tell she was getting more frustrated and started making comments like, “You just don’t understand how much fun I could have if I could spend more.” It really annoyed me because I felt like she was being ungrateful. I told her that if she wasn’t able to afford the trip, maybe she should reconsider going instead of expecting me to change my plans.

The night before we were supposed to leave, Sarah called me in tears, saying she felt excluded and that I was being selfish for not covering her expenses. I snapped and told her that I wasn’t her bank and that she needed to be responsible for her own finances. I ended up telling her not to come if she couldn’t handle it.

He’s a bright kid but has had some personal issues at home that have affected his performance. I've been trying to help him by offering extra tutoring sessions and being understanding about his late assignments.

Last week, I found out that Jake was also being bullied by a few of his classmates. Instead of addressing the issue with the kids, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I confronted the bullies in front of the entire class and called them out for their behavior, which I thought was justified. I told them they were disgraceful and that they should be ashamed of themselves.

However, I realized that my outburst not only embarrassed the bullies but also made the situation worse for Jake. The bullies retaliated by targeting him even more. My intention was to protect Jake and make a stand against bullying, but I ended up making things much harder for him.

I’ve since apologized to Jake for my approach and tried to support him further, but I can’t shake the feeling that I overstepped.

I (30M) have a younger brother, Jake (27M), who just got engaged to his long-term girlfriend, Sarah. They decided to have a small engagement party at a nice restaurant, and they invited our immediate family and a few close friends. The event was set for Saturday at 5 PM, and I was really excited to celebrate with them.

The problem is that I had a golf game scheduled for that same Saturday afternoon. I play in a semi-competitive league, and we had a big match that week against one of our biggest rivals. It was an important game, and I had already committed to my teammates that I would be there. I really enjoy playing golf, and I’ve been looking forward to this match for weeks.

When Jake sent out the invite, I realized my golf game would likely run late, but I figured I could just leave early and head to the party afterwards. I told my brother I would be a bit late, but I'd definitely make it after the game. He seemed a bit disappointed but said he understood.

On the day of the event, I’m playing my heart out on the golf course. I finish my round around 4:30, and I think I can still get to the party by 5:15. I rush to change in the parking lot, but traffic was terrible, and I finally arrived at the restaurant around 5:45. As soon as I walked in, I could tell the atmosphere was tense. The party was already well underway, and Jake looked upset to see me.

I went up to him to congratulate him and apologize for being late, but he immediately started lecturing me about how important this day was for him and Sarah. I tried to explain that I really had no control over the golf match and that I did my best to get there as quickly as I could. Honestly, I thought I was being reasonable.

The rest of the night was awkward. I kept trying to engage with family and friends, but they were all giving me the cold shoulder. At one point, Sarah pulled me aside and told me that I was being selfish for prioritizing golf over my brother’s engagement. I got defensive and said that I was just trying to have a good time while also supporting my brother.

Even after the party ended, I overheard Jake telling some family members that I didn't care about him or his engagement, and that really hurt. I feel like everyone is overreacting.

So, a few days ago, I went out with some friends to a local amusement park. We were all really excited, and I even bought a couple of overpriced snacks to share. The park was packed, and it was a hot day—definitely a mistake to wear a long-sleeve shirt.

After a few hours of rides and walking around, one of my friends, Sarah, started to feel really dizzy. She sat down on a bench and asked if anyone had some extra water. I had brought a full bottle of water with me, but I didn't want to give it to her for a couple of reasons.

First, I had planned on saving that water for myself since I was feeling pretty dehydrated too, but I thought, ""I need to keep it."" Second, earlier that day, Sarah had insisted on buying a giant soda instead of water, even after I suggested she get water to stay hydrated. I felt like she made her choice and now it wasn’t my responsibility to fix it.

She seemed pretty desperate, and while my other friends offered her their water, I just sat there sipping mine and thinking about how I wanted to enjoy the day without feeling guilty. Eventually, one of our other friends gave her some of their water, but I still felt like I made the right choice.

You're the Asshole,"Hello Reddit!

Obligatory sorry for any formatting errors, I'm on mobile.

Edit: I appreciate all the feedback so far! I've added more details in the comments for clarity.

Original:

I've been a long-time lurker on this sub, and I recently found myself in a situation that made me question if I was in the wrong. My friend, who we'll call Jess, thinks I'm an asshole, and I’m starting to wonder if she might be right.

So, a few weeks ago, I hosted a small get-together at my apartment for some friends. I had a few people over, including Jess, and we were all having a great time. I had planned a nice dinner and some games, and everything was going well until it was time for dessert.

I had baked a cake specifically for the occasion, and I was so excited to share it with everyone. When I brought it out, Jess made a comment about how she was on a diet and couldn't have any. I jokingly said, ""Well, if you’re on a diet, you can just eat a smaller piece!"" 

Jess laughed but then said she really meant it and didn't want to feel pressured to eat anything. So, I replied, ""Come on, it's just cake! You have to live a little!"" I thought I was being funny, but Jess seemed to take it the wrong way. She ended up not having any cake at all, which I thought was fine since it was her choice.

Later in the evening, I noticed she was quiet and a bit distant. When everyone else had left, she confronted me about my comment. She told me that I was being insensitive and that I should have respected her decision not to indulge in dessert rather than joking about it. I told her it was all in good fun and that she should lighten up.

Now, I feel confused. I see my comment as light-hearted and meant to be playful, but Jess clearly took it to heart. I didn’t mean to make her uncomfortable, but I also feel like she could have just laughed it off. 

AITA for joking about Jess's diet at my get-together? I thought I was just being friendly and fun, but now I’m starting to think I crossed a line.

While we were on vacation, Sarah posted on social media about how her older brother had ""bailed her out"" and that she was so grateful. I felt a bit hurt because it sounded like I had done a lot more for her than I actually had, and I felt like she was misrepresenting the situation.

When I confronted her about it, she got defensive and accused me of not supporting her when she needed it most. I told her that I didn’t appreciate her exaggerating what I did for her, and I thought it was unfair to make me look like a hero when I really just helped her out a little.

First off, they decided to co-sleep with their baby, which I've read can be really dangerous. They also often talk about how they ""let the baby cry it out"" for hours at night instead of comforting him.

The swing was on and rocking, but I was really bothered that they weren’t checking on him. I know babies can sleep for a long time, but I just thought it was irresponsible.

I recently attended a friend’s wedding, and it was a big deal for her. I was really excited to see her get married and celebrate with all our friends. I had been looking forward to the event for months. The wedding was beautiful, and everything went smoothly until the reception.

During the reception, the bride and groom had a fun tradition where they had a “dance-off” for couples, and it was hilarious to watch. As the night went on, I was feeling pretty good and had a few drinks. I thought it would be funny to join in on the fun, so I decided to go up and challenge the bride’s husband to a dance-off. I thought I’d be entertaining and playful, but I ended up making a bit of a scene.

I danced pretty wildly, not really caring about the fact that it was their special day. I thought everyone was having a good time, but I noticed the bride looking increasingly uncomfortable and upset. Instead of realizing I should stop, I kept going, trying to get more attention and laughs from the crowd. It turned into me trying to outshine the newlyweds, which was not my intention, but I got caught up in the moment.

After I finished my dance, the bride came up to me and politely asked me to sit down and let them enjoy their day. I laughed it off, thinking she was being overly sensitive. But as the night went on, I could see her mood darkening. I found out later from a mutual friend that she felt I had taken away from her moment.

The next week, I reached out to the bride to apologize, but she was still upset and told me that I had ruined a special memory for her. I felt bad but also thought it was just a dance and that I was being fun. I didn’t think I was in the wrong; I just wanted to have a good time and make people laugh.

You're the Asshole,"I’m posting this from my partner’s account to get an outside perspective on a situation that’s been bothering us lately.

My perspective (girlfriend):

My boyfriend and I have been together for over three years. Recently, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with work and personal issues, and I was really hoping to have a relaxing weekend together. My boyfriend had planned a gaming marathon with his friends, something he does pretty regularly, and I didn’t want to ruin his fun, but I also wanted some quality time with him.

On Saturday morning, I asked if we could skip the gaming marathon and just spend some time together. He said he’d think about it but was really excited about playing. I ended up getting more anxious as the day went on, and I told him I’d be unhappy if he went ahead with the marathon. I didn’t mean to put pressure on him, but I guess I got frustrated when he didn’t seem to understand how much I needed his support.

When his friends came over to start the marathon, I started to sulk a bit. I made passive-aggressive comments about how I was going to be alone all weekend while they played and how it was nice to know where his priorities were. Eventually, I left the room and went to sulk in the bedroom.

A few hours later, he came in to check on me. Instead of talking about it, I kept up my moodiness and told him I just didn’t want to talk. I could tell he was getting frustrated, and he finally said if I was going to be like this, he’d rather just play with his friends. I felt hurt and abandoned, but I didn’t really communicate that well. 

Looking back, I realize I was kind of a jerk for trying to guilt him into skipping the gaming marathon. I know it’s something he enjoys, and I should’ve just been more upfront about my feelings instead of shutting down and sulking. 

So, am I the asshole for trying to control his plans because I was feeling down? 

Boyfriend’s perspective:

My girlfriend has been feeling stressed out lately, and I’ve tried to be supportive. When she asked me to cancel the gaming marathon, I felt torn because it’s something I really enjoy. I offered to limit my time to play, but when she continued to sulk and make passive-aggressive comments, it made me feel like I couldn’t enjoy it without feeling guilty. I tried to check on her, but she wouldn’t engage, and I ended up feeling frustrated.

You're the Asshole,"So, I need some perspective on a situation that happened recently. I've been dating my boyfriend for about a year, and we’ve been pretty serious. Last month, he casually mentioned wanting to go to a concert of a band that we both like but that I hadn’t seen live yet. I was excited and thought it would be a fun experience for us to share.

However, when I went to buy tickets, I found out that it was sold out. I was really disappointed but figured I would just keep an eye on resale sites. A few days later, I noticed that my boyfriend had bought two tickets to the concert—not for us, but for him and his best friend.

When I confronted him about it, he said that he didn’t think it was a big deal since I’d never seen the band before and that he just wanted to enjoy the concert with his friend. I was hurt because I felt like he chose to go with someone else over me, especially since I had expressed an interest in going together. 

In my frustration, I told him that it was pretty inconsiderate of him to go without me and that it showed he didn’t value our relationship. He got defensive and said it was just a concert and not worth fighting over. I then told him that if he didn’t care enough to include me for something we both liked, maybe we should reconsider if we're on the same page.

You're the Asshole,"So here's my situation.

My best friend has been trying to get into a healthier lifestyle. She’s been working out regularly, eating better, and overall just trying to take care of herself more. I think it’s great, and I fully support her.

However, I’ve been feeling really insecure about my own weight and health, especially since I've been indulging a lot lately. I know I shouldn’t compare myself to her, but I can’t help it. I started making little comments about her new diet and workout routine—like how maybe she’s taking it too seriously, or that it’s okay to have a cheat day every now and then. I thought I was just lightening the mood and keeping things casual.

Last week, I invited her over for dinner and made a bunch of junk food—think pizza, wings, and dessert. I jokingly told her that she could take a break from her “health kick” and enjoy some real food. She seemed really uncomfortable and ended up leaving early. I thought it was just a joke, but now I’m realizing I may have crossed a line.

I’ve talked to some friends, and they said I was being insensitive and that I was projecting my own insecurities onto her. I thought I was just being funny and supportive in my own way, but now I’m not so sure. Should I have just kept my thoughts to myself instead of trying to make light of her efforts? 

So, am I the asshole for trying to joke about my friend's healthy lifestyle?",371,2397,0.75,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_66582,2022-05-06 00:00:00,YTA,1398,AITA
You're the Asshole,"So, I (28M) have a younger sister (23F) who recently got engaged to her long-term boyfriend. They are planning a small, intimate wedding with just family and a few close friends. My sister has always been a bit insecure about her appearance, and she's been working really hard to lose weight for the wedding. She's doing great and looks amazing, and I'm really proud of her.

However, I decided to take it upon myself to ""help"" her with her wedding planning. I thought it would be a fun idea to create a private group chat with our family and share my thoughts on her wedding dress options. I started sending them pictures of dresses I thought would look good on her, but I also included some that I thought were ""edgier"" or that she might not choose herself. I thought it would be a fun way to get everyone involved in the planning.

Well, my sister found out about the chat and was furious. She told me that she wanted to keep the wedding planning personal and not have everyone commenting on her choices. I thought I was just being supportive, but she accused me of undermining her decisions and making her feel bad about her body by suggesting dresses that were out of her comfort zone.

I honestly didn’t see what the big deal was; I was just trying to help her and get everyone excited about the wedding. I told her she was overreacting and that it's all in good fun. Now she's not speaking to me, and I feel like I might have crossed a line, but I still don't think I did anything wrong.

You're the Asshole,"My sister is 32 and I’m 29. Our parents are divorced, and ever since they separated, things have been pretty tense in the family. My dad has been struggling with his mental health since the divorce, and while I try to support him, he often takes his frustrations out on me. My sister, on the other hand, has always been more distant from him, and they barely communicate.

Last month, my dad had a medical emergency and ended up in the hospital. It was pretty serious, and I was really worried about him. I took time off work to be by his side, help with any paperwork, and manage some of his affairs. I was emotionally drained but felt it was my responsibility as his child.

After he got out of the hospital, he needed a lot of help at home. I suggested to my sister that maybe we could hire a caregiver to assist him, but she just brushed me off, saying it wasn’t necessary and that he could manage on his own. I understood her point, but I knew he needed help, especially since I had to go back to work soon.

Eventually, I decided to hire someone myself. I figured it was worth the investment for his well-being. When I told my sister about the caregiver I hired, she was furious. She accused me of wasting money and said it was unfair for me to make decisions without consulting her. I tried to explain that I was doing what I thought was best, but she kept insisting I was being inconsiderate. 

In the heat of the argument, I told her that she was just avoiding responsibility and that I was the only one stepping up to help Dad. I said she could at least contribute financially since she makes more than I do, but she refused, saying she didn’t see the need for a caregiver.

I can’t help but feel like I’m the only one trying to support our dad during this tough time. I really thought I was doing the right thing by hiring help, but now I’m starting to wonder if I overstepped.

During the party, I noticed that my friend had set up a karaoke machine. I love singing, so I started to get a little tipsy and thought it would be fun to take the mic and perform a few songs. I picked some of my favorites, but I could see that some people were starting to lose interest. Instead of noticing and taking a break, I kept going for nearly an hour.

People started chatting among themselves and completely ignoring my performance. I could feel the vibe shifting, but I powered through, thinking I was entertaining everyone. At one point, my friend even came up to me and whispered that I should let others have a turn, but I brushed them off and continued.

Eventually, someone else tried to grab the mic to sing, but I wouldn’t let them. I thought I was being funny and playful, but I could see my friend looking increasingly uncomfortable. After a few more songs, I finally finished, but the atmosphere felt awkward.

Later, I overheard some guests talking about how they were frustrated that I wouldn’t let anyone else sing, and it made me realize I might have taken it too far. I felt bad when I saw the look on my friend's face—it seemed like my performance overshadowed their celebration.

I made a reservation at a place that she had mentioned wanting to visit for months. I was really excited and thought it would be a great way to show her how much I care.

However, when we got there, she noticed the menu had a lot of seafood dishes, and she’s allergic to shellfish. I hadn’t realized this until then, and even though there were other options on the menu, she was understandably upset that I didn’t remember her allergy. Instead of being supportive and helping her find something she could eat, I got frustrated and said it was just a minor inconvenience. I insisted we stay because I had gone through the trouble to make the reservation, and I didn’t want to waste it.

She ended up feeling really uncomfortable and anxious, and we left the restaurant after a heated argument. I feel like I was justified in wanting to enjoy the evening despite the hiccup, but she thinks I was disrespectful for not considering her health and feelings first.

You're the Asshole,"So, a little backstory. 

I have a group of friends that I’ve known since high school. We all used to hang out together, but over the years, our paths have diverged. Most of my friends have gone on to pursue their careers and start families, while I’ve remained single and focused on my career in tech. 

Recently, one of my friends, Sarah, got engaged and decided to throw a huge engagement party. She invited all of our old friend group, and I was really excited to catch up and celebrate with everyone. However, I noticed that she had a strict dress code for the party: formal wear. 

I don’t own any formal clothes because I don’t have any occasions to wear them, so I decided to just wear nice jeans and a button-up shirt. I thought it would be fine since I always dress nicely and I’ve never been one to conform strictly to dress codes.

When I arrived at the party, I could tell people were looking at me funny. Sarah, upon seeing me, immediately pulled me aside and told me that I didn’t follow the dress code and that it was important to her that everyone adhered to it. I felt embarrassed, but I also thought her reaction was a bit over the top. I told her that I came to support her and that my outfit didn’t change the fact that I was there for her.

She insisted that I leave and come back in appropriate attire. I felt hurt and humiliated, but I eventually left, went home, and changed into a suit. When I returned, I felt like the atmosphere had shifted, and Sarah was still cold towards me. I stayed for the party, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of being unwelcome.

Later, I saw her chatting with other friends, and they kept glancing at me. It felt like they were talking about me. I confronted Sarah about it later and told her how I felt. She said I was being selfish for not respecting her wishes and that my attitude ruined part of her night.

When I confronted him about spending too much time with her, he said they were just hanging out and it wasn’t a big deal. I didn’t like that he was prioritizing a girl over his responsibilities, so I told him he couldn’t see her anymore unless he improved his grades.

So, a few weeks ago, my friend invited me to their birthday party, and I thought it would be nice to bring a gift. I decided to buy a fancy candle that I found at a local store. It was a bit pricey, but I thought it was something they would really enjoy since they love home decor.

Tldr at the end, turned out longer than expected

Background - My sister is getting married soon, and she has been planning her wedding for over a year now. She’s really excited about it and has been including me in a lot of the planning. I’ve always been supportive and given her my opinions on things, but I’ve also been pretty vocal about my own feelings regarding weddings in general. 

The thing is, I absolutely hate weddings. I think they’re a waste of money and a huge hassle. I’ve always told my sister that if I were to ever get married, I would just go to the courthouse and keep it simple. I even joked with her about how I would rather skip her wedding altogether if it meant I didn’t have to deal with all the drama and stress that comes with it.

Fast forward to the wedding planning reaching its peak, and my sister invited me to her bridal shower. I decided to decline, citing my belief that these events are unnecessary. I figured she would understand since I’ve been pretty open about my opinions on weddings. Plus, I thought it might be a nice way to make a statement about how I feel. 

After I declined, she was really upset and said I was being unsupportive. I told her that it was just my opinion and that I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings. I thought she’d appreciate my honesty, but she just started crying and said I was being selfish and that I was ruining this special time for her.

So, AITA for not wanting to attend my sister’s bridal shower because I think weddings are a waste of time and money?

Mike is a nice guy, but he can be a bit dull and doesn't always show the best judgment. Recently, Jess invited me over for dinner to meet Mike's parents, who were visiting for the weekend. I figured it was a good opportunity to bond with them and support Jess.

Before dinner, I had a long day at work and was feeling a bit off. When I arrived, I found out Jess had planned a big family dinner with a fancy roast, and everyone was excited. However, as the night went on, I noticed Mike's parents were kind of awkward and didn’t really engage in conversation. It was clear they were trying hard to find common ground, but it wasn’t happening.

Feeling uncomfortable, I started making jokes to lighten the mood and get people laughing. Unfortunately, my jokes were mostly at Mike's expense. I teased him about some of his interests, like his obsession with fantasy football and his inability to cook, while Jess just sat there, looking increasingly mortified. What I thought was harmless ribbing turned into something less fun when Mike seemed genuinely hurt, and his parents started to look uncomfortable too.

After dinner, Jess pulled me aside and told me that my jokes were inappropriate and that I made Mike feel bad in front of his parents. I thought she was overreacting, honestly. I mean, they were just jokes! I didn’t see the harm, and everyone was laughing... except for Mike, of course. I shrugged it off and said I was just trying to keep the conversation going.

We agreed that he could stay for a month or two, and I really thought I was being a good friend.

I also found out that he had been inviting friends over without asking me, and they would stay late, making noise and disturbing my peace. I mentioned my discomfort to him, but he acted like I was overreacting and insisted that it was just a little socializing.

I said I was tired of having my space invaded and that I needed to reclaim my home. He seemed really hurt and accused me of being a bad friend, but I felt justified. I believe I was very generous to let him stay, and he should have been more proactive in finding a job and respecting my space.

You're the Asshole,"I work at a local coffee shop where we have a pretty close-knit team and a lot of regular customers. One of our regulars, let's call him Mike, is a friendly guy in his late 50s who comes in every morning for his coffee. He chats with all of us and is generally well-liked. Over time, I developed a bit of a rapport with him because we both love discussing books and movies.

A few months ago, I had a rough week personally—I had just gone through a breakup and was feeling pretty down. Mike noticed I seemed off one morning and asked if I was okay. I ended up pouring my heart out to him about my situation, and he listened and offered some kind words. It felt good to have someone to talk to, and I appreciated his support.

Fast forward to last week, I was working a shift and Mike came in as usual. He seemed a bit different, though, and after we chatted, he handed me an envelope. He told me it was a little something to lift my spirits. I was surprised but opened it right there in front of him. Inside was a significant amount of cash.

I felt really uncomfortable at first, but then I thought about how much I could use that money. I had just moved into a new apartment and was struggling to pay some bills. I thanked him profusely and accepted it, even though a part of me felt it was inappropriate.

After that, things got a bit weird. Mike started coming in more often, wanting to chat for longer and making it clear he was interested in me beyond just friendship. I knew I should have set boundaries, but I didn’t want to hurt his feelings, especially after he had been so nice to me during my tough times.

Yesterday, he asked me out for dinner, and I froze. I told him I couldn't because of my work schedule, but I could feel that he was disappointed. I ended up texting him later to explain that I just didn’t see him that way and it was probably best if we kept things friendly at the coffee shop. He seemed upset, which made me feel guilty, but I justified it by reminding myself how much I needed that money.

TLDR: I accepted a large sum of cash from a regular customer who was just being nice to me during a tough time, but now it’s created an awkward situation where he wants more than friendship and I feel guilty for not setting boundaries.",826,1594,0.67,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_39269,2020-03-06 00:00:00,YTA,2262,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I recently joined a local book club that had been running for a few years. The club had a strong sense of camaraderie, and it was mostly composed of women. When I joined, I was excited about discussing books with everyone, but I quickly noticed that the group had a very specific dynamic. They often joked around and used inside jokes that made me feel a bit left out.

One day, after a particularly long meeting where I felt ignored, I decided to make a joke to lighten the mood. I said something like, ""Well, this book was about as interesting as watching paint dry, right, ladies?"" I thought it would be funny and relatable, but instead, the room fell silent. A few members looked visibly uncomfortable, and one of them, Sarah, even told me that my comment was inappropriate and disrespectful to the group.

I brushed it off and rolled my eyes, saying that it was just a joke and that they should lighten up. I told them that if they couldn't handle a little humor, they shouldn't be in a book club. I felt like I was just trying to be funny and part of the group. After that, a couple of members started to distance themselves from me, and I overheard them discussing how my comment was sexist.

Now I'm wondering if I was in the wrong for making that joke. I really didn't mean any harm, and I thought humor was welcome in the club.

My girlfriend and I often have movie nights at home, and we usually order pizza. It’s become a bit of a tradition for us.

So last weekend, we had planned a movie night on Friday. I was really looking forward to it after a long week at work. On the day of, I came home after work, tired and hungry, and decided to order a large pizza for us. I specifically went for my favorite toppings, which I know are not the usual ones kids like—things like olives, artichokes, and feta cheese. When we sat down to eat, I noticed that her daughter was a bit apprehensive about the pizza choices, but I shrugged it off, thinking she would get used to it.

As we were watching the movie, I happily started digging into my pizza. After a few slices, I noticed her daughter was just picking at the pizza and didn’t seem to be enjoying it. I jokingly said, “Hey, at least you can try something new!” and kept eating. When she eventually asked if we could order a cheese pizza instead, I laughed it off and said, “No way! This is the best pizza ever!” I thought it was a funny moment, not realizing how it affected her.

After the movie, my girlfriend pulled me aside and said I should have been more considerate of her daughter’s preferences. She said that kids can be picky eaters and that I should have made sure there was something on the pizza her daughter would actually eat. I got defensive and argued that it was just a pizza and that it was a good opportunity for her to try new things. I even went as far as saying that I didn’t want to cater to her daughter’s tastes every time we had pizza.

My parents always pushed me to be the best, and I was constantly compared to my older brother, who was a star athlete and a straight-A student. I always felt like I had to prove myself and live up to their expectations, which made me really anxious.

Fast forward to now: I’m in college, and I’ve decided to pursue a career in art. My parents were really disappointed when I told them because they wanted me to go into something more stable, like medicine or engineering. I’ve been dealing with their disapproval for the past couple of years, and it’s been tough on our relationship.

Recently, my brother got engaged, and the whole family was over the moon. They started planning this huge engagement party, and while I was happy for him, I couldn’t shake the feeling of being overshadowed once again. I decided that I didn’t want to attend the engagement party because I knew all the focus would be on him, and I’d feel like a total afterthought.

Instead of just not going quietly, I posted on social media about how I was taking a stand against the pressure of family expectations and how I wouldn't let my brother's engagement take away from my own journey in art. I made it sound like I was prioritizing my mental health, but deep down, I just didn’t want to deal with feeling inadequate at the party.

My family was furious with me. They felt I was being selfish and sought attention by making my brother’s engagement about myself. They said I should have supported him, regardless of my feelings. I think I was just trying to assert my independence and make a statement about my own life choices, but now I feel guilty about how I handled it.

I also made a remark about how the whole wedding planning process must be boring since they practically have everything handed to them on a silver platter.

She has been engaged for over a year and is finally getting ready to marry her fiancé in a few months. I really like her fiancé, but I think my friend is making a huge mistake with her choice of wedding venue.

She wants to have a small, intimate wedding at a beautiful, rustic barn that’s been in her family for generations. However, I think it’s a terrible idea because the last time I visited, it was quite run-down and had some safety issues. I voiced my concerns to her, saying that I didn’t think it was a safe choice and that she should consider a more upscale venue for her special day.

Instead of just letting her make her own decision, I kept pushing the issue. I started sending her links to other venues I thought were better and even suggested that I would help pay for a nicer place if she decided to change her mind. My friend was clearly upset and told me that she had a vision for her wedding and didn't want to change it. I kept insisting that she was making a mistake and that I just wanted what was best for her.

Eventually, she got really frustrated and said she felt like I was trying to control her wedding planning. I brushed it off and told her that I was just looking out for her. I didn't think I did anything wrong since I was trying to help her avoid a potential disaster.

You're the Asshole,"So, I recently made a decision that I thought was for the best, but now I’m starting to think it might have been a bit selfish. 

I have a younger brother who is 10 years old. He loves playing video games and has been really into this new game that just came out. He plays it a lot, and I used to play with him sometimes. But lately, I’ve been feeling like I need to focus more on my own hobbies and activities. I’m in my last year of college, and I have a lot going on—classes, a part-time job, and trying to prepare for my future career.

I decided that the best way to help myself concentrate was to take away my brother's gaming console. I told my parents that it was too distracting for him and that he should be spending more time on homework and playing outside. They were hesitant but eventually agreed to let me hide the console in my room for a while.

My brother was devastated. He loves that game and has been looking forward to playing it with his friends, and he came to me crying about how unfair it was. I told him he could find other activities he enjoys and that it was for his own good. But honestly, I was mostly thinking about how nice it would be to have my own quiet space without the constant sounds of gaming.

Now he’s really upset with me and doesn’t want to talk to me, while I’ve been trying to brush it off like it’s no big deal. I thought I was doing the right thing for both of us, but now I'm not so sure.

I (30F) have a younger sister, Lily (26F), who just got engaged. I was really excited for her and offered to help plan her wedding. Lily has always wanted a small, intimate ceremony, but after getting engaged, she began to feel pressure from our parents to have a big wedding with all of our extended family invited. I completely understand her dream, but I also think she should stand up for what she wants.

About a month ago, Lily told me that, due to the pressure, she was going to have the big wedding our parents wanted. I was disappointed but tried to be supportive. I even offered to help her with some of the planning, thinking maybe I could help her make it a little more in line with her original vision. However, as the planning progressed, I felt myself getting more frustrated. It felt like my sister was losing sight of what she wanted for herself and was just going along with what everyone else wanted.

Last week, I accidentally overheard her talking to a friend about how stressed she was about the large guest list and how she didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings by cutting people off the list. In a moment of frustration, I confronted her about it. I told her that she was being weak for not standing up for herself and that if she really cared about her wedding, she would put her foot down. I told her she was letting our parents control her life.

She got really upset and said I didn’t understand how hard it was for her to deal with our parents and that it was her wedding, not mine. I felt justified at the moment because I believed I was just being honest about how I felt. But after having some time to think, I realized I may have crossed a line.

I’m now questioning if I was too harsh on her. I told her that she should be more assertive, but maybe I should have been more supportive instead of critical. I haven’t reached out to her since our argument, and I’m wondering if I should apologize or if I’m in the right.

We’ve been together for about two years, and we usually have a pretty good understanding of each other. However, she’s been really stressed out with work lately, and I thought it would be a nice gesture to surprise her with a homemade dinner.

I spent the afternoon cooking her favorite meal and even bought a nice bottle of wine. When she got home, I had everything set up nicely on the table. I was really excited to share it with her, thinking it would lift her spirits. However, when she walked in, she looked exhausted and just wanted to relax. She didn’t seem happy about the dinner; instead, she told me she wasn’t hungry and just wanted to watch some TV and unwind.

Instead of being understanding, I got frustrated. I told her I went through all this effort for her and she could at least pretend to appreciate it. I insisted that she sit down and eat, and I wouldn’t take no for an answer. I kept pushing, even when she said she really didn't want to eat right then. Eventually, she gave in and sat down, but she didn’t enjoy the meal and looked more upset than anything else.

Afterward, she told me that I should have respected her feelings and recognized that she wasn’t in the mood for a big dinner. I feel bad about it now and wonder if I was too harsh.

I’ve always been a bit of a know-it-all and I take pride in my intellect. I graduated from a prestigious university with a degree in engineering and currently work in a high-paying job. My friends often come to me for advice or help with their projects, and I usually enjoy sharing my knowledge. However, I sometimes don't realize how my delivery can come off.

Recently, my friend Sarah, who has a degree in art, started a small business selling handcrafted jewelry. She’s put a lot of effort into it, but her sales have been slow. One evening, we were hanging out, and she expressed her frustration about her business not taking off as she hoped. Without thinking, I started listing off various strategies, marketing techniques, and ways to optimize her social media presence. I was excited to share what I knew, but I could see that my enthusiasm was overwhelming her.

As I kept talking, I noticed she became quieter and more withdrawn. I didn't pick up on her cues until she finally snapped at me, saying I was being condescending and that I should let her figure things out on her own. I felt hurt because I genuinely thought I was helping her and I had no idea I was coming across as patronizing.

After that, the mood shifted, and we ended up having a tense evening. I reached out to her later to apologize, but she said she just needed some time to think and felt like I didn’t respect her as an entrepreneur. I still don’t see what I did wrong; I just wanted to help!

You're the Asshole,"I know this might sound bad, but hear me out.

I’ve been friends with Sarah for about five years, and we have a pretty great friendship, or at least I thought we did. Recently, Sarah has been going through a tough time. She lost her job a few months ago and has been struggling to find a new one. She’s also going through a difficult breakup. I’ve tried to be there for her, but honestly, it’s been exhausting.

I work a demanding job that requires a lot of my time and energy, and when I get home, I just want to relax. Sarah started calling me every day to vent about her problems, and it was taking a toll on me. I tried to be supportive, but sometimes I just didn’t have the emotional bandwidth. I began to dodge her calls and texts, hoping she'd get the hint that I needed some space.

A couple of weeks ago, Sarah reached out to me in a panic because she was feeling really low and mentioned that she was considering self-harm. I felt guilty for not being there more, but at that moment, I just didn’t have the energy to engage. Instead of offering her support or encouraging her to seek help, I texted her back, “You need to toughen up and stop being so dramatic. Everyone goes through tough times, and you can’t just wallow in it forever.”

I thought maybe that would motivate her to pick herself up, but it only made things worse. She stopped talking to me altogether and reached out to other friends for support. A mutual friend confronted me and said I was being insensitive and that I should apologize to Sarah, but I felt justified in my response. I believed I was just being honest and trying to help her snap out of it.

Now, I’m starting to realize that my response might have been too harsh, especially given everything she’s been going through. But I’m also frustrated that I feel like I can’t take care of my own mental health while supporting someone else.

However, I did not realize how messy his sister could be. She often leaves her stuff scattered all over the living room and kitchen, and it drives me insane. 

One day, I came home from work and found dirty dishes piled high in the sink, clothes on the floor, and snack wrappers everywhere. I snapped and told her that if she couldn’t clean up after herself, she wouldn’t be allowed to hang out in the common areas anymore. I said this in front of my partner, and he looked really uncomfortable. 

Later, he tried to tell me that she’s just a teenager, and it’s normal for her to be messy. He suggested that we should talk to her about it kindly instead of issuing threats. But I was so frustrated that I brushed him off and insisted that she needed to learn responsibility. 

I think it’s perfectly reasonable to expect her to keep shared spaces clean, but now my partner is upset with me for how I handled it.

You're the Asshole,"I'm 30 and recently got engaged to my fiancé, who's 32. He has a younger sister, Mia, who is 16 and has always been a bit of a handful. She struggles in school and often gets into trouble for her impulsive behavior, which has led to her parents being really strict with her. I've tried to be supportive of Mia and even helped her with a few school projects, but I can't say that I've particularly enjoyed spending time with her.

A couple of weeks ago, Mia asked if she could come over to our house to help plan my wedding. She has this idea that she wants to be involved in every detail, but the truth is, I see her as a kid and I'm not sure if she’s mature enough to participate in something as important as this. I thought it would be a nice gesture to let her help with the decorations since she has a flair for it, but when I went to pick out some flowers with her, she suggested some really juvenile ideas that I just couldn't take seriously.

I ended up gently telling her that we would go with a more elegant theme and that I appreciated her input, but I wanted to go in a different direction. She seemed disappointed, but I didn’t think much of it. However, she took it really hard and burst into tears, saying that I was being mean and that I was ruining her chance to be part of something special.

After that, I vented to my fiancé about it, and he got upset. He said I should have been more encouraging and understanding, given how much she looks up to me. He even suggested that I was being a bit of a bridezilla by not including her in a way that she felt valued. I felt defensive, but he insisted that I needed to apologize to her.

I finally did, but it felt forced. I told her I was sorry if I hurt her feelings, but I still didn’t change my mind about the theme. Now, Mia is more distant with me, and my fiancé seems frustrated that I'm not trying harder to bond with her. I just feel like I shouldn’t have to sacrifice my wedding vision to make her feel included.

The wedding planning began, and my friend was excitedly telling me all about her vision for the big day. She mentioned wanting a particular theme and color scheme, which I thought was beautiful.

However, I had my own ideas for what I wanted to wear as a bridesmaid. I found this stunning, extravagant dress that I absolutely fell in love with. It was a bold red color that completely clashed with the wedding's pastel theme. I knew my friend had her heart set on a more understated look, but I couldn’t resist the allure of the dress. I told her I wanted to wear it, insisting that it would make me stand out and how important it was for me to express my style. 

My friend was taken aback and expressed her disappointment. She explained that she had a vision for her wedding and that she wanted all her bridesmaids to complement each other and the overall theme. I brushed her concerns off, saying that it was just one day and that I should be allowed to wear what I wanted. I felt like her request was unfair and limiting.

Despite her pleading, I went ahead and ordered the dress. When it arrived, I tried it on and felt amazing. I posted pictures of myself in the dress on social media, which my friend saw and didn’t take well. She confronted me, saying that I was ruining her wedding vibe and that I was being selfish.

I told her it was just a dress and that she should be happy I was excited about being in her wedding.

Afterward, I found out that Sarah was really upset with me for not respecting her decision to not drink. She felt pressured to have a good time and blamed me for her getting sick.

Recently, she invited me to be one of her bridesmaids, and I was thrilled! However, she also mentioned that her wedding is going to have a ""no kids"" policy, which I found a bit surprising. She explained that she wants an elegant and adult atmosphere, and while I understand her reasoning, it made me feel uncomfortable since I have a 2-year-old son.

I told her that I might not be able to attend if I couldn’t bring my son. I thought she would understand since I’m a single mom and finding childcare can be really tough. Instead, she got upset and said that I was being selfish for not prioritizing her big day over my parenting responsibilities. I felt hurt and defensive, so I suggested that maybe she could just make an exception for my son since he’s so young.

That’s when things escalated. I ended up telling her that if she really cared about our friendship, she would reconsider the no kids rule, and I implied that her wedding was more about the spectacle than about the people involved. I know that wasn’t fair, but I was frustrated.

However, when I shared my plan with my family, my aunt suggested that I wait until Sarah had her baby and then announce mine, as Sarah was the first to share her news. I brushed off the idea, thinking it wouldn’t matter since we’d be having our babies just a few months apart.

The weekend of the family gathering came and I decided to reveal my pregnancy after Sarah announced hers. I made sure to time it perfectly, wanting our announcements to be memorable. However, when I did, Sarah’s reaction was not what I expected. She looked visibly upset and even teared up. She later told me that she felt overshadowed and that it was supposed to be her moment.

I felt guilty but justified my actions by thinking it was just a coincidence. We would be having babies close together and I thought it was fun to share this experience. But my family later told me that I had taken away the shine from her big news.

I invited a group of friends, including my friend “J,” who’s very soft-spoken and tends to shy away from loud situations.

Instead of checking in on her, I decided to keep the party vibe going and even encouraged a few friends to turn the music up more. I thought she should just loosen up and enjoy the celebration.

You're the Asshole,"So, I’m a 30-year-old woman and I’ve been dating my boyfriend, Jake, for about two years. We’ve been talking about moving in together, and I had this idea that I would love to have him stay in my apartment rent-free. I’ve worked hard to pay off my student loans early and save up for my own place, and now I own a small one-bedroom. I figured that since I’ve been financially responsible, I could afford to cover the bills and mortgage by myself while he saves up.

I brought up the idea to him, and he seemed excited about it, but then I thought about it more. I started feeling uncomfortable with the idea of just letting him stay without contributing anything. I mean, I have a decent salary, but I also have my own expenses, and I don’t want to feel like I’m just shouldering everything. So, I decided that I would charge him $800 a month to stay with me.

Now, here’s where I might have messed up: I told him that he would be living with me as a tenant, and that he would need to sign a lease. I explained that the rent would help me cover the bills, and that even though it’s less than what he’d pay for a place of his own, I still expected him to contribute because I didn’t want to be his “sugar mama” or anything like that.

Jake was really taken aback by my proposal. He told me that he felt it was unfair to charge him rent when we were supposed to be building a life together. He thought we should be sharing expenses equally, and that he was okay contributing to utilities and groceries, but paying me rent felt transactional. I dismissed his feelings and insisted that this was a fair arrangement.

Now, I feel somewhat lost. I really thought I was being reasonable by asking for rent, but maybe I didn’t consider how it would affect our relationship. A few friends I talked to about this think I’m in the right for wanting to secure my finances, but others think I’m being too rigid and should make it work without money getting in the way.

You're the Asshole,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I have a younger brother, Jake, who is 15. He’s always been a bit of a nerd—more into video games and comic books than sports or hanging out with friends. I’m 20 and pretty social, often out with friends or at parties. Recently, Jake got really excited about a new comic book series that he wanted to share with me. He was practically bouncing off the walls when he told me about it and asked if I wanted to read it too. I brushed him off, jokingly calling him a ""loser"" for caring so much about ""kids' stuff"" and said that I had better things to do than read a comic book.

Well, Jake’s face fell, and I could tell I really hurt his feelings, but I just laughed it off and went back to scrolling through my phone. A couple of days later, I overheard him talking to one of his friends on the phone, and he was super excited about some character developments in the series. I thought it would be funny to walk in and mock him a bit more, so I said something like, “Wow, you’re really just a loser, huh? Get some real hobbies!”

Jake got defensive and said, “At least I’m not wasting my life going to dumb parties like you.” I felt so offended by that; I mean, I’m just trying to enjoy my life, right? So instead of letting it go, I decided to tell my parents that Jake was being disrespectful and that he should be punished for talking to me like that.

My parents ended up grounding him for a week, and I felt pretty proud of myself for teaching him a lesson about respecting older siblings. But now, looking back, I realize I was just being really mean and dismissive of his interests. 

Reasons why I might be TA:
1. I made fun of something he genuinely enjoyed, which I know hurt him.
2. I escalated the situation by involving my parents and getting him punished for standing up for himself.
3. I didn’t consider how my words affected him; I was just trying to be funny.

Reasons why I might not be TA:
1. I thought he was being overly sensitive and needed to toughen up.
2. I’m older and have more life experience, so I felt like I was just guiding him.

When I got there, I saw that my sister had already ordered a cake from a local bakery and was really excited about it. I didn’t think much of it at first, but when I saw her friends complimenting my sister’s cake, I couldn’t help but feel a bit hurt. I thought my cake was delicious and had put a lot of effort into making it special for her.

So, rather than letting it go, I decided to make a comment to her friends about how I thought my cake was better and that it was a shame they weren’t trying it. My sister overheard me and looked really upset. She told me that she appreciated my effort but that she had already made plans for the bakery cake and that I didn’t need to put down her choice. I brushed it off and said it was just a joke, but the mood definitely shifted after that.

The rest of the night was awkward, and I ended up leaving earlier than planned. My sister sent me a text later saying that I should have been more supportive and that it was her birthday, and she didn’t want to feel like she had to choose between our cakes.

Now I’m wondering if I was the asshole for bringing up my feelings about my cake when it clearly upset her. Was I wrong for wanting recognition for my effort on her birthday?",662,2624,0.61,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_48778,2021-11-13 00:00:00,YTA,1601,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I know I messed up, but please hear me out.

About six months ago, I was hanging out with my friends at a party when my buddy Jake started talking about how he was planning a big birthday bash for his girlfriend, Sarah. He was super excited and wanted it to be a surprise. He even said he was planning to invite her whole family and a bunch of their friends. 

Now, here’s where I went wrong. I thought it would be funny to tease Jake a little and playfully suggested that I could ""accidentally"" spill the beans to Sarah. I was joking, but Jake got really anxious and said I shouldn’t do that. I brushed it off, thinking he was overreacting. 

A couple of weeks later, I was hanging out with Sarah, and she seemed really down. I decided to lighten the mood and jokingly told her about Jake’s surprise party plans, thinking she’d laugh it off. Instead, she looked devastated and said she had been looking forward to the surprise. I immediately regretted it and tried to backtrack, but she didn’t want to hear it.

Jake found out soon after, and he was furious. He told me I completely ruined his plans and that I was being a terrible friend. I tried to argue that I was just joking and that it wasn’t a big deal, but he said I should have respected his wishes.

Now, Jake has been avoiding me, and I feel like a jerk. Some friends say I’m not the asshole because I didn’t mean any harm, while others say I’m completely in the wrong for not taking Jake’s feelings seriously.

So, a little background: I’ve been in a committed relationship with my boyfriend for about 18 months. We have a great relationship, or at least I thought we did.

Last month, I went out for drinks with some friends from work. It was a casual outing, and after a few drinks, I started chatting with a guy at the bar. He was really charming, and we quickly hit it off. I didn’t think much of it at first; it was just a fun conversation. We laughed, shared stories, and even exchanged some flirty comments.

As the night went on and the drinks kept coming, I started feeling bolder. We ended up taking a picture together and posting it on social media, tagging each other. I thought it was all in good fun, but my boyfriend saw it and got really upset. He confronted me about it the next day, saying it looked inappropriate and that I should have considered how it would make him feel.

I brushed it off, claiming it was just a harmless night out and that I had no intention of cheating or anything like that. I thought he was overreacting. However, my friends told me I was crossing a line by being flirty with another guy and posting it online. They said I should have respected my relationship more.

You're the Asshole,"Sorry for the long story.

I have a close friend named Jake who is getting married soon. He always dreamed of having a destination wedding in a beautiful location, and he finally made it happen. The problem is that the wedding is scheduled for a Friday, and I have a work commitment that same day. I informed Jake about this as soon as I received the invitation, and he seemed understanding, telling me he hoped I could join for the weekend festivities.

Despite the commitment, I still wanted to be a part of his special day, so I planned to fly in on Saturday morning and join the reception. However, I got caught up with work and ended up missing my flight. I frantically texted Jake to let him know I wouldn't make it to the reception either. I was really upset and felt terrible for not being there.

After a few days, Jake reached out to tell me that he was disappointed I couldn't make it. I responded by saying that if he really valued our friendship, he wouldn't have scheduled his wedding on a day when I had a commitment. I also mentioned how he should have considered the guests who might have conflicts. I felt justified because it was a huge inconvenience for me.

Jake was hurt and told me I was being selfish for putting my work over his wedding. I argued that I didn’t ask him to change his date, and I shouldn’t have to rearrange my life for his plans. I said he should have been more flexible with the timing since it was a destination wedding. 

Now I feel like I might have overreacted, but I still believe he should have thought about his friends when planning his wedding. I’m not sure if I’m the one in the wrong here.",469,2158,0.82,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_23200,2021-08-28 00:00:00,YTA,1642,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I (32F) have a younger brother, Jake (25M), who recently got engaged to his long-time girlfriend, Sarah (24F). Their engagement has brought a lot of excitement, but it has also brought out some of my insecurities. 

Growing up, I was always the ""smart one"" in the family. I excelled academically, went to a great university, and landed a good job. However, I've always struggled with my weight and body image. While my brother has always been fit and active, I’ve never had the same level of motivation. I’ve tried various diets and workouts, but nothing seems to stick for me.

When Jake and Sarah got engaged, I felt a mix of happiness and jealousy. They are both beautiful, and I couldn’t help but feel like I was the ugly duckling of the family. I started to spiral over the thought of how I would look in their wedding photos and felt like I needed to make a change.

A couple of months ago, I decided to reach out to Sarah for advice on losing weight. She’s into fitness and has a solid routine, so I thought she could help me. Instead, she encouraged me to embrace my body and suggested that I should focus on being healthy rather than trying to fit a certain mold. While I appreciated her intentions, I couldn’t shake off my need to lose weight.

So, I took matters into my own hands. I started following a strict diet plan and exercising excessively. I started criticizing Sarah’s food choices during family dinners, pointing out how unhealthy some of the dishes were. I made comments about how I was trying to be more disciplined and encouraged her to join me, even though she was perfectly healthy.

The tipping point came when I suggested to Jake that they should consider a smaller wedding because I was worried about how I would look in the photos. I told him that I didn’t want to be the “fat” sister in all the pictures. He was taken aback and told me that it was their special day, not about how I looked. I brushed it off, feeling like he didn’t understand.

After that conversation, I decided to vent my frustrations on social media. I posted about how hard it is to be the less attractive sibling and how weddings put so much pressure on us. I tagged my brother and Sarah, which didn’t sit well with them. They both reached out to me, saying that my post was hurtful and insensitive.

Now, the family is divided. Some think I’m just being honest about my insecurities, while others believe I crossed a line by dragging them into my issues. I genuinely thought I was just expressing my feelings, but now I’m wondering if I was an asshole for making this about me and my insecurities instead of supporting my brother and his fiancée.

So, AITA for posting my feelings about my weight and insecurities in the context of their wedding?",173,2092,0.75,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_28299,2018-01-01 00:00:00,YTA,2751,AITA
You're the Asshole,"Some background:

I (28M) have a younger sister (25F) who recently got engaged. She’s been with her fiancé for about a year, and they’re currently in the midst of planning their wedding. I’ve always been supportive of her relationships, but I have a bit of a history when it comes to her choices, especially when it comes to her fiancé. I don’t think he’s the right fit for her, but I’ve kept my opinions to myself—until recently.

Main story:

My sister invited me to a small family dinner to celebrate her engagement, and I was looking forward to it. However, I felt strongly that I needed to express my concerns about her fiancé’s character. I had heard some things about him that made me uncomfortable, and I thought it was my responsibility to tell her, especially since she was making such a big life decision.

During the dinner, everything was going well until I decided to bring up my concerns. I didn’t mean to ruin the mood, but I felt that she needed to hear my thoughts. I started talking about some of the things I had heard and how I didn’t think he treated her well in certain situations. I could see her getting upset, but I pressed on, thinking that she would appreciate my honesty.

Instead of a thoughtful discussion, she became really defensive and ended up crying at the table. Our parents were shocked and tried to diffuse the situation, but I was just trying to look out for her, in my mind. I thought I was being a good brother by being honest and protecting her from potential heartbreak.

After that night, my sister hasn’t spoken to me much and has been distant. I feel guilty for ruining her engagement dinner, but I still believe I did the right thing by being honest about my concerns. I’ve tried to reach out and apologize for how I handled it, but I can’t shake the feeling that I was just looking out for her best interests.

She's been posting her work online and getting some decent feedback, which is great for her. However, during dinner, she started talking about her latest painting, and honestly, it was a bit amateurish.

Now, I’m all for supporting her enthusiasm, but I thought it was my duty as an older cousin to give her some constructive criticism. So, when she asked what I thought of it, I said, “Well, I think you should maybe consider taking a class or watching some online tutorials. It might help you improve your skills.” 

I didn’t think it was a big deal, but suddenly, the mood shifted. My aunt, her mom, got really upset and said I was being too harsh and that I should just encourage her instead of criticizing her. I tried to explain that I was just trying to help, but my cousin looked really hurt and didn’t say another word for the rest of the night. 

Later, my aunt pulled me aside and told me that my cousin was really sensitive about her art and that I should have just praised her efforts instead of pointing out flaws. I thought I was just being honest and trying to help her grow as an artist, but now I feel like I messed up.

You're the Asshole,"I love to cook and often prepare large meals on the weekends. I've found that sharing food is a great way to connect with friends and family. A few weeks ago, I hosted a dinner party for a small group of friends. I went all out and made a delicious lasagna, garlic bread, and a fresh salad. Everyone had a great time, and I was really happy that they enjoyed the food I prepared.

During the dinner, one of my friends, Sarah, mentioned that she had been feeling overwhelmed with work and life in general. I felt bad for her and wanted to help out, so I offered to send her home with some leftovers. I packed up a generous portion of the lasagna and some bread for her, thinking she’d appreciate having a homemade meal during her busy week.

The next day, I saw Sarah post a photo of the leftovers on social media, raving about how “amazing” the lasagna was and how much she was enjoying it. I was happy to see her enjoying the food, but then I noticed that her post received a lot of comments from mutual friends asking her to save some for them or if they could come over to try it.

Feeling a bit possessive, I commented on her post, jokingly saying something like, “That was meant for you, not for your fan club!” I thought it was funny at the time, but then Sarah responded by saying that I shouldn’t have given it to her if I wanted it to be a secret treat. She seemed a bit annoyed, and I brushed it off, thinking she was just being overly sensitive.

Later, I reached out to her privately to apologize if my comment came off the wrong way, but I also mentioned that I thought it was a bit ridiculous for her to share food that was meant for her, especially when I went to the effort of cooking it for her specifically. Sarah didn’t respond well to that and said I was being entitled over food I had already given away.

Now I’m starting to wonder if I was in the wrong. I just wanted to make her feel special and didn’t mean to make her feel pressured about sharing the food.",460,2507,0.75,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_50332,2022-06-25 00:00:00,YTA,1982,AITA

In my tipsy state, I thought it would be hilarious to take the mic during the reception and give an impromptu toast.

Instead of saying something heartfelt or supportive, I ended up sharing embarrassing stories about my cousin and her husband—things I thought were funny at the time, but looking back, they were pretty cringeworthy. I made jokes about their first date and even brought up a few awkward moments from their relationship that should have stayed private.

Some guests were laughing, but I could see my cousin's face getting red, and her husband looked uncomfortable. After I was done, it turned into an awkward silence, and my cousin eventually had to politely change the subject. I thought it was all in good fun, but later on, I overheard some relatives talking about how inappropriate my comments were.

I reached out to my cousin a few days later to apologize, but she said she was still upset and that it wasn't the time or place for that kind of humor. I feel like I was just trying to lighten the mood, so I don’t think I was that wrong, but now I’m wondering if I crossed a line.

I live in a shared apartment with three other roommates, and one of them, Sarah, has a habit of leaving her dirty dishes in the sink for days.

Sarah was understandably upset when she found her dishes on her bed. She confronted me about it, saying I crossed a line and made her feel disrespected in her own home.

I didn’t own anything that fit the theme, so I decided to go out and buy a new outfit. I found a beautiful vintage dress that I loved and thought was perfect for the occasion. The only problem was that it was a bit on the pricey side, but I figured it was worth it for a wedding.

When I showed up on the wedding day, I was excited to see Sarah and celebrate with her. However, when she saw my dress, her face dropped.

I was taken aback because I thought I looked nice, and I put a lot of effort into finding something appropriate.

Feeling embarrassed and frustrated, I snapped back and told her that it was her fault for not being more specific about the dress code.

Background of the issue: My girlfriend recently planned a weekend trip with her friends to a beach house. I was initially supportive and encouraged her to go because I knew how much she needed a break. However, I felt a bit left out since I wasn’t invited, but I tried not to show it.

The problem: A few days before the trip, she mentioned that they would be going to a bar one night while there.

I ended up texting her with passive-aggressive comments about how I hoped she’d be safe and that I didn’t trust her friends. I even brought up how one of her friends had a reputation for being a bad influence, which I know was unfair.

I told her that I was disappointed that she wasn’t considering my feelings, and I even said that if she really cared about me, she wouldn’t be out partying without me.

I was really excited because we’ve been friends since college, and I wanted to support her during this special time. However, I also saw it as an opportunity to showcase my own baking skills, so I decided to make a beautiful three-tiered cake as a gift for her.

In the weeks leading up to the shower, my friend mentioned that she wanted everything to be very relaxed and informal. She was expecting it to be a cozy gathering with just a few close friends and family. I interpreted this to mean that I could go all out with my cake, so I spent hours fine-tuning the recipe and decorating it with intricate designs. I even added edible flowers, which took a lot of time and effort.

On the day of the shower, I arrived with the cake, which was quite large and extravagant compared to the rest of the decorations and the simple food spread she had planned. When I walked in, I noticed that most of the food was finger foods, and the atmosphere was indeed casual and laid-back. My cake, while beautiful, felt out of place. 

As guests started to arrive, I noticed that my friend looked increasingly uncomfortable. She had only planned for a small dessert table with cupcakes and cookies, and my cake overshadowed all of that. During the shower, as we were eating and chatting, she awkwardly tried to fit the cake into the casual vibe by joking about how it was a ""wedding cake"" instead of a baby shower cake.

She felt that my cake kind of stole the show and added unnecessary pressure on her for the rest of the day. I thought she was being overly sensitive since everyone loved the cake, but I could see that it really made her feel anxious about everything being too formal.

I even told her that I might have to scale back on the party if I couldn’t get her support.

At this point, she looked really hurt and said that she thought an engagement party was supposed to be a joyful occasion and not something that would cause stress or financial burden. I felt like she was being a bit dramatic, but I was adamant that if I was going to put in the effort and money, she should be a part of it.

Long story short, I ended up going ahead with the party plans, but I didn’t invite her. I told her it was just going to be a small gathering with friends. Now, I feel kind of guilty, but I also think she should have been more appreciative of everything I was doing. Am I the asshole for asking her to contribute financially and then not inviting her when she couldn't?",312,1151,0.54,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_13580,2018-12-28 00:00:00,YTA,1695,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I recently attended a family gathering for my cousin’s birthday. It was a big deal since she was turning 18, and the entire family was there to celebrate. During the party, my aunt, who is a single mom, brought her two kids along. The kids were around 5 and 7 and were excited to be there. 

As the party was going on, the kids started to get a bit rowdy and noisy. I was trying to enjoy my food and conversation with other adults, but the noise was getting on my nerves. I snapped and told my aunt that she really needs to control her kids better because it was ruining the vibe of the party. I made a comment about how it’s embarrassing for her to let them act like that in front of the whole family.

My aunt looked hurt and said she was doing her best, but they were just kids having fun. I could see some family members looking uncomfortable with what I said, but I didn’t back down. I felt justified in my frustration because I just wanted a peaceful gathering without all the chaos.

Later on, my aunt confronted me and said I was being rude and that I should have been more understanding. I brushed it off and told her that if she can’t handle her kids, maybe she shouldn’t bring them to family events. Now I feel a bit guilty, but I still think I was in the right for wanting a quieter environment.",28,778,0.54,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_82351,2024-04-22 00:00:00,YTA,1307,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I recently went on a weekend camping trip with a few friends from work. It was supposed to be a fun getaway to bond and relax. On the second night, after a day of hiking and hanging out by the fire, we decided to play some drinking games. As the night went on, the drinks kept flowing, and the mood got a bit wild.

At one point, someone suggested we have a midnight swim in the nearby lake. I thought it sounded like a blast, so I jumped in without really considering the consequences. A few of my female friends and I decided to go skinny dipping. I figured it would be a harmless, fun experience, and I didn’t think it was a big deal since we were all friends. I didn’t really think about how it might make my boyfriend feel, who wasn’t on the trip.

The next day, I got a text from my boyfriend asking how the trip was going. I casually mentioned the skinny dipping, thinking he would find it funny or at least cool. Instead, he was furious. He felt disrespected and said I should have considered how he would feel about me being naked with other guys. I tried to explain that it was all in good fun and that none of the guys were interested in us like that, but he wasn’t having it.

I know I should have been more mindful of his feelings. I told him he was overreacting and that he needed to lighten up. I even made a joke about it, saying it was just a body, but now I realize that was insensitive. He’s been distant ever since and I feel like I might have ruined things between us.

So, AITA for going skinny dipping with friends and not considering how it would affect my boyfriend? I just wanted to have fun and enjoy the trip, but I know I crossed a line.",1,967,0.66,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_91822,2023-02-13 00:00:00,YTA,1666,AITA

I started planning everything a month in advance, including the food, drinks, and decorations. I have a good friend, Mike (29M), who is also a bit of a party planner, and I asked him for advice on how to make it memorable. We spent a few afternoons brainstorming ideas together.

As I was getting closer to the party date, I realized my budget was a bit tight, and I wanted to keep the costs down. I thought it would be fun to have a potluck-style party where everyone would bring a dish or a drink to share. I didn't think it would be a big deal and sent out invitations with the updated plan, encouraging everyone to bring something.

When I told Mike about it, he seemed really upset. He said he had already planned to cater the food for my party as a gift to me and thought it was really inconsiderate of me to change the plan without consulting him first. I brushed him off, saying I appreciated the offer, but that a potluck would be more fun and less expensive for everyone involved.

The day of the party came, and I had a great time with everyone. But I noticed Mike was acting distant and didn't really join in the fun. I later found out that he felt hurt and unappreciated because he had put a lot of thought into the catering plan and felt like I dismissed his generosity.

Now, I'm starting to realize that maybe I should have taken his feelings into account before deciding on the potluck. I thought I was making the party more inclusive, but I didn’t think about how it affected my friend who wanted to do something nice for me. I feel bad about how things turned out, but I still don’t think I did anything wrong.

A few days before the trip, I decided to invite my younger sister, who’s 18 and has been feeling a bit down lately. I thought it would be a nice way to cheer her up and spend some quality time together. I didn’t think my partner would mind since we had an extra bed in the Airbnb.

When I told my partner about my plan, he seemed really annoyed. He said that he wanted to spend some time alone with me and that bringing my sister would change the dynamic of the trip. I brushed it off, thinking he was overreacting. After all, I thought it would be fun to have her there.

The day of the trip, my sister arrived just as we were packing the car. I announced to everyone that she was coming along. My partner shot me a look, but I was too excited to care. 

On the drive, I tried to include my sister in the conversations, but my partner was visibly upset. He didn’t talk much and seemed distant. When we got to the Airbnb, he didn’t help unpack and just sat on the couch scrolling through his phone.

Later that evening, I noticed he was increasingly annoyed by my sister’s presence. When she asked if she could join us for dinner, he snapped and said, “This was supposed to be a couple’s getaway, not a family reunion.” I felt embarrassed and frustrated. I told him he was being rude and that I had every right to invite my sister.

Things escalated after dinner when my sister wanted to play a board game. My partner flat-out refused, saying he just wanted to relax and not deal with a teenager. I ended up getting into a fight with him because I thought he was being selfish and not considering my feelings.

Recently, my parents caught my younger sisters trying to create secret social media accounts. They got into some trouble, and my parents grounded them for a month. I felt bad for them, but I also thought they needed to learn a lesson about following the rules. However, I couldn't help but be curious about what they were getting into online, so I decided to check their phones while they were at school. 

While I was snooping, I found some messages between my sisters and an older guy who was trying to get them to send him pictures and meet up. It made me furious, and I felt like I needed to do something about it. Instead of talking to them or telling my parents about the messages right away, I took a screenshot of the conversations and posted them on my social media with a caption calling them out for being naive and reckless. I thought maybe it would embarrass them enough to stop talking to this guy and keep them safe. 

When my sisters found out, they were devastated and humiliated. They confronted me, crying and saying I betrayed their trust. I tried to explain that I did it to protect them, but they said I only made things worse. Now my parents are mad at me for exposing them instead of helping them learn privately.

My best friend, Sarah (25), recently got engaged to her long-term boyfriend. They were both really excited and had been planning a big wedding for next summer. I've been supportive, helping with ideas and planning. But about a week ago, Sarah told me she had a dream wedding venue in mind—a beautiful place that’s really expensive and hard to book. I looked it up and saw why; it’s a popular spot and books up fast. 

I thought it was a little unrealistic considering their budget and recommended a few more affordable venues that I thought would fit their style just as well. Sarah seemed really disappointed and said she had her heart set on the dream venue. I tried to encourage her to be practical about it, but she insisted it was her wedding and she wanted what she wanted.

Fast forward to last night, Sarah threw a small engagement party and invited a bunch of friends and family. During the party, I jokingly mentioned that I hoped they’d be able to book that expensive venue before someone else did, and it kind of turned into an awkward moment. Some guests laughed, but Sarah looked really upset, and after the party, she pulled me aside and said I was being unsupportive and that I shouldn’t have brought it up in front of everyone. I told her I was just trying to keep things realistic and that I thought it was better to be honest than to let her get her hopes up.

So, I've been dating my girlfriend for about two years now, and we live together. We're in a pretty good relationship, but I have this habit that I didn’t realize was a big deal until recently.

My girlfriend has been really supportive and has tried to get me to balance my gaming with household chores and spending time together. But honestly, I just get so caught up in my games that I forget about everything else. Last week, she asked me to help her with some cleaning and I just brushed her off, saying I was in the middle of a raid and couldn't pause.

I got defensive and told her she was overreacting and that it was just a hobby. I ended up snapping at her and saying she should be more understanding about my interests.

I (28F) recently got engaged to my boyfriend (30M) after five amazing years together. We’re both over the moon and excited to plan our wedding. My fiancé has a close-knit family, and they’re all really supportive, which I appreciate. However, there’s one issue that’s been causing tension.

My fiancé has a younger sister, Emily (24F), who has always been a bit of a drama queen. She’s very protective of the attention she gets from the family, particularly when it comes to big life events. This isn’t really new; she always seems to want to be the center of attention, and it has annoyed me for quite some time. 

When we announced our engagement, I was thrilled to share the news, but Emily acted really weird. She seemed upset and brought up that she was thinking of getting engaged soon too. I thought it was strange, but I tried to be supportive. However, she then suggested that we should coordinate our engagement announcements and wedding dates so that neither of us steals the spotlight. I laughed it off at first, but she kept insisting that we need to share the attention.

I got frustrated and told her that it’s not my fault if she hasn’t made a commitment yet. I said she should focus on finding the right person instead of worrying about sharing the spotlight with me. I may have come off a bit harsh and dismissive, but I just felt like she was being unreasonable. After that, she went to our parents and told them I was being insensitive, and now there’s a rift in the family.

As the self-appointed planner, I took it upon myself to make the event perfect. I wanted everything to be exactly how I envisioned it. I got super invested in the details and spent a lot of time and money organizing everything. However, in the process, I didn’t really communicate with Lisa about her preferences at all. I assumed I knew what she would want because I’ve been friends with her for so long.

She mentioned that she was hoping for a more laid-back, intimate affair with just her closest friends and family. I brushed it off, thinking she was just being modest and that she’d come to appreciate the effort I put in.

As the date approached, I became more and more defensive about my plans. When Lisa tried to suggest simplifying things or scaling back, I snapped and said she was being ungrateful. I told her that I had spent a lot of time and money to make this special for her, and she should be thankful. I even hinted that if she didn’t like what I was doing, she could plan her own shower next time.

I considered it for a moment but ultimately decided not to help her out because I felt uncomfortable lending money that I might not get back.

You're the Asshole,"My best friend and I have been close for years, and I’ve always been there for her through thick and thin. Recently, she went through a tough breakup, and I really wanted to support her. So, I decided to throw her a surprise ""single again"" party to lift her spirits. I spent a lot of time planning it, getting decorations, food, and inviting a bunch of our mutual friends.

The day of the party, I was so excited and couldn’t wait to see her reaction. When she arrived, I shouted “Surprise!” and everyone cheered. But instead of being happy, she looked really upset. After a moment, she told me that she wasn’t ready to celebrate being single and felt overwhelmed by the whole thing. She explained that she needed time to process her breakup and didn’t want a party thrown in her honor.

I felt really hurt by her reaction. I thought I was doing something nice, and it seemed ungrateful for her to be upset when I went through all this trouble for her. I told her that she was being dramatic and that I was just trying to help her feel better. We ended up arguing, and she left the party early, which made me feel even worse.

Now I’m second-guessing everything. Was I wrong for trying to do something nice for her? AITA for throwing her a party when she clearly didn’t want one?",668,1088,0.73,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_75608,2021-02-02 00:00:00,YTA,1279,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I'm in my late 20s (f) and have a pretty close-knit group of friends. We've been friends since high school, and while we’ve all taken different paths in life, we always find time to catch up. Recently, we decided to throw a surprise birthday party for one of our friends, Lucy, who just turned 30. We set it all up at a local venue and invited everyone from our group, plus some of her family.

Lucy has always been a bit of an introvert, and we wanted to make her feel special, so we planned a lot of surprises. We had decorations, games, and even a video montage of her favorite memories with her friends and family. Everything seemed perfect, and I was really excited.

However, I had this idea that I thought would make the party extra special. I decided to write a speech about Lucy, talking about how much she means to us and sharing some personal anecdotes. I thought it would be heartfelt and appreciated, but I didn’t discuss it with anyone beforehand. 

When the time came for the speeches, I confidently took the mic and started talking. I shared funny moments, sweet memories, and how I admired her for her dedication to her career and her kindness. But then I went off-script and began to mention some of Lucy’s past struggles with anxiety and depression. I thought it would show how far she’s come, but it quickly turned awkward. Some guests shifted in their seats, and I could see Lucy’s face fall. 

Instead of making her feel celebrated, I felt that I had opened up a wound. I could see she was uncomfortable, and when I finally finished, she politely thanked me but didn’t seem happy about it. 

After the party, Lucy texted me, saying she appreciated my intentions but felt that I should have focused on the positive moments rather than bringing up her struggles, especially in front of everyone. I argued back, saying she should be able to celebrate her journey and that I was just being honest. 

Our friends are split on this; some say I was trying to do something nice, while others believe I crossed a line. Now I feel guilty because Lucy has been distant with me since, and I’m starting to think I might have gone too far. AITA?",144,1489,0.63,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_98942,2018-12-20 00:00:00,YTA,2153,AITA
You're the Asshole,"A few days ago, I was at a local coffee shop that I frequent. I always order the same thing – a large cappuccino and a blueberry muffin. While I was waiting for my order, I noticed a new barista behind the counter. She was a young woman who seemed to be struggling a bit with the espresso machine.

When it was my turn to order, I noticed that she was the one making my drink. I asked her if there was someone else who could make it instead, explaining that I prefer my cappuccino to be made by someone with more experience. I pointed out that I had been coming here for a long time and had always had great drinks made by the more experienced baristas.

She looked taken aback and said she was trained to make the drinks too, but I just shrugged it off and insisted on waiting for someone else to make it. Eventually, one of the other baristas stepped in and made my drink. When they handed it to me, I could tell it was made just the way I like it.

When I sat down to enjoy my coffee, I overheard the new barista telling her colleague how I mentioned her lack of experience. I felt a bit guilty, but I justified my behavior by thinking that I was just trying to ensure I got a good drink.

During the project, one of my colleagues, Sarah, came up with an innovative idea that significantly improved our final presentation. I was really impressed and told her that I would make sure to give her credit during the presentation to upper management.

When the day of the presentation came, I was feeling a lot of pressure to impress the bosses and get noticed for my leadership. In the moment, I completely forgot to mention Sarah's contribution and instead presented the project as if it were all my own idea. I know it was wrong, but I thought that by taking all the credit, it might help my chances for promotion.

After the presentation, Sarah approached me and was really upset that I didn't credit her. I brushed her off, saying that in the corporate world, you have to look out for yourself and that she should toughen up. I told her that if she wanted recognition, she should have been more assertive about it.

A few days later, our manager praised my work in a team meeting but also noted that it was too bad that Sarah's contributions went unrecognized. I felt a pang of guilt at that moment, but I still didn’t apologize to Sarah. Instead, I justified my actions by thinking that it was just business.

You're the Asshole,"My brother (Mark) and I have always had a competitive relationship, especially when it comes to sports. Growing up, he was the star athlete and I was more of the artsy type. We’ve managed to keep it friendly for the most part, but it does sometimes lead to tension, especially during family gatherings.

This past weekend, our family had a reunion, and my parents asked me to take photos of everyone to document the day. I thought it would be a great opportunity to capture some fun moments, so I took my time making sure everyone looked good in the pictures. Mark, however, was busy showing off his new golf swing to the other relatives, trying to impress everyone with his skills. 

Later in the day, we were all sitting around sharing stories and laughing when I thought it would be funny to show the pictures I took. I was excited to share some candid shots, but I also had a few that captured Mark in some awkward poses while he was swinging his golf club. In my mind, it was all in good fun, but when I started to share those specific photos, Mark got visibly annoyed and told me to cut it out.

Instead of stopping, I thought it would be hilarious to keep going and pointed out how he looked like he was about to fall over. I laughed it off and even encouraged others to join in. It was all light-hearted, and I figured he’d laugh it off too, just as I would if the roles were reversed. However, he didn’t see it that way. He ended up storming off after telling me I was ruining the day.

The next day, I got a text from our mom saying I took it too far and I should apologize to Mark. I really didn’t think it was that big of a deal; I just wanted to have a good time and make everyone laugh. Now I’m feeling conflicted because I don’t want to be the bad guy in the family, but I also think Mark is being overly sensitive.

She’s been engaged for a few months, and she wants to have a small, intimate wedding with just family and close friends. I think that’s great, but here’s where I might have crossed a line.

My sister has always been someone who dreams big. She talks about lavish weddings and beautiful venues, and she often compares herself to some of her friends who have had over-the-top celebrations. When she told me she was planning a small wedding, I was honestly a bit disappointed. I thought she was just settling because she didn't think she could afford what she really wanted.

So, during our conversation, I kind of blurted out that I think she should just go all out and have the wedding she truly wants. I suggested she should save up for a year or take out a loan to make it happen. I even offered to help her plan it, which I thought would be a nice gesture. She looked really upset and told me that I was being unsupportive and that it was her wedding, not mine. I brushed it off and said she’d thank me later when she had the wedding of her dreams.

Now, she’s really angry with me and hasn’t spoken to me in a few days. I’ve been thinking about it, and maybe I did push her too hard. I just wanted her to have the best day ever, but I feel like I might have been a bit overbearing and dismissive of her wishes.

I noticed Sarah wasn’t eating much. When I asked if she liked the food, she told me that she didn’t eat chicken and was actually vegan, which I completely forgot about.

He dropped out of college after a year because he couldn't handle the stress and has since bounced around from one low-paying job to another. He’s been living with our parents for a while now and relies on them for financial support. They help him with rent, groceries, and even pay for his car insurance since he can’t afford it.

Recently, he came to me to ask for help getting a new job. He had applied to a few places but didn't get any callbacks. I offered to help him practice for interviews and even looked over his resume. However, when I suggested he consider taking a more stable job, he got defensive. He wants to pursue his dream of being a musician, which I get, but he’s not realistic about it. He has no savings, no backup plan, and he spends most of his time playing gigs at small local bars for tips.

When I confronted him about his lack of motivation to find a full-time job, he said I was being unsupportive of his dreams. I told him that he needs to grow up and start acting like an adult. I firmly believe that he should get a steady job to support himself first and pursue music on the side. I might have said something like, ""You can’t just chase your dreams when you’re not in a position to support yourself.""

However, Jake has a bit of a reputation. He’s known for being a player and has had several relationships before Sarah, but he seems to have settled down with her. 

A few months ago, I found out from another friend that Jake had been texting one of his exes behind Sarah’s back. When I confronted him about it, he brushed it off and said it was no big deal. I didn’t want to hurt Sarah, but I felt I had to tell her the truth.

So, I took it upon myself to message Sarah and let her know what was going on. I didn’t have solid proof, just hearsay, but I wanted her to be cautious. When I told her, she was devastated and confronted Jake. He denied everything, and now Sarah is torn between believing him or me.

Looking back, I realize I might have overstepped. Sarah was happy, and maybe it wasn’t my place to interfere. Jake might not be the best guy, but they were in a good place, and I could have just let her figure things out on her own.

Now, Sarah is upset with both me and Jake, and I can’t help but feel responsible for ruining her relationship. Was I wrong to tell her about what I heard?",204,1787,0.83,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_16163,2018-05-03 00:00:00,YTA,1244,AITA

However, I quickly noticed that my coworkers were extremely friendly and quite involved in each other's personal lives. They often share updates on their families, vacations, and even their kids’ achievements during meetings. At first, I tried to engage, but I’m just not comfortable with that level of sharing, especially since I’m more private and introverted.

Last week, they planned a team outing to celebrate a project completion and invited everyone to bring their families. I don’t have a family to bring, and when I mentioned that I wouldn't be attending because I felt out of place, they kept insisting I come. They said it would be a great chance to bond and that they would love to have me there. I snapped and told them that I didn't want to be part of their ""family affair"" and that they should keep their outings to themselves if they only wanted to talk about their kids and spouses.

Some of them seemed hurt by my reaction, but I thought they were being too pushy. I just want to work and not get caught up in personal stuff. Was I wrong for telling them off?",930,1029,0.6,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_78435,2023-06-15 00:00:00,YTA,1169,AITA
You're the Asshole,"So here’s my story: I’ve always been a big fan of a popular video game franchise that has a strong fanbase. Recently, I decided to get a tattoo of one of the main characters because they have inspired me during some tough times in my life. I thought it would be a cool way to show my love for the game and its impact on me.

Last week, I went to a gaming convention wearing a t-shirt of the game and showing off my new tattoo. I was super excited, and I thought it would be a great way to connect with other fans. However, while I was chatting with a group of people about the game, one guy suddenly got really upset and accused me of being a ""fake fan."" He said that unless I had invested a certain amount of time playing the game or knew all the lore by heart, I had no right to get a tattoo of its character.

I was taken aback and tried to explain that the tattoo was personal to me and my journey, but he just kept berating me and said I was disrespecting the game and its community. I ended up feeling embarrassed and left the conversation.

Now, I’m starting to think maybe I overstepped by getting the tattoo without being a hardcore “true fan” like him. Was I wrong to get a tattoo of a character I love, or is he just gatekeeping?",475,2742,0.75,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_56342,2023-11-09 00:00:00,YTA,1240,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I’ve been married to my wife for five years, and we have two kids, ages 3 and 5. Recently, my wife decided to take up a new hobby: pottery. She’s been going to classes twice a week, and it’s something she really enjoys. I’m happy for her, but it means I’ve had to take on more responsibilities at home.

Here's where the issue comes in. I work a demanding job that requires long hours, and I’m often exhausted by the time I get home. I feel like I deserve some time for myself too, so I started going to a local bar with my friends on the nights when my wife has her pottery classes. It's a place where we can unwind, play some pool, and catch up. I usually get home pretty late, and my wife has mentioned that it’s hard for her to manage the kids alone on those nights.

The other day, my wife asked me if I could skip going out with my friends just once so I could help her out after her class. She had a rough day and was feeling overwhelmed. I flat-out refused, saying I needed my time away from the kids and that she chose to take the pottery classes knowing it would mean I’d be home later. I told her it wasn't fair for her to expect me to sacrifice my plans just because she was having a tough time.

Now, she’s upset with me and says I’m being selfish. I think I’m entitled to my own time and space. After all, I’m working hard and should be able to enjoy my life too, right?

The other day, we sat down to talk about what a shared space would look like. I mentioned that I have a lot of video game consoles, collectibles, and decor that I’ve accumulated over the years. I love my gaming setup and it's important to me to have my space reflect my interests.

When I showed her my ideas for how we could set up the living room, she seemed hesitant. She told me that she envisions a more minimalist and cozy atmosphere, with fewer distractions. She also expressed concern that my gaming stuff might not match her aesthetic and that it could make the space feel cluttered.

Instead of considering her feelings, I got defensive and argued that my stuff is just as important as her vision for the apartment. I told her she should just accept me for who I am and that it wouldn’t be fair to ask me to hide away my interests. I said something like, “If you can’t handle my gaming stuff, maybe this isn’t going to work.” 

She looked really hurt and said she just wanted to create a space we both love. I brushed it off and insisted that my gaming setup was going to stay as it is. After that, she went quiet and I could tell I upset her, but I felt justified in wanting to keep my things.

My friends told me I was being an ass for not being more considerate of her feelings and for not trying to find a compromise. I think I was just standing up for myself and my interests, but now I’m starting to wonder if I overreacted.

I (22F) live in a small apartment complex where the walls are pretty thin. I have a neighbor (24M) who is generally nice, but he has a tendency to throw loud parties, especially on weekends. I've mentioned it to him a couple of times before, but he always brushes it off, saying it's just a good time.

Last Saturday, he threw another one of these parties, and it started around 8 PM. I tried to be patient because I wanted to enjoy my evening too, but by midnight, the noise was unbearable. I could hear the music clearly and people yelling and laughing, and I was just trying to relax after a long week at work. 

I decided to give it a chance and hoped it would die down, but it just kept getting louder. Finally, I lost my cool and went over to his apartment. I knocked on the door, and when he answered, I straight-up yelled at him, telling him that he was being inconsiderate and that I couldn’t take it anymore. I told him he needed to keep it down, or I’d call the police.

He looked taken aback and tried to defend himself by saying it was just a party and that people were having fun. I told him that his fun was ruining my night and that I was sick of it. I ended up leaving his apartment feeling pretty justified, but I could tell I hurt his feelings.

The next day, I found out through a mutual friend that he was really upset about the confrontation. He thought I was overreacting and mentioned that he usually tries to keep things down, but sometimes it just gets a bit loud. 

Now I'm feeling bad because maybe I could have handled it better instead of yelling. But at the same time, I was just so frustrated. AITA for confronting him like that?",21,2091,0.52,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_25360,2021-08-20 00:00:00,YTA,1730,AITA

Recently, Jake made the varsity soccer team at his high school, and he was ecstatic. I was happy for him, but I also felt a little left out since we had always done things together when we were younger. I noticed that my parents were putting a lot of emphasis on his achievements, attending every game, and posting about them on social media, which made me feel like I was in the background.

To cope with my feelings, I started making passive-aggressive comments about how being good at sports isn’t everything and that there are other important things in life, like creativity and the arts. I even went so far as to make jokes about how Jake would probably end up as a benchwarmer when he gets to college and that he shouldn’t get too cocky about his high school team.

Recently, our parents decided to throw a mini-celebration for Jake’s soccer achievements, inviting family and friends. I felt completely overshadowed and started to complain to my friends about how unfair it was that all the attention was on him. During the celebration, I made a snarky comment about how “being good at kicking a ball around doesn’t really matter in the grand scheme of things,” and a few people laughed awkwardly, but I could see Jake’s face fall.

Afterward, my parents confronted me about my behavior and said that I should have been more supportive of Jake. They told me that my comments hurt him and that I was being selfish. I argued that I was just trying to express how I felt, but I can’t shake the feeling that maybe I went too far.

We were having a great time, laughing and enjoying some drinks when I had the bright idea to play a little party game I saw online. It was one of those ""truth or dare"" games, and I thought it would be a fun way to lighten the mood even more.

As the game progressed, things got a little out of hand. I dared my friend Mike, who has a bit of a wild side, to dance on the table. He reluctantly agreed, and everyone cheered him on. Feeling bold, I decided to up the ante and dared him to take off his shirt while dancing. He laughed and did it, and we all thought it was hilarious.

Then, I thought it would be even funnier to dare him to take his pants off too since he was already getting a lot of attention. I honestly didn't think he would do it, but to my surprise, he did! At first, everyone was laughing and having a good time, but then I realized that his girlfriend, Sarah, was not amused. She looked completely mortified and embarrassed, and I could see that she was upset.

After Mike got dressed, Sarah confronted me, saying I crossed a line and that it was disrespectful to put him in that position, especially since it was a gathering of friends and not a wild party. I tried to downplay it and told her it was all in good fun, that everyone was just joking around, and that Mike was a good sport about it.

The atmosphere shifted, and I could feel the tension. A couple of my friends sided with Sarah, saying I should have known better than to push Mike like that. I got defensive and told them they were being too serious and needed to lighten up. I still think it was just a harmless prank and I don’t see why I should apologize.

My boyfriend’s best friend, let’s call him Jake, is really close to my boyfriend, but I can’t stand him. He’s rude, obnoxious, and often makes inappropriate jokes that make me uncomfortable. I’ve brought up my feelings to my boyfriend a few times, but he insists that Jake is just joking and that I’m being too sensitive. 

A couple of weeks ago, we all went out for dinner, and Jake was particularly over the top that night. He kept making comments about how my boyfriend should stop wasting his time with me and settle down with someone “more fun.” I was clearly annoyed, and after a few too many drinks, I snapped and told Jake that he needed to grow up and stop being such a loser. My boyfriend was shocked and ended up getting into an argument with me about how I shouldn’t have disrespected his friend like that.

After that night, I told my boyfriend that I didn’t want to hang out with Jake anymore, and he got really upset. He said that he values his friendship with Jake and doesn’t want to lose that over a girl who can't take a joke. I felt really hurt because I thought my boyfriend would support me, but instead, he made me feel like I was the problem.

I ended up telling him that if he continues to prioritize his friend over our relationship, then maybe we should reconsider things. Ever since then, there’s been a lot of tension between us.

I asked what they were, and he explained that he had written a detailed analysis of the film's themes, characters, and cinematography and wanted to discuss it while watching. I wasn’t thrilled about that but went along with it since it was his home.

As the movie started, Sam constantly paused it to share his thoughts, ask questions, and refer to his notes. I tried to let him know gently that I wanted to watch the movie without interruptions, but he brushed me off, saying that I just didn’t appreciate the art of cinema the way he did. I ended up feeling frustrated and told him that it was impossible to enjoy the movie with him constantly stopping it and rambling on.

Things escalated when I finally lost my patience and snapped at him to just shut up and let me watch the movie. Sam looked hurt, and after that, we both sat in silence until the movie ended. I felt bad for losing my cool, but I really wanted to enjoy the film without interruptions.

My younger sister, Lily, is 25 and has been in a relationship with her girlfriend, Mia, for about two years now. While I've accepted their relationship, I'm not exactly the most supportive brother. I don't have anything against LGBTQ+ people, but I simply don't get the whole thing, and I tend to make my opinions known.

When I arrived, I saw that there were rainbow decorations everywhere and a cake that said ""Happy Anniversary, Lovebirds!"" I rolled my eyes a bit but tried to keep my mouth shut.

As the evening went on, everyone was sharing stories and expressing their love for each other. When it was my turn to say something, I felt like I had to be honest. I stood up and said, “I just don’t get the whole gay thing, honestly. I mean, why do you need a celebration for it? Love is love, right? Why can’t you just be happy without all this fuss?”

The room went silent, and I could see Lily's face drop. She looked hurt, and Mia’s expression turned to anger. I tried to explain that I was just being honest and that I didn’t mean to offend anyone, but it felt like I had completely ruined the night.

After that, Lily confronted me later and said that my words were hurtful and dismissive of her relationship.

You're the Asshole,"I'm a high school senior, and I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about a year. We have a pretty solid relationship, but I sometimes feel like she can be a bit clingy. Recently, she has been really excited about prom and wanted to plan everything together, but I just wanted to have a chill time without all the stress.

One day, while we were talking about prom, I jokingly mentioned that I might go with someone else just to see how she would react. I laughed it off, thinking it was harmless, but she got really upset and started to cry. I thought she was overreacting, so I didn't apologize right away. Instead, I told her to lighten up and that it was just a joke.

Later, she told me that she felt insecure about our relationship because of my comment. I brushed it off, saying I was just trying to have fun. Now she's distant, and I feel like I might have ruined the fun of prom for both of us.

You're the Asshole,"Dear Reddit,

I need some perspective on a situation I’ve found myself in with my sister. I (28M) have a close relationship with my sister (25F), and we often hang out together. Recently, she got really into painting and decided to set up a small studio in her apartment. I thought it was a great idea and wanted to support her creativity.

A few weeks ago, I asked her if she wanted to collaborate on a mural for her studio. I love painting, too, and thought it would be a fun project for us to work on together. She was excited about the idea, and we planned a weekend to start.

However, as we began working on the mural, I noticed that my sister was really taking charge of the design and direction. I felt like my input wasn’t being valued, and I started to feel frustrated. Instead of discussing this with her, I took matters into my own hands. I decided to change some of her designs without asking and added elements that I thought would make it “better.” 

When she saw what I had done, she was understandably upset. She told me that while she appreciated my enthusiasm, I had crossed a line by altering her work without her consent. I got defensive and argued that I was just trying to make it look good and that she was being too sensitive. I insisted that since I contributed more effort to the physical painting, it was only fair for me to have more say in the design.

After a heated argument, I walked out of her apartment, feeling justified in my actions. I thought I was being supportive by trying to improve the mural, but now I’m starting to wonder if I overstepped. 

AITA for taking control of the mural design despite it being my sister's project?

Edit: I acknowledge that I should have communicated with her instead of just changing things without discussing it. I guess I was just really excited about the project.",960,2329,0.67,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_81474,2020-01-31 00:00:00,YTA,1839,AITA
You're the Asshole,"My girlfriend and I have been together for about two years, and we both share a love for cooking. Recently, she got really into baking and has been experimenting with different recipes. She’s been working hard on perfecting a chocolate cake recipe, and I've been supportive, often taste-testing her creations.

Last week, she invited a few friends over for a small gathering and decided to bake her famous chocolate cake for the occasion. I thought it would be a good idea to surprise her by baking my own version of the cake and presenting it at the gathering. I’ve never baked a cake before, but I figured it couldn't be that hard. I found a recipe online that looked simple enough and got to work in the kitchen.

While I was baking, I didn’t really pay much attention to the time, and I ended up burning the cake. Not wanting to let my girlfriend down, I tried to salvage it by cutting off the burnt parts and slathering on a ton of frosting to hide the flaws. When it was time for dessert, I proudly presented my cake alongside hers, thinking it would be a fun little competition.

As soon as my girlfriend saw my cake, her face fell. She was visibly upset and tried to smile for our friends, but it was clear that she felt hurt that I didn’t just support her by bringing a store-bought dessert instead. When it was time to cut the cakes, I insisted that we all try mine first, confident that my friends would love it.

To my surprise, my cake was a disaster. The texture was off, and it turned out to be way too sweet. My friends tried to be polite, but they couldn’t hide their reactions. My girlfriend’s cake, on the other hand, was a hit, and they all raved about it. I felt embarrassed and started making jokes to lighten the mood, but in hindsight, I could see how my actions overshadowed her moment.

After the gathering, she confronted me about it, saying that I should have let her have her moment instead of trying to compete. I told her she was being too sensitive and that it was all in good fun. I’ve been feeling guilty since then, but I honestly thought I was just being playful and supportive.

So, AITA for trying to compete with my girlfriend's baking instead of simply supporting her?",617,2873,0.54,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_30175,2022-01-01 00:00:00,YTA,2208,AITA

He’s good at it and enjoys being part of the team. Lately, he’s been getting a lot of praise and attention for his skills, which is great for his self-esteem.

The issue came up when my daughter expressed interest in joining a local dance class. She’s always loved dancing and has been practicing some moves at home. I thought it was awesome that she wanted to pursue something she was passionate about, so I encouraged her to sign up. However, I made a comment that I now regret. I said something along the lines of, “Just remember that soccer is a real sport, and dance is a fun hobby.”

My daughter looked hurt, and my wife immediately jumped in to defend her. She told me that dance is just as much of a sport as soccer and that I shouldn’t belittle something our daughter loves. I brushed it off, thinking I was just being realistic. I thought I was being practical and trying to guide my children, but I now see how dismissive my comment was.

After that, my wife ended up having a long talk with me about how I should be more supportive of both kids in their interests, regardless of whether I consider them “real sports” or not. I dismissed her concerns at first, saying I was just being honest and that soccer was more competitive. But later, I realized I had hurt my daughter’s feelings and could have discouraged her passion.

Now, I feel bad about my comment and the way I approached the situation. I didn’t mean to come across as dismissive, but I did. Some friends say I was just trying to be a practical parent, but my wife insists I need to apologize to our daughter and show more support for her interests.

You're the Asshole,"Last week, I hosted a small gathering at my apartment to celebrate a friend's promotion. It was a relaxed affair with some snacks, drinks, and games. I had bought a couple of bottles of wine and a few six-packs of beer, but there were a lot of leftovers at the end of the night.

Instead of just keeping the leftover alcohol, I thought it would be a good idea to give it away. As I was walking home the next day, I passed a park where some people were sitting, enjoying the weather. I decided to approach them and offer them the leftover drinks. I handed out beers and wine to anyone who looked interested, thinking it would brighten their day.

One of the people I approached was a woman who looked a bit surprised but smiled and accepted a bottle of wine. I made a few jokes about how it was a great way to start the weekend, and everyone seemed to appreciate the gesture. I continued to hand out drinks, feeling like I was doing something nice.

Later, when I shared the story with my friends, they were quick to point out that not everyone appreciates or wants alcohol, especially in public spaces. Some mentioned that I could have been encouraging unhealthy habits or that some of the people I gave drinks to might have been struggling with addiction. I brushed off their concerns, insisting that I was just trying to spread some joy.

About a year ago, Sarah got into a serious relationship with Mike, who seemed like a great guy. They got engaged a few months later, and everyone was thrilled.

Recently, Sarah confided in me that she’s been feeling overwhelmed about the wedding planning. She mentioned that Mike has been pretty hands-off and just wants everything to be perfect without really contributing much. I listened to her vent and tried to be supportive, but I could tell she was really stressed out.

A couple of weeks ago, I had a party at my house. Sarah and Mike came, and everyone was having a good time.

He kept joking around and not taking things seriously, and it felt like she was trying to communicate her concerns but he wasn’t picking up on them.

In a moment of frustration, I jokingly said something like, “If you guys can’t even plan a wedding together, how are you going to plan a life together?” I thought it was a harmless comment, but I could see Sarah’s face drop. She looked visibly upset, and Mike tried to laugh it off, but the mood had already shifted.

After that, things got awkward. Sarah pulled me aside later and said that I shouldn’t have said that in front of everyone, especially since she was already feeling insecure about their relationship. I apologized, but I also mentioned that I was just trying to keep the mood light and that she needed to communicate better with Mike. I thought I was being a good friend by helping her see the reality of their situation.

This month, however, my friend Sarah, who recently went vegan, asked if we could get some plant-based options for pizza. I didn't think it was a big deal to accommodate her, so I suggested we order from the same place as last month and just add a vegan pizza for her. But she said she didn’t want to feel like an afterthought, and that we should consider getting pizza from a fully vegan place so she could enjoy a full meal with everyone, instead of just a single pizza among our usual choices.

I brushed it off, saying we should stick to the tradition and that it’s just one night. I even joked that it wouldn’t be fair to change everything just because she decided to switch her diet. My friends laughed, but I could tell Sarah was upset. 

When we got to game night, I ordered the usual pizzas for everyone and added one vegan pizza. Sarah looked annoyed, and when the food arrived, she barely touched her slice. I felt bad but thought she was overreacting. 

Later, I overheard her talking to another friend about feeling excluded and that it was frustrating to constantly have to adjust her meals for everyone else. I didn’t think it was a big deal because it was just one night and we’ve been doing this for years.

They often skip classes and I’ve caught them smoking a few times. I’ve expressed my concerns to Jake, but he brushes it off, saying he just wants to have fun and enjoy high school. 

A few weeks ago, he told me that he wanted to attend a weekend baseball tournament with his friends. I immediately said no because the tournament is far away, and I wasn’t comfortable with him being in a different city with this group. Instead, I suggested he stay home, focus on his studies, and maybe practice for his upcoming exams.

Jake got really upset and said that this tournament was important to him and that it was a chance for him to bond with his friends. I told him that if he wanted to hang out with these kids, he would have to earn my trust back, and right now, I didn’t think he was making the right choices. 

Instead of finding a compromise, I withdrew permission altogether. I then made plans to take his little sister to the beach that weekend without him. I told him that this was a perfect opportunity for him to reflect on his priorities and how he can gain back my trust, and that maybe next year he could go if he shows improvement.

A few months ago, my sister announced that she was pregnant and was over the moon about it. This was a huge deal for her, as she had been trying for a while and had some health issues that made it more difficult for her to conceive. I was genuinely happy for her, and we celebrated together.

However, shortly after her announcement, I found out that my wife (32F) and I were also expecting a baby.

As the party approached, Tom texted me saying he wasn’t sure if he could make it because Sarah was feeling under the weather and he didn’t want to leave her alone. I understood and didn’t press him on it. However, the day of the party, I saw on social media that he and Sarah went out for dinner instead. 

Feeling hurt and somewhat betrayed, I decided to uninvite him from the party, even though I had already sent out the invitations. I texted him, saying, “Hey, I saw you’re out, so I don’t think it’s fair for you to come to my party now.” He was shocked and confused, saying he had no idea I was throwing a party and that he would have loved to come if he had known. I stuck to my guns and told him I didn’t want someone who was prioritizing dinner over my birthday party to show up.

The night of the party, I had a great time with the friends who were there, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I’d overreacted. I also overheard some of my other friends discussing how unfair it was to uninvite Tom, especially since he didn’t even know about the party initially. 

Now I’m reflecting on my actions and wondering if I was too harsh. Should I have just communicated my feelings better instead of making a snap decision? So, Reddit, AITA for uninviting my best friend from my birthday party?",640,2173,0.9,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_53902,2020-12-30 00:00:00,YTA,1813,AITA
You're the Asshole,"Okay, I need some perspective on this situation, so here goes.

Last year, my sister had to move out of her apartment quickly due to some issues with her landlord. She was in a tough spot and needed a temporary place to stay. I offered her my guest room for a few months while she got back on her feet. She also has a cat, which she was concerned about because her old place was cat-friendly, and my apartment isn't. I told her that the cat could stay with me too, but only if she promised to take her back as soon as she found a new place.

Fast forward to now, and my sister has finally found a new apartment. She reached out to me last week, and I was so happy for her! But then she casually mentioned that she wanted me to keep her cat because she thinks it would be too stressful for the cat to move again. I was taken aback and reminded her of our original agreement. I told her that I really loved having the cat around, and I wasn't sure I wanted to give her back since we had developed a bond over the past year. 

My sister was clearly upset and said it wasn't fair for me to change the terms on her after she trusted me to take care of her cat. I felt bad, but I also don't want to lose the companionship I've grown to love. I argued that I had taken care of the cat for so long and that it was only fair I get to keep her.

Now I'm wondering if I'm being unreasonable. Am I the asshole for wanting to keep my sister's cat despite our original agreement?",439,1376,0.62,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_80423,2021-10-20 00:00:00,YTA,1465,AITA

I (30/m) have a close friend, Jake (32/m), who's been going through a tough time lately. He recently lost his job and has been struggling to make ends meet. I wanted to help him out, so I offered to treat him to dinner at this nice restaurant I love. He was really grateful and we had a great time catching up.

The next week, I invited him over to watch a football game. I made a big batch of chili, which is one of my specialties. I knew there would be leftovers, and I was looking forward to enjoying them for lunch the next few days. When Jake arrived, he seemed hungry and immediately started digging into the chili before we even sat down to watch the game. I thought it was a bit much, but I didn't say anything.

After the game, there was still a good amount of chili left, so I put it in the fridge to save for later. The next day, I was busy with work and didn't have time to cook, so I was really looking forward to heating up the leftovers for lunch. When I opened the fridge, I was shocked to find that Jake had come over again when I wasn't home and finished off the entire pot of chili! 

I was really upset and called him to confront him about it. He laughed it off and said he was just trying to help me out by ""cleaning up."" I ended up telling him that it was rude to eat food that wasn't offered to him, and that he should have asked first. He got defensive and said I was overreacting.

Now, I'm feeling guilty about how I handled the situation, but I can't shake the feeling that Jake was in the wrong for not respecting my food. AITA for being upset at him for eating my leftovers without asking?",802,756,0.69,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_94864,2019-09-18 00:00:00,YTA,1647,AITA

But here’s where I messed up. When we sat down to eat, I made a comment about how I didn’t want to try her dessert because I had spent so much time making the meal and didn’t want anything to overshadow it. I acted a little dismissively and insisted that we focus on my food first. 

Sarah looked hurt and tried to share her dessert, but I kept insisting that my meal was the main event. I even made a joke about how she should just take it home since I didn’t want it to distract from my hard work. The mood shifted, and my friends ended up just eating my food without really enjoying the evening.

So, here's the situation: I (26M) have a younger sister, Jenny (22F), who has been dating her boyfriend, Mark (24M), for about a year now. I never really liked Mark; he seems nice enough on the surface, but he has a habit of being very overly critical of Jenny in a way that makes me uncomfortable. I’ve seen him belittle her about her cooking, her job choices, and even her hobbies. I’ve expressed my concerns to Jenny a couple of times, but she always brushes me off, saying that he just wants the best for her.

Recently, Jenny invited me to a dinner at their apartment, and I was a bit anxious about it. Despite my reservations, I decided to go, hoping to keep the peace. During dinner, Mark started making jokes about Jenny’s cooking, which wasn’t great, but it was edible. He kept saying things like, “Wow, did you burn this on purpose?” and “Are you sure you didn’t use the wrong recipe?” I could see Jenny getting visibly uncomfortable, and it was painful to watch. 

After a few rounds of comments, I snapped. I told Mark to lay off and that he should appreciate the effort Jenny put into the meal, even if it wasn’t perfect. I added something like, “If you keep talking to her like that, you’re going to push her away.” Mark got defensive and said I had no right to interfere in their relationship. Jenny looked upset, and the atmosphere turned tense. 

After dinner, as I was leaving, Jenny confronted me about what I said. She told me I embarrassed her in front of Mark and that I should have just kept my mouth shut. I tried to explain that I was just trying to stand up for her, but she didn’t want to hear it. She said I made it worse and that she didn’t need me to fight her battles.

Now, I feel really guilty. I thought I was helping her, but maybe I overstepped. I didn’t intend to ruin their evening, and I definitely didn’t mean to put her in a tough spot. I’m torn.

I wasn’t in the mood to chat, so I bluntly said, “I don’t want to talk right now, just give me my order.” He looked surprised but went ahead and prepared my drink. I could see him trying to engage me again as he handed it over, but I just grabbed it and walked away without saying anything else.

Later that day, I was hanging out with some friends and mentioned my interaction at the coffee shop. They were shocked and told me that I was rude to Jake. They said he was just trying to be friendly and polite, and I should have at least acknowledged his efforts. I brushed it off, thinking I was justified since I was having a tough day.

However, I also have a habit of being a bit too controlling about the way things should be done. When Mark came over for the first time, I had everything planned out. I wanted us to have a healthy breakfast, so I prepared a smoothie bowl and insisted we eat it outside because I thought it would be a nice start to the day. 

When we sat down, I noticed that Mark was just staring at the bowl and seemed hesitant to eat. I asked him what was wrong, and he told me he wasn’t a fan of smoothie bowls and preferred something simpler like toast or cereal. Instead of respecting his preference, I kind of blew up and told him that he needed to be more adventurous with his food choices and that he should try it because it was good for him. 

I kept pushing him to eat it, and he eventually did, but I could tell he wasn’t enjoying it. Instead of just letting it go, I jokingly mocked him for being picky, saying he should “expand his horizons” and that he was missing out on delicious food.

You're the Asshole,"For context: I (28F) have a younger brother, Jake (22M), who has always been a bit of a jokester. He loves pulling pranks on people, and while some can be funny, others cross the line. Recently, he got a new girlfriend, Sarah (23F), and I was excited to finally meet her.

The actual scenario: A few weeks ago, Jake invited me over for dinner with Sarah. He decided it would be fun to pull a ""prank"" on her. He told me beforehand that he was going to pretend to propose to me in front of her, just to see her reaction. I thought it was a terrible idea, especially considering how serious relationships can be, but I reluctantly agreed because I didn't want to ruin his fun.

During dinner, Jake announced that he had something important to say and got down on one knee, holding a fake ring. Sarah looked shocked, and I could see her face turning red with embarrassment. Instead of stopping, Jake laughed and said, ""Just kidding! I’m not proposing to her, but it was fun to watch you sweat!"" Sarah's face dropped, and she looked really uncomfortable.

After dinner, Sarah pulled me aside and told me that she was really upset about the whole situation. I tried to explain that it was all in good fun, but she didn't see it that way. I told her she was overreacting and that Jake was just being himself. I even insisted that she should lighten up and realize that it was a joke.

A few days later, Jake called me to say that Sarah had broken up with him because she felt disrespected by the prank. I felt bad for Jake, but I still didn't think I did anything wrong. I thought it was just a harmless joke. 

Now I’m feeling conflicted. Was I wrong for supporting Jake in this? Did I contribute to the breakup by not taking Sarah's feelings seriously?

You're the Asshole,"I just had a big family gathering for my sister's birthday, and I’m still reeling from what happened. First off, I want to say that I love my sister dearly, but I can be a bit insensitive sometimes. 

So my sister is a huge fan of a particular music artist, and she had been planning this birthday party for months. She even booked a local venue and invited all her friends and family. I knew how much this meant to her, but honestly, I couldn't care less about the artist or their music. I thought I’d just go for a couple of hours, be polite, and then leave.

The night of the party, I showed up and immediately felt out of place since the venue was decorated with everything related to the artist. The music was blasting, and everyone was having a great time. I stood there for a while, trying to muster some enthusiasm, but I just couldn’t get into it. I felt like I was wasting my time, so I started making snarky comments about the music and the decorations, joking about how over-the-top it all was.

At one point, I even mocked a few of the songs in front of my sister's friends, thinking they would find it funny. Instead, I noticed that my sister looked really hurt. A few of her friends told me to stop, but I kept going, thinking I was just being funny and that everyone would lighten up. Eventually, my sister pulled me aside and asked me to be respectful, saying it was her special day and that I was ruining it for her. I rolled my eyes and told her she was being overly dramatic.

After that, I decided to leave early, and now I’m wondering if I was really the asshole for not being supportive of her interests and making fun of something that made her happy. So, Reddit, AITA?",143,1354,0.97,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_50831,2021-12-05 00:00:00,YTA,1693,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I work at a small local bakery, and we often get regular customers who come in every week. There’s this elderly couple that comes in every Saturday morning. They’re super sweet and have always been polite to the staff, often chatting with us and sharing stories about their lives. 

One day, I noticed that they were struggling a bit financially. They would pull out coupons or count their change carefully, and I could see the embarrassment on their faces when they couldn't cover their total. Instead of just letting it go, I started covering their orders without telling them. I thought I was doing a good deed and it felt nice to help them out.

Last Saturday, they came in as usual, and I had covered their order again. But this time, when they came to pick up their pastries, I figured I’d let them know what I was doing. I mentioned casually that I had been covering their orders for a while now. They looked shocked, and I could tell they felt really uncomfortable. They thanked me, but I could see that they didn’t want to be a burden.

Well, the following Saturday, they came in again, but this time they insisted on paying for their own food, even though I had planned to cover it again. I felt frustrated that they wouldn’t accept my help and told them that I was just trying to do something nice for them. They explained that they didn’t want to feel like they were taking advantage of me or anyone else. 

I snapped a little and told them that they shouldn’t be so prideful and that I was just trying to show kindness. Now they seem distant and I feel like I ruined a good relationship with them. I really thought I was doing a good thing, but now I’m wondering if I overstepped.

You're the Asshole,"I (27M) have been dating my girlfriend (25F) for about six months. She's a really nice person, super sweet and caring, but she can be a bit sensitive about certain topics. We come from different backgrounds—she was raised in a very conservative household, while my family is more liberal and open-minded.

Last weekend, I was invited to a friend's get-together. It was just a casual hangout at his place, but it was going to involve some light drinking and a few of my friends joking around about more risqué topics. I knew that my girlfriend would likely be uncomfortable with some of the conversations and jokes that might come up since she's not really into that kind of humor. 

When I mentioned the party to her, she seemed a bit apprehensive and asked what kind of people would be there. I told her it was mostly my college friends, and while she trusted me, I could tell she didn't feel entirely at ease. I thought it would be better for her if I just went alone, so I decided not to invite her.

The night of the party, I had a great time, but I felt a bit guilty when I got texts from her asking what I was up to. I ended up telling her I was at the party, and she expressed that she wished I had invited her. She said she would have liked to meet my friends, even if she wasn't sure she'd enjoy it. I brushed it off, saying I thought it would be better this way since I wanted her to be comfortable.

Afterwards, she brought it up again and said she felt excluded and that it hurt her feelings. I argued that I was just trying to protect her from a situation that might make her uncomfortable. In hindsight, I realize I probably should have invited her regardless of my assumptions about her comfort level. I can see now that it wasn't my place to decide for her what she would enjoy or not.

Last week, she had a really rough day, and I wanted to surprise her by cooking her favorite dinner—chicken Alfredo. I thought it would be a nice gesture to cheer her up. I found the ingredients in the fridge, but when I went to grab the chicken, I discovered that it was the last of what we had. 

Now, here’s where I might have messed up. I knew she had planned to use that chicken for lunch the next day, but I was really set on making this dinner for her. I figured she wouldn’t mind, since I was trying to do something nice for her. So, I ended up using the chicken and made the Alfredo.

When she came home and saw what I had cooked, she was really upset and told me that she was looking forward to having that chicken for her lunch. I felt a bit guilty, but I thought my intentions were good. I mean, I really wanted to make her happy.

You're the Asshole,"So, I (27M) have a close-knit group of friends that I hang out with regularly. We've been friends for years and have a pretty solid routine: game nights, movie marathons, and the occasional weekend getaway. Recently, one of my friends, Jake (28M), started dating this girl, Emily (26F), and things started getting serious. 

At first, I was excited for them, but as time went on, I noticed that Emily was kind of... insufferable. She constantly interrupted conversations, made snarky comments about things she clearly didn’t understand, and just had this air of superiority that rubbed me the wrong way. The group started to notice these things too. 

One night, we were all at my place having a game night when Emily made a particularly rude remark about my gaming skills. I snapped a bit and jokingly said, ""Well, if we were playing ‘How to Be a Know-It-All,’ you’d win hands down!"" Everyone laughed, but Emily shot me this icy glare and went quiet for the rest of the night. I thought it was just a joke and didn’t think much of it.

A few days later, Jake reached out to me, saying he was upset about the way I treated Emily and that I should apologize. I was taken aback; I didn't think I did anything wrong. I told Jake I wouldn’t apologize because I felt I was just expressing how everyone felt about her behavior. He was really hurt and said it felt like I was being a poor friend to both him and Emily.

I didn’t back down. Instead, I continued to make snide comments about Emily during our next game night. I thought I was just being funny and keeping it real. I told Jake that if he wanted to be with Emily, he could go ahead, but I wasn’t going to change how I felt about her. 

Eventually, after a few more confrontations, Jake decided he needed to take a step back from our friendship for a while to focus on his relationship. I felt justified, thinking that I was just being honest and true to myself. But now, looking back, I realize I was being a total jerk. I could have handled it way better, and I ended up pushing away a good friend because of my attitude.

You're the Asshole,"I (30M) have a close-knit group of friends, and we regularly hang out together. One friend, Jake (32M), recently had a baby with his partner, and they've been adjusting to parenthood. They've been understandably busy, but I’ve been trying to be supportive, checking in and offering help when I can.

So, a few weeks ago, I decided to throw a small get-together at my place to celebrate Jake and his partner's new arrival. I invited a few friends, including Jake and his partner, and planned some fun activities for the evening. However, when I sent out the invites, I jokingly mentioned that I would be serving drinks and food that are ""not baby-approved,"" like beer and spicy wings.

The day of the get-together, Jake and his partner arrived with their baby, and while the party was mostly fun, I noticed that Jake seemed a bit off. At one point, I made a comment about how he should ""leave the parenting to the professionals"" and let loose for one night. In hindsight, I realize that this was insensitive, considering how overwhelming new parenthood can be.

As the night progressed, I saw that Jake was getting visibly uncomfortable with the noise and the atmosphere. I kept trying to get him to relax and join in on the fun, joking that he should take a break from being so serious. I even played some loud music and encouraged everyone to dance, despite Jake's obvious discomfort.

Eventually, Jake and his partner decided to leave early. After they left, I got a message from Jake saying that he appreciated the invite but that my comments and the atmosphere made him feel like his priorities as a parent were being belittled. He said he felt like I was ignoring the challenges they were facing and that it was a bit hurtful.

Looking back, I realize that I made some poor choices with my jokes and didn't consider how my behavior might affect Jake, especially as a new parent. I thought I was just trying to lighten the mood, but I can see how it came off differently. Now I’m wondering if I was being an asshole for not being more considerate of Jake's situation.

You're the Asshole,"I've been really wrestling with some feelings lately, and I think I need to share my situation to see if I'm in the wrong here.

So, I've had a best friend, ""Sarah,"" for over a decade. We went through high school together, shared countless experiences, and have always been there for each other. Recently, Sarah got engaged, and I was thrilled for her. She's been planning her wedding for almost a year now, and I've been involved in the preparations, helping her with ideas and stuff.

However, a couple of months ago, I accepted a position at a new job that requires me to travel a lot. I had been looking for a job like this for years, and it was a dream come true for me. Unfortunately, the job's schedule because of an important project means I'll be out of town on the dates of her wedding.

I told Sarah about my new job when I accepted it, and I could see she was disappointed about me not being there. But honestly, I figured she would understand that my career is really important to me. I tried to reassure her that I would make it up to her in other ways.

A few weeks later, out of the blue, Sarah texted me and asked if I would still be able to attend her wedding now that I had a better idea of my schedule. I thought about it and, in my head, I just thought: ""It's just a wedding, and I have my whole career to think about."" So instead of being honest about it, I told her I might be able to swing a last-minute flight if things worked out. In reality, I was pretty sure I wouldn’t.

When she finally sent the invites, I noticed that she put a lot of effort into them. I felt this pang of guilt for not just being upfront with her, but I brushed it off because I thought my job was more important. I texted her back saying I might be able to come, but I kept my travel plans vague.

Then, last week, she called me, clearly upset. She asked me directly if I was going to come to the wedding, and I hesitated. I could hear the disappointment in her voice, and it hit me that I had been selfish about the whole situation. Instead of admitting I wasn’t coming, I tried to deflect and said I was still trying to figure it out.

After the call, I felt bad and posted on social media about my new job, celebrating my achievements and how excited I was for the future. I thought it would be encouraging, but I didn’t realize it would make Sarah feel even worse because she couldn’t help but compare it to her big day.

A few days later, she wrote me a message saying she felt let down and that it wasn’t just about the wedding but about our friendship and support for each other. I got defensive and told her she was being overly dramatic and that she should be happy for me. I also said she should understand that I have to prioritize my career.

Now, I’m wondering if I messed up. I feel like I was just being realistic about my life choices, but maybe I was a jerk for not being more supportive of her big day.

He looked shocked and said, ""Dude, what the hell? I was saving those for later."" I shrugged it off, thinking I was just being playful, and said, ""Come on, it was a bet!"" 

After that, he got really quiet, and I could tell he was upset. I didn’t think it was that big of a deal, but he ended up kicking me out of his room. I felt like he was overreacting, so I told him he was being dramatic.

My boyfriend has been incredibly supportive of her, which I totally understand, but it's starting to affect our relationship in a big way.

He wants to invite her over for dinner more frequently and even suggested that she might need a place to stay for a while if she gets overwhelmed at their parents' house. At first, I thought he was just being kind, but then it became clear that he was considering letting her stay with us—not just for a few nights, but potentially for an extended period.

I have always been clear about needing my own space, especially after a long day at work. The thought of having someone else living in our space, especially someone who isn’t contributing to the household, felt suffocating to me. I expressed my concerns and told him that I felt like I would be sacrificing my comfort and boundaries for his sister’s situation. I suggested that maybe he could help her without her living with us, like encouraging her to find a therapist or helping her with some practical life skills.

When I brought this up, he got really upset. He said I was being unsupportive and that family should come first. He accused me of being selfish for not wanting to help his sister during a tough time. Honestly, I think he’s just not seeing how this would impact our relationship, our daily lives, and my mental health. So, I stood my ground and told him I wouldn’t be comfortable having her live with us.

For some context, my sister (27F) has been struggling with her health for the past year. She's been in and out of the hospital, and it’s been really tough on her. I've been trying to support her as best as I can, but I also have my own life and responsibilities.

Recently, my sister organized a small get-together with a few close friends to celebrate her improving health. She invited our family, including me (30M), but I was feeling overwhelmed with work and personal issues, so I decided to decline the invite. I told her I was too busy and wouldn’t be able to make it.

A few days later, I saw on social media that my sister posted a bunch of photos from the gathering, and she was having a great time. I felt a bit left out, but I brushed it off. However, during a family dinner a week later, I jokingly mentioned that I had friends over that weekend, trying to lighten the mood. 

My sister looked hurt and confronted me about how I couldn’t even make time for her when she needed support, yet I found time for my friends. I insisted I was just busy and didn’t mean to hurt her feelings. My parents jumped in, saying I should have made an effort to be there for her given everything she’s going through.

I still think I was justified in putting my own needs first, and I didn’t think attending the gathering was that important. Now I’m wondering if I really messed up by not being there for her.

Since Sarah has always loved the beach, I decided to book a weekend getaway for a small group of her closest friends at a beach house. I invited Sarah's friends from college and a couple of our family members, including our younger cousin, Lucy, who is 19.

Lucy has been really excited about the wedding, and I thought it would be great for her to join us. However, I didn’t consider that there might be a clash of personalities. The college friends are all in their mid-20s, and they enjoy partying and staying out late, while Lucy is more reserved and doesn't drink much. As the planning progressed, I could see that Lucy felt a bit out of place, but I brushed it off, thinking she’d have fun once the party started.

On the first night of the bachelorette party, we went to a bar and I encouraged everyone to have a good time. I bought a round of shots for everyone, including Lucy. I figured it would help her loosen up and join in on the fun. She took one shot and then opted out of the rest, saying she was feeling uncomfortable. Instead of respecting her wishes, I kept insisting she join us for more drinks, promising it would make her feel included. I even made a few jokes about her being such a lightweight.

The atmosphere shifted a bit after that, and I noticed Lucy was visibly upset. I should have stopped pushing her, but I wanted the party to be fun and felt that if everyone was drinking, she should too. After a while, she excused herself and went back to the beach house, saying she needed some air. A few minutes later, she texted me that she felt unwelcome and that I was being inconsiderate. I brushed it off, thinking she was overreacting.

I felt defensive and told Sarah that I just wanted everyone to have a good time together, and that Lucy should toughen up a bit and join in.

Now, my sister isn’t speaking to me, and Lucy is not coming to the wedding because she feels hurt. I genuinely don’t think I did anything wrong and that I was just trying to make the party fun. AITA?",640,1949,0.66,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_69286,2020-07-30 00:00:00,YTA,2347,AITA

I’ve always been a staunch meat-eater, and I take every opportunity to joke about how much I love meat and how “boring” plant-based food is. I thought it would be funny to make a comment about how she must be starving herself with her diet, and I loudly declared to the whole table that I would never give up my steak for anything.

Instead of laughing it off, my cousin got visibly upset and said she loved her lifestyle and that it was a choice she felt strongly about. I replied with a laugh, dismissing her feelings and saying, “Oh come on, don’t be so sensitive!

During the party, I noticed that my dog was getting a bit overwhelmed with all the noise and excitement. There were about ten people in my small apartment, and she was starting to hide under the couch. I figured that she might just need a little attention, so I decided to put her in a cute costume I had bought for her—a little superhero outfit.

However, I've been struggling with some personal issues, mainly around my mental health. I’ve been feeling really down and unmotivated, but I've kept it all to myself because I didn't want to burden her with my problems.

Recently, she planned this surprise weekend getaway for us to help us reconnect and have some fun together. I appreciate her effort and know she was excited about it.

You're the Asshole,"I’ve been reflecting on a situation with my roommate, and I’m starting to think I might be the one in the wrong. 

We’ve been living together for about a year, and we’re generally good friends. Recently, I decided to get a cat. I’ve always wanted one, and after doing some research and preparations, I adopted a sweet little kitten. I was really excited and thought my roommate would be too since she loves animals.

The day I brought the kitten home, my roommate was at work. I sent her a text with a photo of the kitten and said, “Look who I adopted! Can’t wait for you to meet her!” When she got home, she was surprised, but her reaction was more like shock than joy. She told me she wasn’t really on board with having a cat in the apartment because she has allergies. I didn’t think it would be a big deal since I had taken precautions—like keeping the cat out of her room and using air purifiers.

However, as the days went by, my roommate started to get more and more frustrated. She would sneeze and complain about the cat’s fur even though I was doing my best to keep the place clean. I brushed the cat daily and made sure to vacuum often. Despite my efforts, she told me that she just couldn’t handle it and that I needed to find a new home for the cat. I ignored her request, thinking she would eventually get used to having the cat around.

Things escalated when I started posting cute photos of my kitten on social media, and my roommate commented on them saying how much she hated living with a cat. I felt hurt and embarrassed by her comments, especially since many of our friends saw them. I confronted her about it, and we had a heated argument where I insisted she was overreacting and being unreasonable. I told her it was my apartment too and that I had the right to have a pet.

You're the Asshole,"I’m in a bit of a mess right now and could really use some outside perspective. So, I (34M) have a younger brother (25M) who has been really struggling financially for the past few years. He lost his job during the pandemic and has been bouncing from one dead-end job to another since then. My parents have always been supportive and have helped him out whenever they could, but they’re getting tired of it and are starting to push him to find something stable.

A few weeks ago, my brother came to me asking for help with rent. He needed $1,500 to cover the next month, and he promised he would pay me back as soon as he found a better job. I was hesitant because I’ve been saving up for a vacation I’ve been planning for a long time, and I didn’t want to dip into my savings. But after some back-and-forth, I agreed to loan him the money, thinking it might help him get back on his feet.

Fast forward to last week, and I found out that he used the money to buy a brand new gaming console and some expensive games instead of paying his rent. I was furious when I confronted him about it. He tried to justify it by saying he needed something to distract him from his stress and that he would get the money for rent soon. I ended up yelling at him, calling him irresponsible and selfish.

Now he’s upset with me, saying I overreacted and that I should have been more understanding of his situation. I’m starting to feel guilty because I did agree to help him out, and maybe I should have been more supportive instead of just getting angry. But I can’t help but feel like he completely disrespected my kindness.

So, AITA for getting mad at my brother for using the money I loaned him for rent to buy a gaming console instead?",919,2474,0.87,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_70754,2018-09-23 00:00:00,YTA,1725,AITA
You're the Asshole,"Title: AITA for telling my sister her wedding plans are ridiculous?

So, I (28F) have a younger sister (25F) who recently got engaged. She’s super excited and has been planning her wedding for a while now. The thing is, her vision for the wedding is just so over the top that I can’t help but think it’s a bit ridiculous.

She wants to have a destination wedding at this luxury resort in Bali, which is fine, but then she mentioned she wants to fly out everyone she’s invited, including all of our extended family, and put them up in the resort for a week. She’s also talking about hiring a famous wedding planner and a ton of professional photographers and videographers to capture every moment. It’s just insane how much money she’s planning to spend!

When she shared these plans with me, I thought I should be honest and let her know how unrealistic this all sounds. I told her that not everyone will be able to afford to go, and that she might end up with a smaller guest list than she imagined. I even brought up how she’s putting a lot of pressure on herself and her fiancé to execute this huge event, which could take away from the joy of getting married.

She got really upset and accused me of trying to ruin her happiness and not being supportive. I felt bad, but I honestly thought I was just looking out for her. The way I see it, weddings are supposed to be about love, not about how extravagant they can be. Now she’s not talking to me and my parents are saying I should apologize for being negative.

I’m starting to think maybe I was too harsh. AITA for telling her her wedding plans are ridiculous?",951,1218,0.8,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_14617,2022-06-20 00:00:00,YTA,1616,AITA

My husband and I have worked hard to build a comfortable life, and we have certain expectations for our son regarding his future.

Recently, my son told me that he wants to propose to her. I was shocked and didn’t hold back my feelings about it. I sat him down and told him that I think he's making a huge mistake. I expressed my concerns about her not having the same values and ambitions as us, and I outright told him that I don't believe she is ""good enough"" for him.

I then said that if he chooses to marry her, I will not support him financially or emotionally. I even went so far as to say that he could ""lose his inheritance"" if he decides to go through with it. My son was understandably upset and argued back, saying he loves her and that my attitude is pushing him away.

In the end, he said he needs to reconsider his relationship and is now feeling really torn between us and his girlfriend.

My best friend just got a new puppy, and she's been so excited about it. She's been posting a ton of pictures and videos on social media, and I can tell she's really in love with this little guy. So naturally, I offered to come over and meet him. I expected to have a nice time hanging out with my friend and her new pup.

When I arrived, she was so enthusiastic, introducing me to the puppy and showing me all his toys. He was being cute and playful, and I could see how happy he made her. But then, for whatever reason, I started making jokes about how much of a ""disaster"" puppies can be—chewing everything up, peeing everywhere, being a little tornado of chaos. I thought I was being funny, and I might have gotten a little carried away with it, exaggerating the mischief puppies get into.

My friend’s face started to fall as I kept going on about how puppies are just a huge handful and can ruin your life. I thought I was being lighthearted, but she eventually told me that she was really stressed about keeping her puppy trained and that my comments were hitting too close to home. I brushed it off, thinking she was being overly sensitive.

Later on, as we were playing with the puppy, I made another offhand comment about how her life would be so much easier without the little guy. I thought it was just a funny remark, but she snapped at me, saying I was being rude and unsupportive. It caught me off guard, and I got defensive, saying I was just joking and that she needed to lighten up.

In hindsight, I realize that I overshadowed her excitement with my jokes and didn’t consider how she felt about her new puppy. It feels bad to think I might have made her feel bad about something she loves so much.

So last weekend, I decided to throw a little party at my apartment to celebrate my new job. I invited a few close friends and some colleagues, and I was really looking forward to it. I wanted it to be a fun night, and I thought it would be a great way to unwind after a stressful few months.

As the night went on, people were having a good time, but I noticed that my neighbor, who had been living next door for a few months, was trying to enjoy a quiet evening. I could hear her voice over the music, and I felt bad that we were affecting her night. But instead of telling my guests to keep it down, I decided it would be more fun to crank up the music even louder. After all, it was my celebration.

I justified my decision by thinking that it was only one night and that she should understand that parties happen sometimes. I didn’t really care if she was annoyed because, honestly, I was in the mood to celebrate. I also thought it was a bit petty for her to get upset over a party anyway.

At one point, I noticed she was knocking on the wall, but I just turned the music up even more, thinking it was all in good fun. My friends were laughing and dancing, and I didn’t want to ruin the vibe. I figured she could just deal with it.

The next day, I got a text from her expressing how upset she was that I kept her up until 3 AM with the noise. She said she had an important presentation the next day and couldn’t focus because of the party. I felt a little bad but mostly brushed it off, thinking she was being overly dramatic.

Now, I’m wondering if I overstepped by not caring about her feelings at all during my celebration. AITA?",194,1927,0.79,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_25721,2024-04-23 00:00:00,YTA,1659,AITA

The other day, she sent out a team email asking for feedback on her work, which was completely reasonable. However, I was having a really stressful day and felt overwhelmed with my own tasks. I took a quick glance at her project and thought it could use some improvement. Instead of sending her a private message to discuss my thoughts, I decided to reply-all to the email with my critiques, thinking I was being helpful.

In my email, I pointed out several flaws and suggested changes, but I was pretty blunt and didn’t sugarcoat my feedback. I assumed everyone would appreciate the honesty, but I could tell from the silence that I had crossed a line. A few minutes later, Sarah replied, clearly upset, saying that she had put her heart into the project and my comments had hurt her feelings.

I felt bad after reading her response, but I justified my actions by thinking that I was just trying to help the team improve.

Last month, we had a party at my place, and Jamie was there. After a few drinks, she pulled me aside and shared that she wasn't quite ready for marriage yet. She said that while she loves Alex, she feels pressured to get engaged because everyone expects it. She also mentioned that she has been thinking about taking a break from the relationship to figure out what she really wants. I could tell she was conflicted and stressed about it.

I love cooking and usually make a large dish to contribute. However, I’ve noticed that one of my coworkers, Sarah, often brings store-bought snacks like chips or cookies, which I find a bit lazy. I mean, it’s a potluck; the point is to share homemade food, right?

So one day, I decided to take it upon myself to ""help"" Sarah learn how to cook. I offered to teach her a simple recipe for a pasta salad that’s always a hit. She seemed a bit hesitant but agreed. I spent a couple of hours prepping and cooking at my house, only to find out that she didn’t really want to participate as much as I thought. She mostly just watched and occasionally chopped some vegetables. 

When the day of the potluck came, I was excited to see everyone enjoying the salad. However, Sarah showed up with her own dish, a store-bought veggie platter, and when I saw it, I felt a wave of frustration.

I’m wondering if I crossed a line with my friend and if I’m the asshole in this situation. 

So, I have this close friend, Sarah, who recently started a new job. She’s been feeling overwhelmed with the workload and has been stressed out. To help her out, I decided to invite her over to my place for a movie night, thinking it would be a nice break for her.

I told her I’d cook dinner and provide snacks, and she seemed really excited about it. I spent a few hours preparing a nice meal and picking out some of her favorite movies. When she arrived, I could see she was a bit tired, but she still seemed happy.

However, during dinner, I casually mentioned that I had made this dish using a couple of pricey ingredients that I got on sale, and I ended up dropping a hint about how much I spent. I didn’t mean to brag, but I thought it would be interesting to share how I made the meal. 

As we started watching the movie, I noticed she was pretty quiet. After a little while, she told me she appreciated the effort but felt bad because she couldn’t contribute much to the night since she had been so overwhelmed with work and hadn’t had time to buy snacks or drinks. I shrugged it off and said, “Well, I’m the one who invited you, so it’s on me!” 

But later, she brought up how she felt uncomfortable because I had spent money on the meal, and I responded with, “It’s not a big deal, I wanted to do this for you.” I didn’t mean to make her feel bad, but I kind of insisted that I was fine spending the money. 

Now, looking back, I realize I might have pressured her into feeling like she owed me something for the dinner, even though that wasn’t my intention. I’m wondering if I was being rude by bringing up the cost and making her feel uncomfortable about it.

I completely understood and told her that it was okay if she didn't come—her mental health was more important than a party. I even offered to do something one-on-one with her another time to celebrate.

On the day of the party, I noticed that one of our mutual friends, Emily, had invited Sarah on her own. To be honest, I felt a bit annoyed.

1. Last month, my wife celebrated her birthday. I completely forgot about it until the day before, and I ended up planning a last-minute dinner at a restaurant with just the two of us. I didn’t invite anyone else, including her family, because I didn't have time to arrange anything more elaborate.

2. When we arrived at the restaurant, my wife seemed disappointed that I hadn’t organized a bigger celebration. I could tell she was hoping for something more special, maybe a surprise party or at least a gathering with family and friends. I brushed it off, saying we’d celebrate properly next year.

Now, here’s where I might have messed up. One of my friends, Sarah, has a pretty tough life right now. She’s going through a lot, including a recent breakup, and has been pretty down. I know she struggles with her self-esteem and often feels out of place in social situations. 

The night of the party arrived, and most of my friends put in a lot of effort with their costumes. However, Sarah showed up without a costume at all. She wore a simple sweater and jeans. When I saw her, instead of being supportive, I couldn’t help but make a comment. I said, “Wow, did you not get the memo about the costume? This is a costume party!”

That’s when I mentioned that I would expect her to help out around the house — things like cleaning, grocery shopping, and cooking. To be honest, I thought this was a reasonable expectation since I’d be providing her a place to stay for free.

Mia immediately got upset. She told me that she didn’t want to live in a situation where she felt like a burden and that she was already stressed about her jobs. I firmly told her that if she wanted to live with me, she had to contribute somehow. She argued that it didn’t seem fair since she’d be moving back with her older sister and should be allowed to relax and not feel like she had to do chores.

I stood my ground and told her that I was not a hotel and that if she wanted to save money, she needed to pull her weight. After a lot of back and forth, she ended up storming out. Now, she’s staying with a friend, and our parents are upset with me for how I handled the situation, saying I should have been more supportive.

I still think my expectations were reasonable, but now I’m starting to feel guilty. Was I too harsh on her? AITA?",509,1741,0.73,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_65010,2022-08-16 00:00:00,YTA,1867,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I am a 27M and recently had a falling out with my long-time friend, 26F. We've known each other for over a decade and have always been there for each other through thick and thin. However, things took a turn when she recently started dating someone seriously.

When she first introduced me to her boyfriend, I tried to be supportive, but I noticed that he didn't seem to like me very much. He often made snide comments about our friendship, suggesting that I was too close to her and trying to come between them. I brushed it off at first, but it started to annoy me. 

One night, my friend invited me to a dinner party at her place to celebrate her new relationship. I was excited to go, but as soon as I arrived, I could tell the vibe was off. Her boyfriend was cold towards me, and whenever I tried to engage in conversation, he would interrupt or talk over me. I made a few jokes to lighten the mood, but he just rolled his eyes.

Frustrated, I decided to get my point across. During dinner, I made a comment about how I was glad to see her “finally upgrade to someone less boring” since she used to date a guy I thought was a total loser. I thought I was being funny, but the whole room went silent. My friend looked really upset, and her boyfriend's face turned red with anger.

She pulled me aside after dinner and called me out for being rude. I didn’t think I was being that harsh—I was just joking around. I told her that if her boyfriend couldn't take a joke, maybe he wasn't the right guy for her. She said I was being disrespectful and that I should’ve been more supportive of her choices.

I felt justified in my actions, but after talking to a mutual friend, they suggested I might have crossed a line. I still think my friend is overreacting, but I’m starting to wonder if I was too harsh.

You're the Asshole,"Title: AITA for telling my best friend to stop being so sensitive about her wedding plans?

So, I'm in a bit of a situation with my best friend, and I'm starting to feel like I might be in the wrong here. 

My friend is getting married next year, and ever since she got engaged, she's been super obsessed with planning every tiny detail of her wedding. Don't get me wrong, I think it's great to be excited, but she keeps bringing it up in every conversation we have, and it's starting to drive me crazy. I mean, I have my own life to deal with, and I don't need to hear about her seating chart for the umpteenth time. 

The other day, we were hanging out, and she started showing me pictures of wedding dresses she liked. I was honestly just trying to change the subject because I was getting bored, so I jokingly said, ""Maybe you should just elope and save everyone the headache."" I thought it would lighten the mood, but she looked really hurt and said that planning her wedding was important to her and that she didn't appreciate me downplaying it.

I shrugged it off, but she kept bringing it up, saying I was being unsupportive and that I should be happy for her. I told her that I just wanted to talk about something else for a change and that I felt like she was making everything about her wedding. I thought I was being honest, but she ended up crying and saying that I was ruining one of the happiest times of her life.

Now, I feel bad that I hurt her feelings, but I still think I have a point. I just want her to understand that there's more to life than wedding planning. AITA for telling her to stop being so sensitive about her wedding?",525,2969,0.95,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_84233,2021-06-28 00:00:00,YTA,1652,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I've been dating my girlfriend ""Sarah"" for about a year now. She’s really talented and has been pursuing her passion for painting. Recently, she had a big opportunity to showcase her work at a local gallery, which she was really excited about. I was proud of her and offered to help her set up for the exhibit.

The day of the exhibit, I was there to support her. But, as we were setting things up, I noticed that a few of her paintings were getting a lot of attention from people who were visiting the gallery. I thought it would be funny to give her a little playful pep talk to boost her confidence.

In the middle of the crowd, I started joking about how she should really charge more for her paintings because they’re “so good they might as well be sold at a museum.” I added something like, “If she gets famous, she better not forget about the little people like me!” 

I thought I was being funny and supportive, but Sarah turned bright red and looked really uncomfortable. A few people in the crowd laughed, but she quickly told me to stop and that it wasn't funny. I thought she was just being overly sensitive, so I continued joking around, saying things like, “Come on, I’m just trying to give you a taste of your future fame!”

After the exhibit, Sarah was upset with me. She said I embarrassed her in front of everyone and that it made her feel like her work wasn’t being taken seriously. I thought I was just being supportive and lighthearted, but she told me that my jokes made her feel belittled and anxious about her art.

I brushed it off, thinking she would get over it, but she’s still upset and hasn’t really talked to me since. I’ve tried to apologize, but she just keeps saying that I don’t understand how important this opportunity was to her and that I ruined it.

Was I the asshole here?",125,1991,0.93,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_77373,2019-03-18 00:00:00,YTA,1813,AITA
You're the Asshole,"I'm 19 and my friends and I decided to have a big get-together at my place. I invited a bunch of people, including my close friend, Sarah, who has been struggling with her mental health lately. I know she's been feeling really down, so I wanted to cheer her up. 

The night of the party, I was having a great time and everyone was really enjoying themselves. However, I noticed that Sarah seemed a bit off. She was sitting alone in a corner, scrolling on her phone, and not really engaging with anyone. Instead of checking on her or inviting her to join us, I thought it would be better to just let her be and not pressure her.

At some point, I decided to take a group photo to capture the fun. I called everyone over and when Sarah didn't get up, I jokingly said, “Come on, Sarah, stop being a sad sack! Just smile for a picture!” Everyone laughed, but I could see Sarah’s face drop. She eventually got up and joined us for the photo, but she looked really uncomfortable.

After the party, Sarah texted me saying that my comment hurt her feelings and that she wished I had been more supportive. I thought it was just a light-hearted joke and that I was trying to get her to have fun, but now I’m wondering if I was actually being insensitive. Was I wrong to call her out in front of everyone like that?",309,1784,0.53,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_14922,2023-09-25 00:00:00,YTA,1304,AITA
