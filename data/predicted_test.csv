15798,Not the A-hole,"My wife is 37 weeks pregnant, we are the first of our family generation to have kids so it's been a big deal and everyone is super excited.

My mother doesn't have a lot of money and she has started making comments about ""getting the baby's room ready"".  I asked her to elaborate and she says ""For my GRANDSON to sleep over OF COURSE!"".

She lives over 2 hours away, has 2 very large dogs she cannot control, and has an.....""agriculture"" business in her basement that smells the entire house.

I told her ""Save your money because that's not going to happen"".  She thinks I'm joking at first but when she sees I'm serious she start freaking out.

From her perspective, she has waited 30 years for a grandchild and since my sister can't have kids she fuels all of her excitement into us.  She has a fear of driving so her visits to us will be limited in the first place.  She is taking her excitement over the top. Her friends threw her a grandma shower for fucks sake.

I told her that I will not be driving 5-10 hours per weekend so he can sleep over in a place where there are untrained massive dogs(they are sweeties but i don't want to take the chance with a 250lb st Bernard and a 150lb Newfoundland that like to jump), and an offensive smell that permeates the house.

She responds saying she has thought of all that and will be taking the train, segregating the dogs, and installing a massive air purifier in the room.  I still tell her no with the logic of ""I don't want my child being 2.5 hours away from me, I'm not comfortable with taking a baby on a train, we are trying to avoid formula, and even with the dogs being in another room and an air purifier where he would sleep I am not comfortable with the arrangement.  I told her we can visit once in a while, but not until he's a little bit older and it's unlikely we will be sleeping over(her home smells, is small and very uncomfortable).

My mother cries like she has just lost a child.  I call my sister and ask her for help(she lives a lot closer and has a much closer relationship), and she thinks I am being unreasonable.  Apparently, my mother has already gotten the room ready and has been saving up for this huge air purifier/ozone generator thing and talked through it with my sister because she knows I'm a hard-ass.

EDIT:  Clarification... My mother isn't a cold or bad-hearted person.  I guess when I was a baby my mom dumped me at my grandmothers every weekend, so she always thought this was a norm.  I am glad she is excited but I feel things like a grandma shower is a bit narcissistic.  I would never discourage her from spending time with our son.  When I said ""Never going to happen"" I meant as a baby, staying at her place alone.  Obviously when he's older it's a different story if shes still willing to be accommodating.  She is more than welcome to come over and spend time with him whenever she likes.",719,3830,0.96,AITA for telling my mother that my future son will never be allowed at her house?,b3t71s,2019-03-21 17:16:38,NTA,2890,AITA
18240,Asshole,"My brother in law is staying with us right now and was conferencing into his usual NA meeting from the living room (our only home computer is a wired desktop in the living room.) 

We usually clear out to give him privacy, but in this case I forgot my phone somewhere in there and had to quickly go looking for it. 

I happened to go in right in the middle of someone I recognized as my coworker sharing their struggle with drug abuse and strong concerns about a potential relapse. 

We work in a job in which human lives are indirectly at stake and to be compromised at any point during work is unquestionably a risk. We have once yearly drug testing and once in a while we have random drug testing but it’s been years since I’ve been asked to do a random one. 

I’ve been really broken up about whether I should say anything though, because of course, NA is supposed to be private and confidential. And he hasn’t relapsed, he’s just concerned he might. 

I’m so broken up over this but I can’t talk to many people about it without raising suspicion about who it might be which would be worse than just quietly reporting it to the appropriate person. 

I don’t know what will happen if I report him. It might be more frequent random drug tests. Maybe they’ll fire him. I don’t know. It’s a terrible time to lose your job, the guy is working a program, and hasn’t actually relapsed. We all have vices and problems. 

But I also know I would never forgive myself if he were to relapse and screw up his work in a way that risks innocent people who trust us.

I said ""i'm 5'11, and you're almost shorter then me"", and he got pissed. He had offered to buy me a drink,but just took it when the bartender brought it, and left me there.

So I got pissed, since he was cute, and things were going well I thought, and went over to my friends. instead of backing me up they defended HIM and said ""you never fuck with a mans's height"", and that I was being rude.

1086,No A-holes here,"I was raised very, very, Protestant. One condition that's very endemic to this community is vaginismus, which is a condition that basically makes vaginal sex difficult to impossible. It's medically proven that this is heavily caused by religion. For various reasons, I thought I'd avoided this as I was able to use tampons and insert a finger when needed. Unfortunately, I have not. 

The treatments for this take a lot of time and money that I don't really have. I haven't been able to make much of any progress because I would have to do it daily and I've already spent almost $300 on this. I also need to have regular physical therapy that I don't have the time or money to do. It's brutal and I have so much hatred for the people that did this to me. I cry basically every day. While I currently have a boyfriend who is at least pretending to be understanding, as the months wear on he's definitely going to leave me because it's not realistic to be with someone you can't really have sex with. 

I can never get married, because it's not like I can play ignorant about this. I feel like I have to be open and willing to do fetish things that make me feel weird as a ""consolation prize"". My INTRODUCTION to sex is things that most people don't do until years into a sex life.

14767,Not the A-hole,"Ok so, back story is that I was 23 and unmarried when i had my daughter and I am 27 now. My mother is in her late 60's. When I told her I was pregnant, she responded by saying, ""I thought you were more conscientiousness than that."" She was definitely disappointed and not afraid to show it. I have a good job and pay rent and utilities at me and my mom's apartment. I have a good relationship with my daughter's dad even though we are no longer together. 

Yet my mother has always acted distant when it comes to my daughter. She loves her, of course, and spends at least a day a week with her depending on mine and my ex's schedule. But she has refused to establish what my daughter should call her! My daughter has ended up calling her ""Mom"" because she would hear me call my mother that and everything else I suggested was immediately shut down or got an eye roll. She started to call her that as soon as she could talk. My daughter calls me Mommy or Mama.

It is now getting to the point where my daughter will ask me,""Mama, are you my mom?"". It makes me feel horrible that we have confused her and of course I explain that, yes, I am her mom and that Mom is only called ""Mom"" because she is my mother. I have had several conversations with my mother to try to address this as I find it very immature that she will not accept any other name. I suggested that my daughter just call her by her first name if Grandma is so offensive and she bawked at that too. 

It came to a head last night when my ex was over and corrected my daughter every time she was calling my mother ""Mom"" and instructed her to call her Grandmom (his mother is Grammy or Grandma, so this works to distinguish them and doesn't confuse her). It really upsets him that this is an issue and I see where he is coming from. She responded to him by muttering under her breath, ""So, I see this is a problem."" She then rolled her eyes, got up and went to her room to bed (skipping dinner).

 At first, it didn't bother me enough to argue about the fact that she refuses to be called Grandma, Grandmom or the like, but as my daughter gets older and she still doesn't budge, it is starting to feel like she is trying to invalidate or undermine my role as the only mother in my daughter's life. It's either that or a severe complex about her age...? I feel like if it bothers her so much, why can't she tell my daughter what to call her? She has to steal my name? It baffles me because my daughter is wonderful and I know my mother agrees with me. Shouldn't she be proud to be her Grandmother? Am I an asshole for pressuring her to conform?

3328,Everyone Sucks,"My wife use to be flirty with an ex coworker, calling each other handsome / pretty, occasionally she would send him a cute photo of herself (non -nude), and they chatted quite a bit via text while not at work, sometimes about some pretty personal stuff. I noticed on her phone text message were being deleted quite often throughout their conversations, there were missing texts. At first she said she just deletes texts, she does it with everybody, the texts were just being friendly and than eventually we had a real talk and she admitted what she was doing was flirting. She had been deleting texts that would ""piss you off"" if I read them.

22078,Not the A-hole,"I'm currently doing an online crafts course in the evenings because we are all WFH now so I don't have the commute. 

My friend wanted to go with me and she did for a couple of sessions but now her husband is at home in the evenings and obviously wants to spend time with him.

The thing is, she wants me to switch to Saturday morning classes instead. I don't want to because I like to have a lie in on Saturday mornings and also I've made friends with some of the other people in the weekdays and I look forward to seeing them. The weekday classes are a lot smaller so it feels more intimate and the instructor struggles less to show us stuff on Zoom.

I told my friend that I was going to stick to weekday classes and she got upset with me because this was something we were supposed to do together. I pointed out that she was the one that made the change but she doesn't see why it's such a big deal for me to wake up on Saturday. But I have a Friday night Dungeons and Dragons campaign that doesn't finish until 3am so I don't get up until 12pm. But my friend says I would still get 6 hours of sleep. I don't only want 6 hours on Saturday though.

She's now making veiled remarks on my Work In Progress pics I post on my social media because she doesn't want to to do the Saturday morning sessions by herself. But if I can make friends and play D&D with strangers then surely she can too if she really wanted to.

But she is making me feel guilty and petty for not being more flexible since we're all stuck at home.

7882,Not the A-hole,"My sister and I went to town around 10pm to get some takeaway food. We flat together while living away from home. On the way she saw some of her girlfriends clubbing and said she wanted to grab a drink for them while I got our dinner, which I had no issue with.

After getting our dinner and txting her I’m outside she asks if I can wait 30 minutes as they’re doing shots. I refuse as our food is getting cold, so she txts me: “ok just come pick me up after you eat and put mine in the fridge.”

I reply “I’m not coming back a second time” but don’t get a reply, so I drive home.

Apparently my sister got too drunk and ended up passing out in an alley way with one of her friends.

8986,No A-holes here,"I just moved into a newish neighborhood where the homes on the south side of the street have been built for about three years and the homes on the north side are just being built now. The HOA has painted the curbs on the south side red to help alleviate parking concerns as there are loads of townhomes on the next street over with limited parking. We just built a house on the north side of the street.

My neighbor (let's call him Kevin) across the street (south side) has been parking on the curb where my new house is (north side) ever since he moved in three years ago. I'm not quite sure why. He has a two car garage and a driveway (meaning he could potentially park four cars on his property). He only has two cars. 

Anyway, the first week we moved in he continued to park right in front of our house, which we thought a bit odd. He has four parking spots on his property and two cars. To me it seems a bit rude to park in front of someone else's house when you are perfectly capable of parking on your own property. So finally the other night I had enough and went and knocked on his door. I asked him if he could stop parking his car in front of my house and he asked why. I said something to the effect of, ""I just built a brand new house and I'm not that stoked about having someone else's car parked in front of my house every single night, if I'm being as candid as I can be"". He went on and on about how everyone in the neighborhood has to deal with cars in front of their house and that my request is unreasonable (to which I responded by looking up and down our street where his car was the only car parked on the street). He seemed pretty incredulous about my request and even asked, ""so what am i supposed to do?"". Before I could respond ""well, you have a driveway"", he said he would move his car and ""figure out what he was gonna do"".

Ever since then he's been parking in front of my next door neighbor's house (still being built), making a point to keep his car as close to my property line as possible. Am I the asshole here? I'm not asking him to never park in front of my house. Obviously that's unreasonable as he or his guests can't park alongside his curb (due to it being painted red) if he's having a party or for other extenuating circumstances.

15171,Not the A-hole,"
Backstory- First, I come from a place where engagements are fairly short, so about 5 months or less normally. Second, my brother, my sister, and I are all engaged. My brother is getting married at the end of April, and my sister is getting married the week following. I’m getting married in May.
After my sister gets married she is going to X country with her husband who’s doing summer sales.
 
When FH and I got engaged, we told our parents which day we were planning on. FILs said that was fine for them and are excited. My mom was willing to work around her schedule and travel across the world, and my dad and step-mom (SM) said, “if you’re sure, then we’ll plan for that day”.  
SM said that she and dad wanted to pay for the reception venue, part of the photos, decorations, flowers, and the reception food. I told them that I would be happy having the reception in our church, which would be free, and that FH and I could pay for other things and be thrifty to cut down on costs (I don’t want anything over the top; a wedding doesnt have to be expensive for it to be nice). SM said that they were doing it for the other kids, so they were going to do it for me too. She booked the venue. 
 
Fast forward 2 weeks to when I book the church for the ceremony. I texted everyone to tell them what time and day I had booked it for, which was the agreed upon day in May. I didn’t get much response from SM and Dad except for an “ok”. 9 hours after I had sent the first text, I get a text asking me if I could change our wedding day. 
SM told me she wasn’t sure Dad could get the days off (he had already said he would), so I texted him to confirm that he would be able to get our wedding day off. He said of course, I told SM who then said “you didn’t consult with us on the date, and we have two other weddings in April plus a grad in June. You should move the wedding back to June because it would be better for us. Since you didn’t consult with us, your sister can’t be at the wedding. If you move your wedding she’d be there.” I told SM that we had consulted with them, and that if they were going to struggle with the costs of the wedding, we would move to the FREE church, and we would pay for the decorations ourselves, and FILs were ok with paying for flowers and reception food. She refused. 
SM said that it was unfair to our extended family who HAVE /s to buy gifts for us because all our weddings are close together. Most of the things on our registry are around $20 or less with a few bigger things around $50. 
 
In the end we decided not to change our date, and that has caused tension between my parents and us. I’m curious as to whether IATA in this situation or not, because I think about it a lot. Thanks.

My boyfriend and I live in a 1 bedroom/1 bathroom apartment in a major city. For the past week, his brother has been staying with us on vacation - meaning he’s been sitting at home drinking all day/watching tv while we work during the week. I love his brother a ton, don’t get me wrong. He’s really a great kid. We just both work extremely stressful jobs and when I come home, I like having my privacy and being able to relax. Right now, I can barely move around due to a king size air mattress in the living room, clothes and things everywhere, and empty beer cans/food all over the place.

Yesterday, I told my bf that if his brother is just planning on staying a day or two, it is absolutely fine for him to stay with us. I also said that if he is planning on staying for awhile that it may be better for him to stay with us for a bit and then stay with a friend who lives in the same city or perhaps get a hotel room. We literally barely have the space for the two of us to live comfortably in this apartment.

I work in an admissions office, and my coworker “Andy” recently got a new boyfriend. We are not close, but I congratulated him and moved on with my day. During lunch break, I was part of a larger group conversation, and one of my other coworkers asked Andy for details.

I was shocked when he pulled up a picture of my ex-husband. I blurted something out, and everyone else basically went silent. I explained to Andy that I had been married to Sam, and that he was a serial cheater and had abused painkillers in the past (also true). I ended with saying, “...but if you want to fuck up your life, go ahead and date Sam.”

Fast forward to Thursday. Andy apparently complained about my “homophobia” to HR, and I explained the situation to our rep via email.

I move in and I’m happy, but two of my window’s screw cranks for opening up are broken. Now the condo documents clearly state that windows and the main door are the responsibility of the building, not the owner. So I go down to the front desk and the manager gives me a price sheet and says it’ll be about $150/window. When I mention that the documents say the building is responsible, he says to email the association president with the reference and see what happens.

&#x200B;

Jordan and I have been friends since we were sophomores in college, and we are in our mid 20s now.  I'll admit that Jordan lacks a lot of experience because he gets anxious about social situations.  He's lost a lot of his friends because he will only be engaged in a convo when he wants to gripe about his work, family life, how girls don't like him, or himself.  I really feel that I'm one of the few friends he has left, as some of our mutual friends told me that they were tired of him being so negative all the time.  I've been there to listen to him talk out his problems, because despite all of it, I think he is a well-intentioned person.

&#x200B;

There are a few things that have bothered me lately.  I had a pretty emotional break up a couple months ago, and I confided in him about it because he said he felt something felt off with me.  I didn't go into too much detail about it; I just said that I was heartbroken that I liked the guy a lot but it wasn't meant to be.  He left my message on read and never responded.  I came to realize this is what he does often.  It seems that he will blow me off if I confided him in anything that I was going through.  If he does respond, it'll be with empty responses like ""oh"" or ""I'm sorry"".  I guess I always chalked it up to the fact he doesn't have much life experience.

&#x200B;

I also do cam girl stuff occasionally as a source of side income.  He knows about this because I sometimes will post teaser pics on a gonewild-offshoot sub.   I was upfront about it with him when he asked if it was me.  Now, I really couldn't care less that he's seen me nude, or even if he followed my private blog (he doesn't).  I don't post too often, but he will always text me within *minutes* after I do to compliment the way I look.  Again, the compliment itself doesn't bother me, nor the fact that it's coming from him.  I think it's just the dynamic of our friendship that's getting to me.

The last time I spoke to him was last week after I posted something, to which he complimented after not speaking to me at all for 3 weeks.  I lost my patience and said something to the effect of ""Are you seriously going to only talk either when you want to \[vent\] about something or when I post?  Some kind of friendship this has been.""  He responded with, ""Ha, I don't know, just take the compliment I guess.""  I basically told him that enough is enough, that I hope he gets some help because it's beyond me at this point, and to not talk to me again until he sorts himself out.

3493,Not the A-hole," 

My little brother is 11, we have two PS4s in the same room, our internet is pretty crappy that if someone uses their phone in the room, it would occasionally make the online games we play lag. Also if someone ever was downloading/updating something in the house, it would make everyone lag.

My little brother was playing fortnite and he was lagging a lot, when I went to check my PS4 I was updating RDR2 which is one of my favourite games. It said it approximately took about 10 mins but my little brother wants me to stop it instantly, I said no, because it only took 10 mins and also he could play an offline game. He has frequently updated games when I'm playing an online game so I switch to offline games. When things don't turn to his favour he would tell my parents and there is a 99% chance that they will be on his side since he was the one who was complaining first and he did that, but this time my parents weren't on his side and when that happens, he starts crying about it. It's annoying when he doesn't have any independence to deal with situations like this, he could have easily played an offline game but he didn't. After the update finished he was very salty at me, he likes to hold grudges when those kind of situations happen like this.

18334,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 months. Past few months have been rough, because he's been making really uncalled for comments about me, my body, what I wear, etc.

The first incident happened three months ago.  He told me that he hates the way I dress because I look like a ""slob.""  I have a grunge-like style, but I've had that style since before he even asked me to be his girlfriend.  I still shower every day and I still keep up with my hygiene.  I told him that what he said was really hurtful, especially considering the fact that I've dressed that way our entire relationship, and he tried to tell me that I dressed more ""revealing"" and ""showed off feminine features"" more.  I know that's not true, I remember how I dressed back before we started seeing each other, and it was exactly the same.  He even tried to tell me that I messed with the dates on my phone to make it look like I was right when I showed him pictures of me from before we were together, then proceeded to call me sad and said I was just unwilling to admit that I was wrong.

Fast forward to about a week later.  He looked at me while I was in my bra, and he said ""You look anorexic.  Are you even eating babe?"" I told him I literally eat more than he does and that I'm naturally underweight no matter what I do to attempt to gain weight.  He then told me that he knows I'm lying even though whenever we go out to eat I get way more food than he does and he barely even finishes his.  I asked him why my weight was such a big deal and his reply wasn't ""It's because I care about your health.""  It was straight up just ""Because I don't want to fuck a skeleton.""  I went home without a word after he made that comment and he gave me some half assed apology that was basically ""I'm sorry I said that BUT you looked unhealthy and I was genuinely worried about you."" I told him that it was OK but I was secretly angry with the way he ""apologized"" because it felt like he was still trying to make himself sound better even after he blatantly revealed his intentions when it came to calling me ""anorexic"" at the house and they weren't because he thought I was unhealthy.

Today, he told me that I ate too much at restaurants before and that it made him look bad.  I was baffled by what he said and so I said ""But wait... didn't you tell me two months ago that I ate too little and looked like a skeleton?"" He first said ""No I never fucking said that"" and when I pulled up screenshots he conveniently remembered and said ""Oh yeah that time you overreacted and left because I said I was worried about you."" I said that he NEVER told me he was worried about me until after I left and he just flat out called me a liar.

4049,Asshole,"This obviously happened a LONG time ago.

The Teletubbies were very popular at my high school (yes seriously), especially amongst kids that did drugs (for obvious reasons.) I remember once my teacher said we could just watch TV for the rest of class because she didn't have anything else to talk about that class and guess what show was playing that everyone asked to watch? Teletubbies.

My sister meanwhile who was 7 about this time hated it when I was watching Teletubbies at home because it was the ""cool"" show. She thought they were creepy and scary.

Anyone one summer day she was kind of annoying me while I was watching TV before her bedtime so during a commercial I went to her room and came back quick. I told her I heard the Teletubbies giggling so I looked under her bed and they were hiding there.

She freaked out and told my parents. They kept telling her that the Teletubbies don't exist in real life so they can't be under her bed but she refused to listen. So she ended up sleeping in their bed that night and the next few days. Needless to say they weren't happy with me. I thought it was silly she was so afraid of a show for literal babies, it'd be like being afraid of Barney or Sesame Street.

15324,Not the A-hole,"Best friend and I (both early 30s) have been basically brothers for 20+ years, and him and his wife were together for seven years and married for four. This last year he got a new job which made him very conceited and would go out every weekend with his new workmates who are all...quite misogynistic. I definitely noticed changes in the way he would treat people and pulled away a bit. 

Three months ago he showed up at my place in tears saying he made a big mistake and his wife was leaving him because she found a thong under the bed that wasn’t hers and an email between him the workmates joking about hiring hookers. He swears up and down that he never cheated on her and never would and he was so devastated I had to believe him. His wife left him in the middle of the day without saying a word, just divorce papers and no one knows where she left to. 

He was so broken and spent a lot of time talking to us about it, I know he really loved her and was totally blindsided but the situation also looked so bad from her end. We did our best to comfort and be there for him. A few weeks after all this, he stopped hanging out with us as much and started hanging out with his work friends a lot more. His attitude did a total 180, he wasn’t sad and moping around anymore but cocky. He got on this kick about how she probably elaborately set him up to leave him for another guy and pin all the blame on him because he got his friend to watch her at her work and she was eating her lunch with a guy. He suddenly started dating this new girl - my wife and I were pretty surprised but trying to be supportive asked him about her and he said, verbatim ‘she’s a butterface but always down to bone’. The new girlfriend started posting about them on Instagram in his hot tub that ex wife got him as a wedding gift with a caption that said ‘my hot tub, my man, my house now’ with the laugh emoji. Of course this got back to ex wife and she went absolutely psycho on him, telling him things so terrible I can’t include them in the post, trying to screw him as much as possible in the divorce and selling the hot tub in the middle of the day while he was at work. 

Since this he’s been terrified of running into her and he’s convinced she’s going to mess with all his stuff or him or his girlfriend. He’s been begging me and my wife to let him stay with us for a few months while he tries to find a new place. We have a guest room but honestly don’t want him there. My wife is in a VERY stressful masters program and I want her to have as little stress as possible right now. She is getting really sick of him because he doesn’t take any of our advice. I want to help him because he seems like he’s headed down a dark path and needs me but I also would lose my mind if he lived here.

Last night I really wanted to go out to dinner rather than cook, but it was fairly late and we wouldn't have made it to the casual dining restaurant until half an hour *before* their closing time.  My girlfriend insisted that by the time we finished it would be at least forty five minutes after closing and that we were being rude to the restaurant staff who just want to go home on time.  My position was that we'd hardly be the only ones the staff was waiting on and that they have no real expectation of going home at closing time anyway - most restaurant staff are going to be on shift for an hour or two after the customers leave cleaning up and tearing down.  We had a mild fight about it and ended up ordering pizza.

So Am I the Asshole?  I always tip 20%+ (U.S.) and try to tip in cash when possible as I'm aware of the prevailing wage laws for wait staff.

We have 2 kids together (6F and 3M). My son's pregnancy was very tough on us. She was on bed rest because of very high blood pressure. I was a complete asshole to her and cheated on her with my now wife (28F). 

&#x200B;

She found out and immediately applied for divorce, which was the wake up call for me I guess. She was a stay at home mom and does not have much of family. She got full custody and I got visitation for weekends. She has never asked for more than the court approved childcare and started working at a private firm for part time when my parents looked after my son. They love her as much as my sister.

&#x200B;

Because of Corona, my ex-wife has been laid off her job but she and the kids seemed okay. My ex-wife's one guilty pleasure is this Italian chocolate wafers she love. Strangely, my daughter also loves this. I always have 1 when I have my kids. 2 months ago, my daughter asked me if she can take the rest to her mom so her mom can have some. I then found out from my sister that her savings had been running low, so she is cutting all the extras for a while but still make sure the kids have it.

&#x200B;

I talked to her and she wouldn't accept money. I brought her grocery and snacks and she told me to please stop it.  I told her to use our kids emergency fund, but she thanked me and said not to worry about it. I told her what our daughter said and they are feeling bad, so for our daughter's sake I told her I am going to pay her 1K more in child care until she finds her feet and she accepted.

&#x200B;

I thought nothing about it but my wife has lost her mind. How my ex is manipulative, and dragged my entire family into it.

You probably think I'm paranoid but I'm sure she has an agenda. One time I walked in on them working and she looked me right in the eye then put her hand on his leg. I calmly mentioned all of this once she left but he thinks I'm over thinking things.

21054,Not the A-hole,"I started a job at a video production studio a few years ago. It is a small business owned by 3 brothers, with only me and one other person working for them. My main job has been recording and broadcasting meetings for our clients as well as working with some local businesses to shoot and edit their commercials. My bosses are entrepreneurs and own multiple businesses, but until recently I was never asked to work on anything for them.

It started earlier this year. They wanted a new website for one of their businesses and asked if I had any web development experience. I have none whatsoever, but they still asked me to make the website anyway. During this time, I was still going on shoots, but all the footage would go to my coworker for the actual edit, with my bosses saying “they want me focused on the website.”

During lockdown, all of our clients cancelled their upcoming shoots. While working from home, I was doing busy work still related to video. But a month in, they told me they were going to open a seafood market. They wanted me to make the website for it that can be used as an online store. I again told them I don’t have the experience. They said that with no clients, this was the only way they could keep paying me to work. So I worked on a basic website. During daily phone calls, I would always ask if there were any upcoming shoots and was always told no.

When my state opened back up, they wanted everyone back in the office. My coworker told me of the multiple shoots that he had done throughout the lockdown. When I confronted my bosses about it, they told me they wanted me to focus on making the website.

When the office reopened, the seafood business opened. All of my clients have been given to my coworker. I can’t do video work unless he begs them to let me help. Since the website is done and they can manage it, I do nothing at the office. They keep telling me that I can pick up extra hours by working the store and I overheard them talking about how they don’t want to hire anyone new.

Last week, my coworker took a vacation day, and one of my old clients needed something fixed immediately. My bosses and I were making more space in the garage to expand the business, and I told them that the client needed me to work with them. In response, my boss flipped out on me saying, “Jesus fucking Christ. Anything to get out of work?” and proceeded to ball up and throw green screens at my face, storming off calling me a bitch for “trying to get out of work.” When I talked to HR (his brother), I was told “Nothing we can do about it.” I told them all afterward that I do not work for the seafood business and am here for video related work, much to their annoyance.

So now my days have been sitting at my desk as my bosses work on the new business pissed at me and my coworker is forced to do the job of 2 people by himself because they refuse to put me to work.

I apologized and said I couldn't do that (the real reason is that we aren't close and the few times a year I see her she acts all annoying about my tattoos and piercings) but my mum talked me into it so I agreed she could stay for a month.

About my house. I normally live alone and the house is pretty messy. Nothing like hoarders but dishes piled up in the sink, toilet and shower don't get cleaned that often, stuff gets left out. Kinda gross but whatever it's my damn house and I don't really mind the mess. When talking to my aunt I explained this and she seemed to not really care.

Now she's been here for a few days and already she's been a bit of a nuisance. Generally kind of nosy and criticizing things about my house and how I dress (like shit, but again, its my house and if i want to look ""trashy"" or not wear a bra then I will). When she does I just kinda say ""oh yep"" and disengage from her.

Today she knocked on my door and asked when I was going to clean the place as it's a ""pigsty"". I said I wasn't planning on it. She didn't really like that and started listing off all the stuff wrong with my house so I just said ""ok"" and closed the door and went back to what I was doing. Later I went out of my room to fix dinner and she left the guest room to start hovering over me in the kitchen and pointing out all the messes that I don't care about. I was getting real pissed by this point and said ""look you're staying here as a guest and you're not paying rent or anything to me. I'm only letting you stay here because my mum doesn't want you to struggle so if you don't like the mess either clean it yourself or move out.""

She backed off after that but later that night I got a text from my mum imploring me to be more patient since aunt's going through a rough time.

I literally can’t ride my bike to the grocery store (which is very close to my house) for non spending purposes without hearing her bitch about it. 

She told me explicitly that the card was for getting food if I’m with my friends or whatever. She wont let me use it online, and there’s not much else to spend my money on short of being able to drive to places and get a ticket to a movie or whatever.

I never agreed to her putting it towards “savings.” 1/2 my work money goes towards it, but it’s not in a bank, not for post-college; she just insists on saving the money for “bigger purchases”

My daughter is very sweet, and quiet she had never been in trouble before. Now I think her kind nature has the tendency to make her a target for a bully. This girl had been picking on my daughter for years on and off, as well as lots of the girls. I tried so many times contacting her teachers, principal, her mom, school counselors. Everytime it just fell on deaf ears. I know I wasn’t the only parent who tried and tried. There were multiple family’s who were fed up.

A couple of months ago she made out with another guy while sober multiple times, and hid it from me but eventually other people told me about it. We broke up but she was apologetic and remorseful, so I decided to give her another chance and try to move on.

Last night she mentioned going out with her friends and drinking. I told her how I was not comfortable with this given how we are still working on rebuilding trust in our relationship, and that l'm fine with you going out and having fun but getting drunk and going to parties where that guy you hooked up with will be there too will make me feel upset. I didn't want to give her an ultimatum so told her to do whatever she wants, but getting drunk and going out before we've fully worked through our issues and I have 100% trust with her would just work against all the progress we have made.

She said that she does not want a controlling boyfriend telling her what to do, and that she knows she is not going to hook up with anyone if she gets drunk so she should be able to do whatever she wants. She said that if I respected her I would be fine with her making these decisions and doing what she wanted. She did say I could go out with her if she wanted, but I have a lot of work so stayed in.

Ultimately she did get drunk and go out, I did feel weird about it and kept thinking what if she is with him again. I am upset with her, but not sure if my feelings are justified or if I am in the wrong here. So reddit, AITA?

15541,Not the A-hole,"Backstory:
My mom died in 2012. My dad went completely off the deep end and got into drugs and alcohol. I was out of the house by then, but he and my younger sister got evicted from our apartment. My 15 year old sister (we'll call her Ashley) had nowhere to go. She stayed with one of her best friends (Kelly) for about 5 months.

I grew up babysitting Kelly but after she hit her teen years I barely saw her. I heard a few stories about drugs, stealing, not being able to hold down a job for more than a few months, etc. You know, typical teenage drama.

Here we are today: Ashley and Kelly are both in their early twenties. Ashley lives with her boyfriend, a roommate, and another guy is crashing on her couch. (An entirely different issue, dude is freeloading and won't leave). I am almost 30, and live in a 3 bedroom apartment with my fiance, my now sober and disabled) father, and 4 cats.

Ashley calls me up and says Kelly has an emergency situation at home. She needs a place to stay. Can she crash with me for 2 or 3 MONTHS while she tries to find another place to live? Oh, and she wants to bring her unfixed, unvaccinated cat.

My 3rd bedroom is basically storage space, a futon, and three giant litter boxes. I told Ashley that Kelly is welcome to couch surf or stay a few nights on the futon if it's really an emergency, but I wasn't comfortable with an undisclosed amount of time without some kind of game plan.

After half an hour of bickering the likes of which we hadn't done since I was in high school, she tells me she can't believe how selfish I was and she was ""SO disappointed in me as a sister"". 

Not 15 minutes later my dad walks into my bedroom with the other tactic - guilt. Kelly would be willing to pay for the room. Kelly's family took Ashley in when he was fucked up, Kelly should be like family to us, it's the ""Christian"" thing to do, why can't I show a little compassion, etc.

I told him he didnt understand the psychological and financial burden I'd be under, the legality of it, not to mention the stress and anxiety. Introducing another cat into my horde would bring a plethora of new issues. He left after telling me he was concerned about my immortal soul for being so callous.

21534,Asshole,"So I’m sure this is a very petty post. But it’s been upsetting me all day so here we go...


Earlier today I was minding my own business watching the first episode of a new Netflix show when my sister comes downstairs unannounced and just sort of hands me an amazon package addressed to me. I was a little confused because I wasn’t expecting any amazon packages, and my birthday was over a month ago so I wasn’t really expecting anything related to that either, so I ask her if she knows what it is and she just sort of shrugs it off. 

I open it up and it’s a bunch of music books for the new instrument I just got. Which on the surface is a really nice gift. But I wasn’t particularly excited, more confused. Not many people knew I had this instrument and my sister said she didn’t know what it was, so my assumption was perhaps it came from my mother. However we’re not on good terms and it would be very like her to try and bribe me with a gift like this so one of my first thoughts was that I may not keep this gift. I was pretty into my show so I quickly rifled through the box and then leaned back in my chair to return to my show acting pretty indifferent I’m sure. 

I thought my sister was watching the show with me so when she asked me, “that’s it??” I thought she was referring to something on the show. I start explaining but she says “no I mean the box, that’s it?” I passively tell her it’s some sheet music because I didn’t think it would interest her and I was going to figure it out later. But then she got upset and walked off telling me she got it for me and there was a note I didn’t notice. 

It was a nice note that said happy belated and thanks for all you do, but by the time I was reading it my sister was shouting from the stairs, “so should I just return it? There are more still to arrive should I cancel them since you hate your gift?” So her attitude kind of negated the gratefulness one might feel from getting a gift. I told her I didn’t get what she was talking about and didn’t want to deal with this at the moment. 

Then I overheard her talking to my mother loudly complaining about me. When I hear her say “he’s not worth talking to” I sort of lose my cool. So this is where I may be TA, I took the amazon package upstairs and slid it as hard as I could along the floor until it slid against the door of the room they were speaking in. 

I mean who gives a gift and then immediately gets upset and threatens to return it like that?? It felt like somehow me getting a really confusing gift turned me into the bad guy while she went and told everyone what a victim she was.


Edit: just a few clarifiers

The package was essentially a few books in a box, no damage to the items themselves were intended nor suffered. The act of sliding the package along the floor was an angry way for me to say ‘I hear you’ and absolutely was passive aggressive. 

Also the note in question was a tiny slip of paper that looked just like the receipt. So I didn’t acknowledge it when taking initial stock of the package because I was intending to put it aside until I wasn’t preoccupied by a tv show.

I told them ""you might want to cut that out! Llamas spit in self-defense."" But they kind of laughed my warning off.

Now, I knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. But I decided not to tell them about that. I figured if they persisted, I'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.

The llama was being patient. At one point it gave them a ""warning spit"" (just saliva) and they went ""eww"" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.

Finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. It got the girl square in the face. She dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. Her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that I was in.

To make things worse for them, I didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! It was a slow day, so I just locked the doors. I told them I didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.

17753,not the a-hole,"My wife and I have been together for over 10 years, but for the last few our relationship has been suffering. I'm afraid we don't have very much in common anymore (as far as interests and activities, wants, etc.), and it has been partly the cause of some friction.

What I'm coming to realize now is that she is incredibly controlling and stubborn, and I am afraid she may be gas-lighting me without actually meaning to.

As our arguments got worse, ""we"" decided it would be a good idea for me to go see a therapist. You see, after arguing for a few hours and feeling completely unheard or acknowledged, while being interrupted constantly, I would explode, get loud, and say hurtful things. So I went to a therapist in order to work on those ""scary anger issues"". I'd like to say that these ""hurtful things"" were bottled up criticisms from our past, i.e. ""You constantly interrupt me"", ""you have hypocritical double-standards"", etc.

After going to see her for a year, my therapist says that my wife should be in therapy. Granted, she had only heard from me, but god that was validating. Shortly thereafter the therapist goes on maternity leave. I noticed that the therapy wasnt helping me very much, and in fact was making me more upset because all I would do is complain about my wife, then get tools (that didnt work) to help with the arguments; so when she came back from maternity leave I discontinued seeing her.

Fast forward some time and now I'm just getting depressed and anxious pretty often. I start having panic attacks on my way home, thinking about having to deal with her, ""what if shes in a bad mood, etc."" And so, I decided to get on zoloft to see if that would help (and it really has).

Now it is a lot easier for me to let things go, and we don't argue nearly as much. However, we do still of course have our occasional spates, and I still feel REALLY bad after, even though I don't really blow up anymore.

So then, I started recording our arguments without her knowledge. I legitimately wanted to re-listen when I get to a calmer place, and see what I can do better going forward. And while there are a lot of things I can work on, I'm starting to think of these recordings as proof that I am actually not crazy.

8332,Asshole,"My wife and I are both south african, she’s black and I am white. We met during Apartheid and we’ve been in love ever since; we got married as soon as it became legal in 1985. We have two children together and while we have had ups and downs, our marriage has been a happy one.

From the moment our relationship came to be, we both were criticised for having a “immoral relationship”; her family didn’t want her to be with the oppressor and my family didn’t want me to be with “lower people”. This caused our relationship to be very strong and stable. As we became used to insults and whispers around us. 

When Mandela ran for office, we both voted for him, I thought that things were finally going to change, that “races” were going to be a thing of the past, and they were for a while. But soon enough my wife was being seen as a “traitor”, and so was I, and why? For the same reasons I previously mentioned; marrying someone of another colour. We are now used to this and now don’t care for it, but in recent years our children (ages 13 and 9) have been insulted relentlessly for being “coloured”. We put them in a black majority school first, were they bullied for having a white father and being “afrikaner dogs” and then we put them in a white majority school hoping for the best, but the process repeated itself. In the end we put them in a french school, which is mixed. But my eldest kid still gets insulted and my smallest doesn’t really have any friends because no one wants to play with the “half-breed”. 

Due to all of this, I’ve come to the conclusion that it can only be good if we move to a country like the UK or Australia, where mixed-race communities are now a normal and accepted thing. However, when I told my wife about this, she said that I had no right to remove my kids from their country and that it would hurt our family in many ways. I tried to explain to her that this was the only way our children could grow up normally without any sort of prejudice against them. But she wouldn’t have it, she isn’t talking to me and is staying at her parents house with our children. I now feel really bad and have to ask myself, am I the asshole here?

This happened when me and a friend of mine were at mall's food court. There was a new Shawarma outlet that had opened and of course i wanted to try it out. I went to the stall, gave my order and paid the salesperson the money and waited in front of the stall till my order was ready. I expected the lady to slice off chunks off the rotisserie and wrap it. Instead, she went inside her pantry and brought out some chunks of chicken and heated them in the microwave. I was obviously pissed. I went to stall and asked her Wtf she is doing and said that I wanted fresh Shawarma off the rotisserie and not whatever she brought from the pantry!

Following were her reasons for not giving me freshly cut pieces:

It's not economical for them for turn the rotisserie on and off every time they get an order so they do it just twice a day

That's how they usually do it

Nobody has ever complained about this (it's a relatively new shop)

All of the above was rubbish and I wanted my money's worth so I kicked up a fuss and asked to either return my money or give me a fresh fucking piece of chicken.

For some background, I am 23f in my first year of grad school and doing a paid internship in my field. In February a sub-con (Richard) came in and literally charmed the pants off me (I mean literally). He's 15 years older and basically hit all my buttons. Within a week of meeting him he took me on a trip to Hawaii (it was a business trip for him), he bought me an insane amount of gifts and I was between living situations he set me up in a nice hotel for a month hotel with all expenses paid (also had to do with his business) and I was on cloud nine. He paid for damage deposit and first month's rent on my new apartment 

What was really happening is I was a moron and blinded to the glaring fucking red flags that he gave me. He would disappear without contact for days and up to a week at a time, the only number he gave me was a google voice number. He could only sleep over on Tuesdays and I never saw where he lived and he lied about not having social media. I never even thought to check. 

Maybe 2 weeks ago a friend and I went to the movies. I saw Richard and what turned out to be his gorgeous wife and even more gorgeous two kids. I was stunned and wanted to faint. He absolutely saw me but I apparently am so easily manipulated by him he essentially told me with his eyes ""be cool and don't make a scene"" and I didn't. I left and have been crying my eyes out essentially non stop for the last two weeks, for me and for his family. I never wanted to be this person but here I am. 

I finally looked him up on facebook and sure enough that was his family, he posted ""happy"" pictures at his kids swim meets and on dates with his wife while I was in the hotel room he was paying for. The level of deception is insane. 

I know I have to tell his wife, but would I be a raging asshole if, as opposed to just saying ""I'm so sorry, I had an affair with your husband,"" I basically laid out a list of everything he did for me; the trips, the gifts, the hotels and on and on? 

Or is that too much and I need to allow her the space to process the information and extent of his affair in her own time?

15928,Not the A-hole,"Had a family dinner this past weekend. It included myself, my fiance, my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents. My sister got divorced maybe a year ago and has a boyfriend. I really like him, he's great. And they are so great together! I'm happy that she is finally happy. I've known my fiance for 10 years and have been 'together' for 6 or 7 years. Things are great with us, too.

At dinner, we were talking about old memories and laughing. Generally having a good time all around. We eventually talked about how much dating has changed over the years and now the majority of people meet online/through an app. I should mention here that my sister met her boyfriend on a dating app. Nothing wrong with that, it is 2019. Then my sister brought up my ex because I had met my ex online but before all these apps were status quo (12+ years ago).

Back then, I got sooo much shit from my family about how I met my ex. They all were less than nice to me and to him and it's something I've never forgotten. That relationship lasted 2.5 years but eventually we broke up but for other reasons. When I look back, I do have the 'what the hell was I thinking' reaction that everyone has when they think about their exes but I also have a bit of sadness and anger towards my family about how I was treated. So obviously, I don't like going back there. My sister just kept talking about my ex and how unsafe meeting people online was back then and I'm so lucky he didn't end up being a sexual predator or serial killer! She and my parents were talking about my ex and how horrible he was while myself, my fiance, and her BF just stayed quiet. Honestly, my ex was a nice guy, just not for me, so I took offense to what was being said as I was also being painted as being foolish.

I'm not proud of what I did but I loudly said something like ""Ahhh, this must be the portion of the family dinner where we all talk about our past relationships! Does anyone else want to talk about their exes? Dad, how about your exwife from when you got married at 20? Mom, anyone? BF and fiance... do you want to talk about any of your exes? Sister, how about we talk about your exHusband or exBF? I heard exhusband is finally selling the house.""

I mentioned that I thought it was wildly inappropriate at all to bring up anyone's ex while everyone's significant other is sitting right there. There was an argument. Fiance and I excused ourselves and we went home.

I have possession of a high chair that my father made for my oldest sibling. It was used with all of us, most recently my youngest sibling who passed away less then a year ago extremely unexpectedly. 

Two years ago when my father moved he asked me if I wanted it, as he was downsizing and didn’t want to store/move it. I was very excited to get it and have toted it around for two years hoping I would have the opportunity. It needs a little fixing and my husband is going to repair it for our child to use. 

My stepmom has two children that are older then all of my siblings. One of those children have a second child, a year old that is coming along with their parents to visit them for a week this summer. I don’t know them, met them a couple times about 10 years ago and haven’t spoken to them since.  There’s no animosity on my part, or theirs that I know of, but the majority of the time they’ve been in my life they were drug addicts in and out of jail, and moved states to get away from their habits. There never really was opportunity to get to know them.

My dad has asked for me to bring him the high chair so he can repair it and let this baby use it. I plain don’t want to. He asked in the same conversation that he told me he had found photos of him building the chair, but couldn’t find any of me or my siblings in it. I believe he wants a photo of a baby in it to add to their photo wall, which I feel the need to add that while it includes my late sibling, does not include my other sibling or myself. Just my stepmothers children and grandchildren.

Our table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.

Got home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.

10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).

10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm

11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.

It was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...

She came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...

Is this an asshole move or just stupidity?

Not sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever

5762,Not the A-hole,"(On mobile, sorry for the awful formatting) 

For context. I loaned my older brother $100 for gas money to get back and forth to job interviews and groceries when he was unemployed last year in February saying he could pay me back when he got a job. To make things clear, I didnt ever pester him about it and was very understanding about his mountains of debt he had. Just asked about it every once in awhile. 

Well it's been a while and hes been working at this job for about a year now, I poked him a few times about paying me back, he continuously said he couldn't, or tried to trade me his broken down truck in compensation a few times (which I couldn't drive) or trade the $100 for that in his girlfriend's dispensary's weed (which I dont smoke, and been told it's bad and overpriced anywas even if I did)

 After denying those as trade he ghosted me for about six months and ignored me when I brought it up. Well the other day I sent him a message on Facebook and said he could do a payment plan for the money and again he flat out ignored me again. I'm getting frustrated and hes screwed other people over too, I dont want to be one of them. 

So reddit. Would I be the asshole if I started adding interest onto his borrowed money until he pays me back? I have a limited budget and the $100 would be nice to have back now that's hes working and financially stable enough to spend hundreds on weed and alchohol every month.

Edit: thanks guys for the advice, not going to charge him interest for something he wont pay me back for, learned my lesson and am going to move on knowing never to loan him money again.",44,31,0.86,WIBTA: if I started charging my brother interest for borrowing $100 from me a year ago and not paying it back.,ctki10,2019-08-21 18:01:13,NTA,1618,WIBTA
6162,Asshole,"A minor thing, but one that apparently not everyone agrees with me about.

I work at a hospital, and the bathrooms there are single stall, unisex bathrooms. They lock from the inside. I noticed a long time ago that the custom seems to be that a person approaching the bathroom will knock on the door, wait for a response from inside, and then try the handle if they get not response. Presumably the person in the toilet is supposed to say “occupied” or somesuch in response to the knock. 

This horrifies me. I’m not talking to some random while I’m sitting on the commode. It feels like a minor, but unappreciated, invasion of my privacy. Instead of knocking, I think they should just go straight for the handle. Clearly if the door is locked, the bathroom is occupied. No response required. 

I personally never knock. I just go for the handle. Some of my coworkers think that’s inconsiderate, because somebody might have forgotten to lock the door. I have never once walked in on anybody, but I bet if I did, they’d remember to lock it next time.  

So, AITA for going straight for that handle?
