Everyone sucks here,"I've been living in my apartment for a few years now, and I usually get along well with my neighbors. However, a new family moved in next door about three months ago, and things have been tense ever since. They have a toddler who is very loud, and they often let him run around outside screaming at all hours, which has disrupted my work-from-home routine.

One night, after a particularly long day of trying to concentrate with all the noise, I snapped. I went outside and yelled at them to keep it down. I felt bad, but I was just so overwhelmed and tired. They responded defensively, saying they were just letting their child play and that I should be more understanding.

A few days later, I decided to try to smooth things over. I bought a few toys and left them at their door with a note saying I understood how hard it could be to keep a toddler entertained and that I hoped this would help. I thought it was a nice gesture, but they took it the wrong way. They thought I was patronizing them and didn’t appreciate my interference in how they parented.

Now, there's even more tension between us. They’ve been quieter, but I can tell they’re still upset, and I feel guilty for yelling at them. At the same time, I feel like they could be more considerate about the noise. I don't know what to do—should I apologize for the yelling or just let it go? Everyone seems to be on edge in this situation.",231,1942,0.54,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_77007,2020-08-03 00:00:00,ESH,1404,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Last week, I was over at my friend Sarah's house for a small gathering. During the evening, we started playing some party games, which included a truth or dare round. Things were lighthearted until it was my turn to either tell a truth or take a dare. I chose dare, and someone dared me to prank call our friend Jake, who wasn’t at the party.

I thought it would be funny and harmless, so I did it. I called Jake and pretended to be someone from a company, telling him he had won a huge prize but needed to pay a small processing fee to claim it. Jake, being gullible, started to believe me and got really excited. I felt a little bad, but everyone else was laughing, and I didn’t want to back out.

Eventually, Jake caught on and got angry. He hung up on me and came over to confront me about it. He said I crossed the line and that it wasn’t funny at all, and I tried to explain that it was just a joke, but he was really upset. I ended up apologizing, but I still felt like I was just trying to have a good time with friends.

Later, Sarah pulled me aside and told me that I should have known better than to prank someone who might take it seriously. She said it was immature of me to think it would be harmless, and I felt like she was judging me unfairly. 

In the end, I think we all could have handled the situation better. I shouldn’t have done the prank call, but Jake also could have taken it less personally and realized it was meant to be a joke. So, AITA?",995,2232,0.84,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_34055,2020-08-06 00:00:00,ESH,1468,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Title: AITA for yelling at my neighbor's kids?

I live in a quiet neighborhood, and I really value peace and quiet, especially after a long day at work. My neighbor has two kids who love to play outside, which is great, but they always seem to choose the late afternoon when I'm trying to relax or take a nap. 

Last week, they were playing tag and laughing loudly right outside my window while I was trying to unwind. I could hear them screaming and running around, and it really got on my nerves. I ended up opening my window and yelling at them to keep it down, saying they were being too loud and should go play somewhere else. 

The kids looked shocked, and I could see their parents in the yard nearby, who quickly came over and scolded me for yelling at their kids. I felt bad afterward, but I was really frustrated.

Everyone sucks here,"I (28F) have a younger sister, Emily (24F), who has always been a bit of a free spirit. She recently got involved with a guy who’s quite a few years older than her and has a pretty questionable reputation. I’ve met him, and while he seems charismatic, I worry he’s not the right fit for her. I’ve seen how he can manipulate conversations and get people to do what he wants, and I don’t want her to get hurt.

A couple of weeks ago, Emily invited me to a gathering at their place, and I reluctantly went. I didn’t want to alienate her, but I had my guard up. During the night, I overheard him talking down to her in a condescending way when he thought no one was listening. It was really disturbing. I could see she was embarrassed but didn’t say anything back.

So, I decided to confront him about his behavior when we were alone. I told him I didn’t appreciate how he was speaking to my sister and that he needed to treat her with respect. He got defensive and started to argue, claiming I was just jealous and trying to control her life. It turned into a heated exchange, and I ended up saying some pretty harsh things about him that I didn't really mean. I was just angry and worried about Emily.

Later, Emily found out about the confrontation and was furious with me. She said it was her choice to be with him, and I should have kept my opinions to myself. I felt bad for the way I handled it and apologized, but I also think she deserves to know the truth about how he treats her. Now we’re not speaking, and I feel like I betrayed her trust, while also feeling justified in my concerns.

Everyone sucks here,"I’m feeling really conflicted about what happened the other day, and I need some outside perspective.

So, to give you some context: I (28F) was at a friend’s birthday party, and it was a pretty relaxed get-together with a small group of friends. My friend Lisa (30F) has a great sense of humor, but sometimes she goes a bit too far with her jokes. She’s always been the type to make fun of people’s quirks and flaws, and while most of us find it funny, not everyone handles it the same way.

At one point during the party, Lisa started making jokes about our friend Mark (31M), who has a stutter. I could tell that Mark was getting uncomfortable, and while I appreciate humor, I felt like this crossed a line. I tried to redirect the conversation by bringing up a different topic, but Lisa just kept going, saying things like, “Come on, it’s just a joke!” and “Lighten up, everyone stutters sometimes.”

Eventually, I snapped and told Lisa to stop being an insensitive jerk. I was frustrated because I didn’t want to see Mark hurt. Lisa got really defensive and said I was ruining the party with my “PC nonsense.” Things escalated, and I ended up yelling at her about how she was being a bully. It got super awkward, and a few other friends sided with me, but some defended Lisa, saying she was just joking.

After the party, I felt guilty for losing my temper, but I also think Lisa needs to be more considerate. Mark texted me later, thanking me for standing up for him, but I still feel like I overreacted. Did I go too far?

Everyone sucks here,"My best friend and I have been inseparable since childhood. We’ve shared everything, from our dreams to our struggles. Recently, she started dating this guy who I honestly don’t think is right for her. He’s charming, but he has a history of being manipulative and has treated her poorly in the past. I’ve expressed my concerns to her multiple times, but she brushes them off, insisting he’s changed.

One night, we were all out at a bar, and during a conversation, I made a comment that wasn’t very nice about him. I said something like, “Can you really trust someone who treats you like that?” I thought I was just being honest and looking out for her, but it turned into a huge argument. She was upset and accused me of sabotaging her relationship, while I felt like I was just trying to protect her.

In the heat of the moment, she called me a “toxic friend” and I snapped back, saying that if she wanted to date someone who disrespects her, that’s her choice, but I wouldn’t support it. After that, she walked away from me, and we haven’t spoken since.

I feel bad for how things escalated and that I was harsh, but I also believe I had my friend’s best interests at heart.

Everyone sucks here,"My (30F) friend Amy (29F) invited me to her housewarming party last weekend. She put a lot of effort into decorating her new place and wanted to celebrate with friends. I was really looking forward to it, but I had a long week at work and was feeling exhausted. 

When I arrived, I noticed that the atmosphere was lively, and Amy had prepared a lot of food and drinks. However, I was feeling off and just wanted to relax. During the party, I ended up sitting on the couch scrolling through my phone while everyone else was mingling and having a good time. I thought maybe I’d perk up after a bit, but it didn’t happen.

After a while, Amy approached me and asked if I was okay. I told her I was just tired and didn’t feel like socializing much. She seemed a bit disappointed, saying she wanted everyone to have a great time and that it was her special day. I felt bad for bringing down the mood, but I didn’t know how to snap out of it.

Later, when I overheard her telling another friend that my behavior was ruining the vibe, I felt hurt and defensive. So, I decided to leave the party early without saying goodbye. I texted her later to apologize, explaining that I was feeling overwhelmed, but I sensed she was still upset.

Everyone sucks here,"Title: AITA for being upset that my sister is dating my ex?

My sister, who is 24, started dating my ex-boyfriend, who I was with for about three years before we broke up six months ago. We ended things on good terms, and while we both moved on, I definitely didn’t expect my sister to go for him. 

When I found out they were dating, I felt a mix of emotions. I was angry at first but mostly felt betrayed. I talked to my sister about it, expressing how uncomfortable I was with the situation and how it felt like a violation of our bond. She dismissed my feelings, saying she didn’t think it was a big deal since we had broken up and that she couldn’t help who she fell for.

I ended up getting annoyed and kind of made a scene at a family gathering where both my sister and my ex were present. I brought up how awkward it was for me, and I might have made a few hurtful comments about their relationship. I realize now that I probably should have handled my feelings better and not aired my grievances in front of everyone.

On the other hand, I feel like my sister also crossed a line by dating someone I was seriously involved with, and it feels like she didn’t consider my feelings at all. I’m torn because I don’t think either of us handled the situation well, but I still feel like she should have respected my feelings more.

Everyone sucks here,"So, my sister has been dating this guy for about a year now. We all thought he was a decent guy at first, but I started noticing some red flags. He can be controlling and dismissive, especially when it comes to her friendships and interests. I brought my concerns up to my sister a few times, but she always brushed them off, claiming I was just being overprotective.

Recently, I learned that her boyfriend has been making snide comments about her appearance and belittling her ambitions, and it upset me to see her so unhappy. One night, I overheard them having an argument where he called her “too sensitive” and accused her of being “ungrateful” for not appreciating the things he does for her. It broke my heart to hear her defend him and say that she deserved it for being “too emotional.”

I reached a breaking point and decided to confront him directly. I sent him a message on social media, outlining all the ways I felt he was treating her poorly, and told him that if he didn’t change his behavior, I would feel obligated to tell her about my concerns. I thought I was standing up for my sister and looking out for her best interests.

When my sister found out, she was furious. She said I overstepped and that she can handle her own relationship. She even accused me of trying to control her life. I feel torn because I genuinely care about her well-being, but I also see her point. I guess I should have just let her figure it out on her own.

Everyone sucks here,"Throwaway account, my partner uses Reddit.

So, I (F) have been living with my partner (M) for about two years now, and we recently decided to combine our finances. We both have different spending habits—he tends to be more frugal, while I enjoy treating myself to nice things occasionally. I’ve always been responsible with my finances, but I also believe in enjoying life a little.

A few weeks ago, I bought myself a new laptop. Mine was getting old, and it was a model I had been eyeing for ages. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but when my partner found out, he exploded. He accused me of being irresponsible and said that I was ruining our financial plans. I was taken aback because I hadn’t expected such a strong reaction. I tried to explain my thought process and assure him that I had saved for it, but he wouldn’t listen.

Things escalated, and during the argument, I brought up how he spends a lot on gadgets and tech that I think are unnecessary. That definitely didn’t help the situation and led to a back-and-forth where we were both saying hurtful things. 

After the fight, I felt guilty about how we handled it. I realize now that I could have communicated my thoughts better and been more respectful of his feelings. But at the same time, I think he was too harsh given the context of my purchase.

Now we’re both feeling upset, and the tension is still in the air. I’m wondering if we were both wrong here. AITA for buying the laptop, or is he overreacting?

He’s very open about it, which I respect, but sometimes I feel like he uses it as an excuse for his behavior. Recently, we were in a team meeting when Mark was particularly quiet, and I noticed he was scrolling on his phone instead of participating. 

After the meeting, I mentioned to him that it would be great to have him engage more, especially since he has great insights. He snapped back at me, saying it’s hard for him to focus when he's feeling overwhelmed. I said I understood that, but it felt unfair to the rest of the team when he doesn't contribute.

He got really upset and accused me of not being supportive, claiming that I just don’t understand what he goes through. I tried to explain that I do care about his mental health, but it’s also important for us to work as a team and support each other, which means everyone needs to participate.

Later, I told another coworker about the interaction, and they said I should have been more sensitive to Mark’s feelings.

Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I have been living together for about two years now. We both work full-time jobs, and neither of us particularly enjoys cooking. I cook maybe two or three times a week, and when I do, it’s usually something quick and simple like pasta or tacos. My partner often comes home later than I do, and it’s not uncommon for them to be left to fend for themselves for dinner on those nights.

Recently, my partner brought up that they feel frustrated about having to make their own dinner so often, especially after long workdays. I can understand that, but the problem is that they also have some pretty specific food preferences that make it difficult for me to cook for both of us without a lot of extra effort. They don’t like vegetables, and they want everything to be gluten-free and dairy-free. I’ve tried making meals that fit their preferences, but they often complain that it either takes too long or isn’t what they wanted.

In response to their frustrations, I suggested that they could meal prep on weekends or even just cook some simple things for themselves when they get home late. They got upset and said that it shouldn’t be solely my responsibility to cook, and that they also deserve to have a nice meal after a long day. I kind of snapped back and told them that it’s not fair to expect me to cook for them when they have such specific tastes. I think we both just got frustrated and ended up arguing about it.

Now, I feel guilty for how I handled the situation, and I can see their point about wanting to feel cared for and not just like an afterthought when it comes to dinner. But at the same time, I think it’s unreasonable for them to expect me to cook elaborate meals every night when we both have busy schedules.

Everyone sucks here,"Hello, throwaway because I don't want my friends to find this.

I'm (27F) currently living with my best friend Sarah (26F) and her boyfriend Mike (28M) while I save up for my own place. We've been living together for about two months now, and while I genuinely love them both, things have gotten a bit tense.

From the start, Mike has made some offhand comments that I found a little uncomfortable. For example, if Sarah and I are having a girls' night and laughing, he’ll often interrupt with jokes like, “What are you two gossiping about? Should I be worried?” or “Don’t make me come in there and join your little sleepover.” I brushed it off as him just being playful, but it kept happening, and it began to feel like he was trying to undermine my friendship with Sarah.

Last week, we were all watching a movie together, and at one point, Sarah leaned over to whisper something funny to me. Mike, who was sitting across from us, said, “Careful, ladies! Don’t get too cozy or I might have to break up this love fest!” I felt really annoyed and said, “You know, you don't have to make everything weird. Just let us enjoy our time together.” He sort of laughed it off, but it was clear he didn’t appreciate my tone.

Later, Mike confronted me about my comment. He said I was being too sensitive and that he was just trying to lighten the mood. I snapped back that maybe if he actually respected our friendship, he wouldn’t feel the need to make those comments. This escalated into a heated discussion where Sarah ended up defending him and saying I was overreacting. I told them both that their dynamic felt really condescending towards me, and I was just tired of it.

Now, I feel guilty for how I reacted, especially because I don’t want to create tension in our living situation. But I also think Mike needs to be more mindful of how his jokes come off. Sarah feels stuck in the middle and has told me I should apologize to Mike for the way I spoke to him, but I also feel like I shouldn’t have to tolerate his comments.

So, AITA for confronting Mike about his jokes? 

Edit: I realize that I might have been too harsh, and I do understand that he might not have intended to hurt my feelings, but it just seems like a classic case of “just joking” that crosses a line for me.",527,2507,0.77,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_23567,2018-08-02 00:00:00,ESH,2280,AITA

I work at a local coffee shop, and we often have a pretty diverse clientele. Last week, a couple came in, and they seemed to be having a great time together, laughing and joking as they ordered. I was serving them, and when they got their drinks, I casually commented, ""You two look like you're having a blast! It's great to see such a cute couple."" 

Now, I thought it was a harmless compliment, but the woman suddenly looked taken aback and her partner's face went red. I quickly realized I might have misread the situation. The guy snapped at me and said something along the lines of, ""Why do you assume we're a couple? That's really inappropriate."" 

I was taken aback as I didn’t mean to assume anything; they just looked happy together, and I thought they were a couple. The atmosphere got tense really quickly. I tried to apologize, saying I didn’t mean to offend, but the guy wouldn’t let it go and started calling me disrespectful. The woman looked uncomfortable, and I felt bad for putting her in that position.

After they left, I talked to my coworker about it, and he said I should've known better than to assume they were a couple based on their demeanor.

As I was picking up the dishes, I noticed my roommate’s plate had moldy food on it.

My roommate retaliated by saying that I was overreacting and being controlling about cleanliness, and that it wasn’t a big deal to have a little mess.

In the heat of the moment, I ended up tossing their moldy plate in the trash without asking them first. I thought it was better to get rid of it since it was clearly not salvageable. That made things even worse — my roommate got furious and said I had no right to throw away their stuff without permission.

As the night went on, one of my friends, Jake, started getting a bit loud and obnoxious. He was making jokes at everyone’s expense and was just generally over the top. At first, it was funny, but soon it became uncomfortable, especially when he started targeting one of our friends, Sarah, who’s a bit more sensitive. He kept mocking her for losing a game and made some comments about her gaming skills that were outright mean.

I tried to lighten the mood by joking back at him, but it didn’t really help. At one point, I snapped and yelled, “Jake, chill out!

I agreed, but I also felt that some of her expectations were a bit unrealistic, especially since we were still settling in.

Recently, my partner and I decided to have a small gathering with a few friends. We cleaned up the house thoroughly and made sure to follow all of my sister's rules. However, we were having a good time, and I didn't notice that one friend accidentally spilled some wine on the carpet. It was a small amount, and I thought I could clean it up quickly before my sister found out.

Unfortunately, my sister came home early and saw the spill. She was furious and started yelling at me in front of my friends. I felt embarrassed and tried to explain that it was an accident, but she wouldn’t listen. I ended up snapping back at her, telling her that it was just a carpet and that we were trying our best to keep the place nice. This only escalated her anger, and she started calling me irresponsible and disrespectful.

In the heat of the moment, I told her that she was being overdramatic and that maybe she should lighten up a bit. My friends were awkwardly standing by, and I felt bad for putting them in that situation. After she left, I realized that I should have handled it differently and tried to calm her down instead of arguing back. My partner also told me that I shouldn’t have snapped at her like that and that it just made the situation worse.

Now, my sister is upset with both of us, and I feel like we all overreacted. I wish I had found a better way to address the issue without escalating things, and I know my sister could have been more understanding too. I just wanted to enjoy a fun night with friends, and now I'm left feeling guilty for the way everything turned out.",93,1701,0.56,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_22910,2021-09-30 00:00:00,ESH,1985,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Some context: I’m a college student and I share an apartment with two roommates. We all have different schedules, which is fine, but it can get chaotic sometimes.

Last week, I was studying late at night for an important exam, and I decided to make some pasta in the kitchen. My roommates were out, and I figured I wouldn’t be too loud. However, I’ve always had a habit of listening to music while cooking—it keeps me motivated. So, I turned up my portable speaker and started jamming away.

About halfway through cooking, my roommate Anna came home unexpectedly. She walked into the kitchen and immediately told me to turn off the music because she was trying to study. I was caught off guard and honestly a little annoyed. I told her that I was in the middle of cooking and that it wasn’t that loud, but she insisted it was disruptive.

Instead of just compromising, I snapped back at her and said she could find another place to study if she couldn’t handle a little noise. Instead of de-escalating, we ended up arguing. I told her she was being unreasonable for expecting silence at 9 PM in a shared apartment, and she called me inconsiderate for not thinking about her needs. 

We both ended up yelling at each other, and I felt bad afterward. I didn’t want to ruin our roommate dynamic, but I also thought she overreacted. A few days later, I overheard her venting to our other roommate about how I was the worst for not respecting her study time. I felt hurt, and maybe a bit embarrassed.

TLDR: I was cooking and listening to music when my roommate asked me to turn it down. I argued with her and ended up making things worse, and now it feels tense between us.",430,2499,0.8,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_75846,2020-12-03 00:00:00,ESH,1669,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Last week, I had a disagreement with my roommate about how we handle our shared living space. We’ve been living together for about a year, and while we generally get along, this issue has been simmering for a while. 

It started when I noticed that my roommate had begun leaving dirty dishes in the sink for days at a time. I’m not a neat freak, but I do believe in maintaining a clean environment, especially when it’s shared. I asked him to please clean up after himself, and he got defensive, saying he’s been really busy with work and didn’t have time to do chores right now. 

Instead of just letting it go, I decided to address it more firmly. I told him that I understood he was busy, but it wasn’t fair for me to have to clean up after him constantly. In hindsight, I could have been more diplomatic about it, but I was frustrated and raised my voice.

He responded by saying that if I was going to act like the “clean police,” then maybe he should just leave his stuff out even longer to make a point. We both ended up escalating the argument, exchanging some hurtful comments about each other’s habits and lifestyles.

After a couple of days of tension, we finally had a calmer conversation where we both apologized for how we reacted but we still couldn’t come to a real solution for the chore problem. I’ve been trying to keep my cool and just do my part, but I still feel a bit resentful about having to pick up after him.

So, while I think I was justified in wanting a clean space, I also recognize that I didn’t handle the situation well, and my roommate could have been more responsible too.

Recently, Jake got a promotion at work and decided to throw a celebration party. I was excited for him and wanted to contribute, so I offered to bring snacks and drinks.

The day of the party arrived, and I put together a nice spread of snacks, including some of Jake's favorites. When I got to the party, I noticed Sarah brought an extravagant cake and some fancy appetizers that made my contribution look pretty lame in comparison. As the night went on, Jake kept gushing over Sarah's food, and I started to feel overshadowed.

I admit I let my jealousy get the better of me. When people complimented Sarah on her cake, I jokingly said, “Well, at least my snacks didn’t cost an arm and a leg!” It was meant to be lighthearted, but Sarah’s face fell, and she responded, “Not everyone can just throw money at a party, you know.” It turned into a small argument where I ended up saying that she was just trying to one-up me, and she snapped back that I was being petty.

Later, Jake tried to mediate, but I couldn’t help but feel like he was taking her side. I ended up leaving the party early, feeling hurt about both their reactions. I know I shouldn’t have made a dig at Sarah, but I also think she overreacted to a harmless joke. We all ended up texting each other the next day, but it felt tense.

Sarah ended up storming out, and Mike was visibly upset. He started crying and venting to me about how stressed he was and how he felt like he couldn’t do anything right in their relationship. I listened and tried to offer some comfort, but then he asked me if I could give him a free drink to help take the edge off. 

Normally, I wouldn’t do that, but in that moment, I felt bad for him. So, I made him a drink and didn’t charge him for it. A few minutes later, Sarah came back in, clearly still angry. She saw Mike with the drink and immediately started accusing me of enabling his drinking and called me a bad influence. 

In the heat of the moment, I snapped back and told her that she should calm down and stop blaming me for their problems. It was a low blow, and I shouldn’t have said that, but I was frustrated.

Everyone sucks here,"So a little backstory:

I recently hosted a small get-together at my apartment with a few friends, including my best friend, Jake, who has a tendency to get a little rowdy after a few drinks. We were having a great time, playing games and chatting, when Jake decided to bring up a sensitive topic: my girlfriend, Lisa’s, recent job loss. 

I understood it was a mistake as soon as he said it. Lisa had been feeling really down about her job situation, and I thought it was unfair for Jake to bring it up in front of everyone. I told Jake to drop it, but he kept pushing, joking that maybe she should just become a professional napper or something equally insensitive. 

Lisa, understandably upset, excused herself and went into the bathroom to calm down. I was furious with Jake and let him have it, calling him thoughtless and a jerk for bringing it up. 

In my anger, I may have raised my voice more than necessary, and some of the others in the room felt uncomfortable. One friend even suggested that I was being too hard on Jake, saying he was just trying to lighten the mood. 

When Lisa came back, she seemed a bit better, but the atmosphere was tense. I tried to apologize to her for what had happened, but she was still upset and said she needed some space. Eventually, the night ended awkwardly, with several friends leaving earlier than planned. 

I later texted Jake, telling him that he needed to be more mindful of what he says. He replied that he was just joking and didn’t mean any harm, which made me even more frustrated.

For the final question: AITA for getting upset with Jake for making those comments and for raising my voice, even if I was trying to defend Lisa?",826,2104,0.54,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_38678,2024-07-21 00:00:00,ESH,1685,AITA

My parents constantly praised him and compared me to him, which really bothered me. I’ve always felt like I was living in his shadow.

Recently, my brother got a great internship opportunity, and my parents celebrated by throwing a big dinner party to honor him. They invited family and friends and made a big deal out of it. I was happy for him, but the constant focus on how amazing he is made me feel even worse about myself. I mentioned to my parents that I wanted to pursue a summer program related to my interests, but they brushed it off, saying it wasn’t as important as my brother’s internship.

During the dinner, my parents asked me to say a few words to celebrate my brother. I was already feeling resentful, so I made a sarcastic comment about how maybe one day I’ll be as great as him. The room went silent, and my brother shot me a look that could kill. I could see that he was hurt, but I was tired of feeling overlooked.

After the party, my brother confronted me about my comment. He said I was being petty and that I should be happy for him instead of trying to undermine his achievements. I snapped and told him that he wouldn’t understand what it’s like to be in my position, always second best. We ended up arguing, and I said some hurtful things about how my parents only care about him and not about me.

Everyone sucks here,"So, here’s my story. I (28M) recently had a fallout with my best friend (29M), and honestly, I think we both messed up.

We’ve been friends for over a decade, and I’ve always been there for him through thick and thin. He’s been struggling with his mental health for a while, and I’ve tried my best to support him, but it’s been challenging. A few months ago, he started dating someone new, and he seemed happier, but I also noticed he was spending less time with me.

Last week, I invited him to hang out, and he said he couldn’t because he was going to a party with his new girlfriend and her friends. I felt a bit hurt, but I understand that new relationships can be consuming. I jokingly said, “Guess I’m getting replaced by your new girlfriend, huh?” He laughed it off, but I could tell it bothered him.

Later that evening, I saw him post pictures from the party, and it stirred up some jealousy and frustration in me. I know it’s irrational, but I felt like I was losing my best friend. So, I sent him a message saying, “Looks like you’re too busy to hang out with your real friends now. Must be nice to have a new toy to play with.”

He responded angrily, saying I was being childish and selfish. I didn’t back down and told him that he was abandoning his friends for someone he barely knew. That made him even angrier, and he said he didn’t need my negativity and that I should be happy for him instead of acting like a jealous ex.

In retrospect, I can see that I was being petty and insecure, and he was just trying to enjoy his life. But I also think he could have made more of an effort to include me, especially since I’ve been there for him through tough times. We ended up in a big argument, and neither of us reached out to apologize afterward.

Looking back, I realize we both acted poorly. I shouldn’t have lashed out, but he also didn’t consider my feelings during this transition. So, AITA for saying what I did, or is he also at fault for not being a better friend?",248,1260,0.64,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_13181,2024-09-11 00:00:00,ESH,1986,AITA

He’s controlling, and I’ve seen him treat her poorly on a few occasions. I expressed my concerns to her, and she got really defensive, insisting that I was just jealous and didn’t want her to be happy.

Things escalated when she invited me to a gathering at her place, and I decided to confront her about the relationship again, trying to make her see the red flags. She ended up getting really upset and kicked me out of her house. I felt horrible and didn’t want to lose our friendship, but I also believed I was looking out for her well-being.

After that, I tried to reach out a couple of times, but she wouldn’t respond. I was pretty hurt and frustrated, so I made a post on social media about friendships and loyalty, implying that I felt betrayed by someone who I thought was a true friend. I didn’t mention her name, but it was clear to mutual friends who I was talking about.

A few days later, Sarah confronted me about the post, saying that it was immature and that I should’ve just spoken to her directly instead of airing our issues online. I got defensive and told her that she was just trying to deflect and avoid accountability for her choices.

Now, we’re both feeling hurt and betrayed, and I’m starting to wonder if we both handled it poorly.

Everyone sucks here,"Hi,

I need some perspective on a situation that recently happened between my friend and me. So, I (30M) have a close friend, let's call him Jake (31M). We've known each other for over a decade and have always had a pretty good relationship. Recently, Jake started dating a girl, Anna (28F), who I honestly think is not a great match for him. She seems to be really self-absorbed and doesn't treat him well, constantly dismissing his feelings and making plans without consulting him.

I mentioned my concerns to Jake a few times, but he kept insisting that he was happy and that Anna was the one for him. I tried to respect his decisions, but I couldn't shake the feeling that he was making a mistake. A few weeks ago, I saw Jake at a party, and he was visibly upset because Anna had canceled their plans last minute to go out with her friends instead. I could tell he was hurt, and instead of just being there for him, I took it a step further and told him that he deserved someone who would treat him better.

In the heat of the moment, I ended up suggesting that he should break up with her and even offered to go out and meet other people together, maybe even set him up with some friends of mine who I thought would be better for him. I thought I was being a good friend, but looking back, I realize I may have pressured him too much.

Jake ended up breaking up with Anna, and while he seemed relieved at first, he also told me that he felt guilty about how things ended. He said that it felt like I was trying to manipulate him into making a decision. Now, things are awkward between us because I feel like I overstepped my bounds, and he’s still processing his feelings about the breakup.

So, I’m wondering—did I cross a line by trying to influence his relationship? Was I out of line for pushing him to end things with Anna, or is he being too sensitive? ESH?",605,2956,0.66,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_56319,2023-10-13 00:00:00,ESH,1868,AITA

However, after a few months, I started noticing some red flags. He would often make dismissive comments about Lila’s career aspirations, telling her that she should focus more on being supportive and less on her ambitions. I tried to talk to her about it, but she brushed it off. Then things escalated; he began to isolate her from friends, saying that they were a bad influence on her. I became increasingly concerned and decided to intervene.

One night, I invited Lila over for dinner and casually mentioned my worries about Tom. I shared some specific examples of his behavior and suggested that she might want to reevaluate her relationship. She got defensive and accused me of trying to break them up. I felt like I was just being a concerned friend, but clearly, I overstepped a boundary.

Recently, we decided to throw a small dinner party with a few friends. I spent the whole day prepping, cooking, and cleaning the house to make everything nice. I made a big pot of my famous chili, which I was really proud of.

When our friends arrived, Sarah had invited her co-worker, Mike, last minute without telling me. I didn’t know much about him, but she said he was fun.

I then decided to make a snarky comment to Sarah, saying, “Looks like Mike is trying to single-handedly finish my chili. Maybe I should’ve made two pots.” Sarah got defensive and said I was being rude, and that Mike was just enjoying the food.

Later, when I saw Mike heading back for a third helping, I snapped a bit and said, “You know, chili isn’t going anywhere. Maybe let everyone else have a chance to enjoy it too?” This time, he looked a bit taken aback, and Sarah shot me a glare. Our friends seemed uncomfortable, and the atmosphere got tense.

After the party, Sarah was upset with me. She said I made Mike feel unwelcome and that I should’ve handled it better. I thought I was just being funny and trying to make a point. I told her she could’ve warned me about Mike’s appetite beforehand, and we ended up arguing about it.

Mark then escalated the situation by yelling about how he had a right to peace and quiet. I told him that he could either chill out or call the cops if it was that big of a deal. I wasn’t proud of it, but in the heat of the moment, I felt justified in standing my ground. 

After that, Mark threatened to report us for noise complaints, which only made me angrier. I called him an “old man” and told him that maybe he should invest in some earplugs if he couldn't handle a little fun. I realize now that was disrespectful and uncalled for.

We’ve been living together for about a year, and while we generally get along well, there have been some tensions lately regarding chores and shared expenses. Recently, we decided to have a weekly house meeting to discuss any issues and to divide chores evenly, which was long overdue.

One day, during our scheduled meeting, we were discussing the bills when it came up that one of my roommates, Sarah, hadn’t been contributing her fair share to the grocery fund. I pointed out that it didn’t seem fair for the rest of us to keep covering for her when she was the one who munched on all the snacks and didn’t contribute financially. This escalated into a heated argument where we all shared frustrations. I got frustrated and accused her of being selfish, while she called me controlling and nitpicky.

In the heat of the moment, Sarah suggested that if I was so concerned about her eating habits, maybe I should just buy my own groceries and stop worrying about her. I was hurt by that comment and, feeling defensive, I snapped back that maybe I should just take all the food and hide it until she learned to chip in. It was a thoughtless remark, but in the moment, it felt justified.

After the meeting, Sarah was obviously upset, and the tension hung in the air for the rest of the week. I felt guilty afterward and tried to apologize to her, but she brushed me off, saying she needed time to cool down.

Then, a few days later, I noticed she had taken my favorite snack from the communal stash without asking. I confronted her about it, and she dismissed my concerns, saying I should “lighten up” and that it didn’t matter since we all lived together. I lost my cool again and ended up taking some of her personal belongings and putting them out of her reach as a way to teach her a lesson.

Looking back, I realize that I shouldn’t have escalated things with her and my reaction was immature. However, I also think Sarah could have been more responsible and considerate about our shared living situation.

Everyone sucks here,"This is a throwaway account.

Backstory - I (28F) have a close group of friends that I've known since college. We usually hang out every weekend, and it’s a mix of both guys and girls. Recently, one of my friends, Jake (29M), had a birthday, and he invited us all over for a party. The plan was to have a laid-back night with some food, drinks, and games.

A couple of days before the party, I had a small argument with my boyfriend (30M) about his habit of being late to everything. He always says he’s on his way, but he usually shows up at least 30 minutes late. I expressed my frustration, and we ended up having a bit of a heated discussion. I told him that I would be going to Jake’s party without him if he couldn’t promise to be on time. In the heat of the moment, I might've said I didn't want him around if he couldn't respect my time.

Fast forward to the night of the party, I showed up on time and was having a good time with friends. My boyfriend ended up arriving about an hour late. He walked in, and I could see that he was upset. I tried to brush it off and enjoy the evening, but he kept bringing up how I was ""embarrassing him"" by being there without him and how I had no right to tell him he wasn't welcome.

At some point during the night, I mentioned to Jake that I was thinking of going home early because I didn't want to deal with my boyfriend’s attitude. Jake jokingly said that I should just break up with him since I seemed unhappy. I laughed and said maybe he was right. My boyfriend overheard this and got even angrier, saying I shouldn’t joke about our relationship in front of friends.

When I pointed out that he was the one making it awkward, he snapped back and said I was being dramatic. We ended up leaving the party early because the tension was too much for both of us. Now I feel kind of stuck. I understand that I might have escalated things with my comments, but I also think my boyfriend needs to learn to show up on time and not take everything so personally.

Everyone sucks here,"This is a throwaway account because I don't want this connected to my main profile.

So, I (29F) have a really close-knit group of friends that I've known since college. We have a tradition of going on a weekend trip together every summer. This year, we decided to go camping in a national park. Everyone was excited, and I was especially looking forward to it because it’s a great way to reconnect after a busy year.

A week before the trip, one of my friends, let's call her Lily (28F), mentioned that she was bringing her new boyfriend, who I hadn't met yet. I was a little taken aback because we usually just have our friend group on these trips, but I didn’t say anything. I figured it would be fine.

When the weekend came, I was really annoyed with Lily’s boyfriend, who we’ll call Jake. He made a lot of jokes at the expense of my other friends, and he was just generally rude. He kept interrupting conversations and acting like he was the life of the party, but it felt more like he was just trying too hard. 

By the second night, I had reached my limit. We were all sitting around the campfire, and Jake made a particularly insensitive joke about one of my friends' struggles with anxiety. I snapped and told him that he needed to stop being a jerk and that he wasn’t funny. It got heated, and I ended up saying that he clearly wasn’t good enough for Lily if he thought that kind of humor was acceptable. 

Lily was furious with me for embarrassing her boyfriend in front of our friends. She ended up storming off to their tent, and I felt bad for ruining the mood. I didn’t think I was being that out of line because I genuinely felt he was crossing a line. 

Later, when we were all winding down, a couple of my friends told me I should have just let it go instead of confronting him. I thought I was standing up for my friends, but maybe I made it worse. I feel conflicted about whether I handled the situation poorly or if I was justified in calling him out.

Everyone sucks here,"My friends and I like to hang out at a local coffee shop every Saturday morning. It’s our little tradition, and we usually take up a big table in the corner. A few weeks ago, we arrived to find the place packed, and we squeezed into a smaller table. Not ideal, but we made it work.

As we were chatting and joking around, a couple at the next table started giving us dirty looks. I’m not sure if it was our laughter or just the fact that we were taking up valuable coffee shop real estate, but it was clear they were annoyed. After a while, one of them, a guy in his late twenties, leaned over and asked us to keep it down. I thought he was being overly sensitive, but I did lower my voice a bit.

A few minutes later, one of my friends made a loud joke, and I couldn’t help but burst out laughing. The guy shot us another glare, and this time I called him out, saying something like, ""If you can’t handle a little noise, maybe you should go to a library instead."" 

That’s when the woman with him chimed in, saying it wasn’t just us and that the whole place was too loud, including the baristas and the music. I snapped back that it was a coffee shop, not a funeral. We ended up having a heated argument about how places like this are meant to be social, and they could either deal with it or leave. 

By the time we left, the atmosphere was tense, and I realized that we had all escalated the situation. I felt justified for standing up for our right to enjoy ourselves, but I also know we could have been more considerate.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I (28F) have been friends with Sarah (27F) for several years now. We met in college and have always supported each other through ups and downs. Recently, Sarah started dating Jake (30M), who I had known casually before they got together. They seemed really happy, and I was supportive.

However, things got a bit complicated when I found out that Jake and I shared a mutual interest in photography. I love taking pictures as a hobby, and Jake was actually a professional photographer. We struck up a friendly conversation about photography one day and decided to collaborate on a small project together. I thought Sarah would be excited about it, and initially, she was.

But as we started working together more, I noticed that Sarah began to act distant and a bit jealous. I tried to reassure her that our partnership was strictly professional, but she seemed to be bothered by it. I thought it was just her insecurities, so I didn’t think much of it.

Last weekend, we had a photography session planned, and I ended up posting some of the photos we took on my social media. I tagged Jake and wrote a caption about how much I enjoyed the day and how talented he is. To my surprise, Sarah exploded in the comments, accusing me of trying to steal her boyfriend and making it all about me. I was taken aback but tried to explain that it was just a fun day of photography.

Things escalated when I received a message from Sarah telling me that I needed to stop hanging out with Jake and that I was being selfish. I was hurt and confused, so I vented to a couple of mutual friends about how I felt unfairly accused. They also thought Sarah was overreacting.

Well, Sarah found out that I had been talking about her to our friends, and she was furious. We ended up having a big argument where I told her she was being unreasonable, and she called me a backstabber. I felt justified in defending myself, but looking back, I realize I should have approached the situation more delicately rather than venting to others.

So now I’m stuck in this situation where both Sarah and I are hurt, and I feel like we both crossed some lines. AITA for collaborating with her boyfriend while she felt uncomfortable, or is she overreacting?",17,1960,0.62,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_68110,2022-05-06 00:00:00,ESH,2224,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I’m ready to hear what people think, but I have a feeling I might be the asshole here—or maybe not?

I (M 28) have a close group of friends I’ve known since high school. One of them, Jake (M 28), has been in a relationship with his girlfriend, Sarah (F 27), for about two years. When they first started dating, Sarah made it clear that she wasn't a fan of our friend group hanging out too much without her or that we should all be friends. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but it started to feel a bit controlling.

Recently, my friends and I planned a weekend camping trip, and it was implied that we'd have a ""guys only"" weekend since we've always had those. A few days before the trip, Jake mentioned that Sarah wanted to come along. I was caught off guard and felt frustrated since she had previously expressed that she wasn't really interested in our stuff. I told Jake I thought it might ruin the vibe and that it would be better if it was just the guys.

Jake seemed to understand, but after a lot of back and forth, he decided to bring her anyway, which made me feel like he was prioritizing her over our friendship. I ended up texting the group chat, suggesting we might just postpone the trip since I wasn't going to enjoy it with Sarah there. I thought this would get Jake to reconsider bringing her, but instead, it blew up. Jake was upset, saying I was being selfish, and that I should be more accepting of Sarah.

When we finally went camping, my mood was off, and I ended up distancing myself from the group. I was curt with Sarah and made some passive-aggressive comments, which made the atmosphere tense. At one point, Jake confronted me about my behavior and called me out for being rude to Sarah. I felt defensive, insisting I was simply trying to protect our trip, but I know I could have handled it better.

Now, I’m left questioning whether I was being a jerk for wanting our trip to be just the guys, while at the same time, I think Jake’s decision to bring Sarah was inconsiderate of our long-standing traditions.

Everyone sucks here,"My best friend Sarah and I have been close for over a decade. We’ve always supported each other through thick and thin. Recently, Sarah went through a tough breakup, and I tried my best to be there for her. I listened to her vent, offered advice, and even took her out to distract her a few times.

As she started to heal, she began to show interest in dating again. I encouraged her, wanting her to find happiness. However, I noticed that she was interested in a guy I briefly dated a few years ago, Tom. We had a short-lived relationship, and there were no hard feelings when it ended. I never thought much of it since Tom and I had moved on.

When Sarah mentioned wanting to go out with Tom, I hesitated. I liked Tom as a person, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of unease. I decided to have an honest conversation with Sarah about it. I told her I was uncomfortable with her dating him because I felt it might complicate our friendship. I explained that it was nothing personal against her or Tom, but I didn’t want any potential drama.

To my surprise, Sarah got really upset. She accused me of trying to control her love life and said I was being selfish. She insisted that if she liked him, she should pursue it, and that it was unfair for me to have a say in her decisions. I tried to explain my perspective, but the more I spoke, the angrier she got.

In the heat of the moment, I ended up saying some hurtful things, like calling her “disloyal” for wanting to date someone I had been with, even if it was years ago. I immediately regretted my words, but the damage was done. Sarah stormed off, and since then, we've barely spoken.

Now, I feel conflicted. I wanted to protect our friendship, but I also recognize that I overstepped by trying to dictate her choices. I’ve reached out to apologize, but she’s still angry.

Everyone sucks here,"Okay, here goes. This happened about a month ago. My partner and I have been together for three years, and we generally have a solid relationship. We both love cooking and trying out new recipes together, which is something we bond over a lot. Recently, we decided to host a small dinner party for some close friends, and we were both excited about it.

A few days before the party, we started planning the menu. I suggested we try a new pasta dish that I had seen online, but my partner really wanted to make a traditional family recipe that they had grown up with. I could see how passionate they were about it, and I completely respected that. However, I felt strongly about wanting to try the new dish, and I pushed a bit too hard for it, insisting that it would impress our friends more.

Eventually, my partner relented and agreed to make the pasta dish, but I could tell they were disappointed. I tried to lighten the mood by saying we could make their family recipe another time, but it didn’t really help. During the party, I was so focused on showcasing the new dish and making sure it turned out perfectly that I somewhat neglected my partner’s feelings. When our friends arrived, I bragged a bit about the new pasta recipe, and I could feel my partner withdraw a little.

At one point, one of our friends asked about the family recipe, and I made a joking comment about how we didn’t go with it this time because we were trying something ""fancier."" My partner looked visibly hurt, and I felt awful when I saw their face. After the party, they confronted me about how I had acted, saying I should have valued their family recipe more. I realized I had been so caught up in trying to impress everyone that I hurt the person I care about most.

In my defense, I apologized and explained that I didn’t mean to undermine their feelings, but my partner also admitted they could have stood their ground better instead of agreeing to switch the menu just to please me. We both ended up feeling pretty bad about the whole situation, and we’re still working through it. So, was I the asshole?",836,761,0.88,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_13831,2021-10-09 00:00:00,ESH,2094,AITA

So, I (28F) recently got into a big argument with my younger brother (22M) over something that happened at our family gathering. We were all at our parents' house for dinner, and my brother brought his new girlfriend along. 

I’m all for my brother dating, but this girl (let's call her Sarah) has a habit of being pretty rude and dismissive to others. During dinner, she made a snide comment about my career choice, saying I should ""get a real job"" because I work in the arts. It caught me off guard, and I could feel my face getting hot. Instead of letting it go, I snapped back that maybe she should learn to be more respectful if she wants to be part of the family.

My brother immediately jumped to her defense, saying I was rude and that I shouldn’t attack someone just because they have a different viewpoint. At that point, I got frustrated and told him that if he was going to defend someone who disrespects his family, maybe he should reconsider who he’s dating. We ended up having a heated argument right there at the dinner table, and it made the atmosphere really tense.

Afterward, both my parents were upset with us. My mom said I was out of line for calling out his girlfriend like that, while my brother felt that I was being unnecessarily harsh and embarrassing him in front of someone he cares about. 

In hindsight, I probably could’ve handled it better and not said what I did, but I also feel like my brother should stand up for family when someone is being rude.

I recently hosted a small gathering at my apartment with a few friends. It was a casual get-together to celebrate my birthday, and I invited around ten people. I prepared snacks, drinks, and even baked a cake. I asked everyone to bring their own drinks to help with costs, which I thought was reasonable.

One of my friends, let’s call him Mike, showed up late and seemed a bit off. He brought a six-pack, but it was cheap beer and he was visibly annoyed that I hadn’t provided a full spread of drinks. As the night went on, he started making snide comments about the snacks I prepared, saying they were “basic” and “not worth the effort.” I brushed it off, thinking he was just joking.

Later in the evening, another friend, Lisa, made a comment about how she loved the cake I baked. Mike, however, turned it into a competition and said, “Well, if you think that’s good, wait until you try my mom’s recipe.” He proceeded to talk about how much better it was and how I should’ve just asked his mom to make it. At that point, I felt really frustrated but didn’t want to ruin the mood, so I just laughed it off.

As the night wore on, I noticed Mike was drinking heavily and becoming more obnoxious. He started to criticize how I decorated my apartment, saying it was “lame” and “too basic for a birthday.” I lost my patience and told him that if he didn’t like it, he didn’t have to stay. He got defensive and said I was overreacting, and that I should lighten up.

At this point, the atmosphere grew tense. Other friends were visibly uncomfortable, and I felt embarrassed that things escalated. Eventually, Mike left, slamming the door behind him, and I spent the rest of the night apologizing to my other friends for the drama.

Now I’m feeling guilty. Maybe I shouldn’t have reacted the way I did, but I also think Mike took it too far. AITA for standing up for myself at my own birthday party?

However, on the day of the concert, one of my friends, Sarah, texted me saying she was feeling unwell and might not be able to make it. I was initially concerned about her health, but then she texted again saying she was feeling better and decided to go to the concert after all.

I picked up my other friends, and we headed to the venue. When we got there, Sarah was already waiting for us. I greeted her with a hug and we went inside. However, as the night went on, I noticed that Sarah seemed off. She wasn't engaging much with the group and was mostly on her phone. I tried to include her in conversations, but she just seemed indifferent.

At one point, I jokingly said, ""Come on, Sarah, stop being a party pooper and join us!"" She shot me a glare and said, ""You know I’m not feeling great, right?"" I immediately felt bad but also frustrated because I felt like she was ruining the vibe for everyone else.

Later, during one of the band's more energetic songs, I tried to get everyone to dance, including Sarah. I pulled her up from her seat, and she looked visibly annoyed.

My neighbor, let’s call him Mike, is a nice enough guy but a bit socially awkward. He’s been living next door for a couple of years and is always friendly, but he tends to overshare. A few weeks ago, he invited me over for a barbecue, and during the evening, he started talking about his personal life. He shared that he was going through a tough time with his girlfriend, who had just broken up with him. It was really uncomfortable because he got pretty emotional and talked for a long time about how heartbroken he was and how he felt lost without her.

I listened and tried to be supportive, but honestly, I just wanted to enjoy my food and the company of other guests. After what felt like an eternity of him pouring his heart out, I started to zone out. I eventually made an excuse to step away and ended up chatting with some other friends, hoping he would take the hint and move on.

Fast forward to the next day, I get a text from him thanking me for coming and saying how much he appreciated having someone to talk to. I felt bad because I didn’t really give him my full attention, but I didn’t respond right away. Instead, I just brushed it off. A few days later, Mike texts me again, this time asking if I wanted to hang out sometime and maybe grab a drink. 

At this point, I panicked a little. I didn’t want to lead him on since I wasn’t really interested in becoming closer friends. So I texted him back saying I was busy with work and didn’t have the time to hang out. Instead of just stopping there, I let it go further and said something like, “I hope things get better with your girlfriend.”

I was assigned to help her get acclimated to the team, and while showing her the ropes, I noticed that she consistently made mistakes in her work. I tried to be supportive and patient, but it got to a point where I felt frustrated. I had to redo a lot of her work, which added to my own stress.

Everyone sucks here,"I’ll call this friend Jason. We met in our freshman year of college and quickly bonded over our shared interests in music and gaming. We started hanging out regularly and even formed a band together with a few other friends. Things were great for a while, but I started to notice some changes in Jason’s behavior.

As we got deeper into our music scene, Jason began to act more and more arrogant. He started bragging about his guitar skills and belittling the contributions of the other band members. If someone suggested a new song or a change to our sound, he would dismiss it outright, claiming that he knew better than anyone else. It was frustrating because we were all trying to work together, and Jason’s attitude was creating tension.

One night after a gig, we were hanging out and discussing our next steps as a band. Jason started to go on this long rant about how he was the only reason our band was gaining any attention. I snapped and told him that while he was talented, he was being a jerk, and that teamwork was key to our success. I said something along the lines of, “You’re not the only one in this band; we all contribute, and your attitude is driving us away.” 

He got defensive and started saying that I was just jealous of his talent and that I should recognize how lucky I was to be in a band with someone like him. Things escalated, and we ended up having a heated argument in front of our other bandmates, which was awkward for everyone. 

After that night, things were never the same. The band slowly fell apart, and Jason and I stopped talking. I later found out that some of the other members felt similarly about his attitude but didn’t have the courage to confront him. I feel guilty for not handling the situation more diplomatically, yet I also believe Jason needed to hear how his behavior was affecting us. 

Now, looking back, I realize that I could have communicated my feelings better instead of letting my frustration boil over. Jason, for his part, could have been more humble and open to feedback. Everyone ended up losing in this situation, and I regret how it all played out.",588,2475,0.72,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_99380,2019-06-05 00:00:00,ESH,2120,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My (f28) friend Sarah (f27) and I have been close for years. We share a lot of the same interests, and we often support each other through tough times. Recently, Sarah started dating someone new, Jake (m30), and she seemed really happy. However, I noticed that she started to pull away from our friendship. She was busy, and every time I suggested hanging out, she’d always say she was with Jake or that they had plans. I could tell she was really into him, but it felt like I was losing my best friend.

One day, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I texted Sarah and asked if we could have a girls' night. She responded that she and Jake had plans that night, and I was frustrated. I told her that I felt like I was being pushed aside and that her relationship was taking priority over our friendship. Instead of talking it out, I made a sarcastic remark about how I guess she was too busy to bother with her “old” friend. She got upset and accused me of being jealous and not respecting her new relationship.

In the heat of the moment, I suggested that Jake might not be the right guy for her if he was taking her away from her friends. I know that was a low blow, but I was hurt and wanted her to see what she was doing. Sarah ended up crying and told me that I was being unreasonable and that I should be happy for her instead of trying to sabotage her happiness.

After a few days, I felt guilty and reached out to apologize for my harsh words, but she was still upset. She said she needed some space to figure things out. I feel bad for how I reacted, but I also think she could have made an effort to include me in her new life rather than shutting me out completely.

Everyone sucks here,"This is a throwaway account because I’m not sure how to feel about what happened and I’d like some outside perspective. 

So here’s the situation: I’ve been friends with Sarah for a few years. We’ve had our ups and downs, but I thought we were pretty close. Recently, she started dating this guy, Mike, who I hadn’t met until a month into their relationship. Honestly, he’s not my type at all and I get the feeling Sarah is kind of settling for him. He’s a nice enough guy, but he can be a little overbearing and I’ve seen him put her down more than once in a joking way that doesn’t sit right with me.

Last weekend, Sarah invited me to a small gathering at her place to celebrate her birthday. Mike was there and I could tell he was trying to show off in front of her and her friends. During the night, he made a couple of comments about how Sarah is “lucky” to have him because she’s not exactly a “catch.” I was taken aback and told him that’s not cool and that he should respect her. He brushed it off, but I could see Sarah was uncomfortable.

At that point, I decided to step in. I said some things about how Sarah deserves someone who genuinely appreciates her and that he should be lifting her up, not tearing her down. I didn’t mean to embarrass her in front of everyone, but I felt it was important to defend her. The atmosphere got really tense, and Sarah looked really upset. Mike got defensive, saying I was sticking my nose where it didn’t belong. Sarah ended up leaving the room and I felt terrible.

After the party, Sarah texted me saying that I had overstepped and that it was her business who she dates, not mine. I apologized, but I also told her I was just trying to look out for her. She hasn’t spoken to me since, and now I’m wondering if I should have just kept my mouth shut.

So, AITA for trying to defend my friend from her boyfriend, even if it might have embarrassed her? I feel like I was trying to be a good friend, but maybe I crossed a line.",657,2798,0.83,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_92943,2021-07-24 00:00:00,ESH,1975,AITA

I pushed a bit more, saying that it felt like he was avoiding me, and that it hurt my feelings.

I felt attacked and told him that he was being unreasonable and that I just wanted to understand what was going on. Instead of resolving anything, we ended up arguing, with me raising my voice at times, and him saying I was overreacting. 

Afterward, we both cooled down and I realized I might have pushed too hard for an explanation, but I also felt like he was dismissing my feelings.

He often makes comments about my appearance and tries to engage in overly personal conversations while I’m working, which can be distracting when I’m trying to serve customers.

I’ve tried to brush it off and politely divert the conversation, but he doesn’t seem to take the hint. Last week, I finally reached my limit when he came in wearing a shirt with a funny saying about “stealing hearts” and told me it was my fault he wore it because I “stole his heart.” I snapped and told him that his comments were making me uncomfortable and that he should stop flirting with me because I wasn’t interested.

Instead of backing off, he got defensive and said I was being rude and ungrateful, especially since he was just trying to be friendly. I was pretty frustrated and told him that if he wanted to be friendly, he could keep it professional and stop crossing boundaries. I may have also mentioned that I wouldn’t serve him anymore if he kept it up.

Everyone sucks here,"I'm in a bit of a bind and could really use some outside perspective on my situation. 

A few weeks ago, my friend ""Mark"" invited me to his housewarming party. Mark is known for being a bit of a foodie, and he tends to go all out when it comes to cooking and entertaining. I was really looking forward to it, especially since I’ve been going through a tough time lately and I thought it would be a nice distraction.

On the day of the party, I arrived and immediately noticed that the spread was amazing—homemade dishes, fancy appetizers, and even a dessert table. Mark had put a lot of effort into it, and I appreciated it. However, as I started eating, I couldn't help but notice that some of the food was just not to my taste. I tried a few dishes but ended up not enjoying most of them. 

Instead of just keeping my opinions to myself, I made a few comments to Mark about the food. I didn't mean to be harsh, but I casually remarked that I wasn't a fan of the seasoning in one dish and joked that another looked a bit burnt. I thought we were just joking around, but Mark visibly tightened up and seemed hurt by my remarks.

A few minutes later, his other friends started chiming in, trying to lighten the mood, but it clearly didn’t help. Mark ended up stepping away to the kitchen to regroup, and I felt a pang of guilt realizing that my comments might have hurt him more than I thought.

Later on, when Mark returned, he was quieter than usual and seemed to be doing his best to keep the atmosphere light. I tried to apologize, but it came out awkwardly, and he brushed it off, saying it was fine. However, the mood had shifted, and I could tell that I had ruined the vibe of the party.

As the night went on, I ended up feeling frustrated with the whole situation. I didn't want to be the bad guy, but I felt like everyone else was just ignoring the fact that the food wasn't great. I ended up venting to another friend about how I felt, and that friend told me I shouldn't have criticized Mark's cooking in the first place, especially since it was his party.

Now I’m stuck feeling guilty for my comments to Mark, but I also feel like he could have taken the feedback a bit better, especially from a friend. I don’t want to be the asshole here, but I’m really not sure if I overstepped or if he just needs to learn to take some constructive criticism.

I hadn’t met her until this gathering, but I had heard a bit about her from our parents. They seem to really like her, but I had my reservations based on what I saw on social media.

During dinner, my brother was all lovey-dovey with her, and it made me uncomfortable. I tried to change the subject multiple times, but my parents kept asking about their relationship. Eventually, I just blurted out, “Look, she’s cute and all, but she’s got some pretty cringey posts online. You really want to be with someone who posts that stuff?”

The room went quiet. My brother looked furious, and his girlfriend’s face turned bright red. She tried to defend herself, saying that it was just her way of expressing herself. I pushed back, saying that there’s a difference between self-expression and embarrassing yourself. 

My brother told me to back off and that I was being a jerk. Our parents looked uncomfortable, and then my dad chimed in, asking why I always had to be so negative. I felt ganged up on, but I just couldn’t let it go. I told my brother that if he was so set on dating someone like that, he deserved all the backlash he would get.

Recently, my ex has been trying to bond with our son by taking him out for expensive dinners and buying him things that I can't afford. I’ve always emphasized the importance of spending time together without materialism, so I was frustrated to see my son becoming more enamored with the idea of ""things"" rather than genuine connection. 

After a few weeks of this, I decided to talk to my ex. I expressed my concerns about how this approach could affect our son’s values and that I wished he would focus on experiences rather than gifts. My ex reacted defensively, accusing me of trying to control how he parents. This led to a heated argument where I said some hurtful things about his character and decisions, and he shot back with digs about my own parenting choices.

In the heat of the moment, I also mentioned that I felt like he was trying to buy our son’s affection. He was furious and threatened to take me back to court for custody, which I don't think he actually wants to do, but it made me realize I might have gone too far.

Now I feel guilty about how the conversation escalated and how it might affect our son. I’m trying to set boundaries, but I also might have overstepped. My ex probably shouldn’t have reacted the way he did either, given that we both want what’s best for our son.

Everyone sucks here,"This happened last week at my local gym. I've been going there for a few years now and usually stick to the same routine. One day, I noticed a newcomer taking up a bench press that was part of my usual workout. I didn't say anything at first, assuming they would be finished soon.

After waiting for about 15 minutes, I approached and politely asked how many sets they had left. The person, a guy, looked at me and said he had a few more, but it would be ""just a few minutes."" I nodded and went to use some nearby equipment, keeping an eye on the bench.

When he still hadn’t finished after another 10 minutes, I grew impatient. I walked over and said something like, “Hey man, I’ve been waiting a while. Can you wrap it up?” He shot back that he was using the bench and hadn’t seen a sign saying I had dibs on it, which was fair enough.

Instead of backing off, I might have gotten a bit defensive and said, “Maybe if you weren’t so busy playing on your phone between sets, you could finish faster.” He got annoyed and told me to chill out, and then I called him a “selfish gym hog” and walked away.

I (F) recently moved in with my boyfriend (M) after a few years of dating. We were super excited to take this step together, but I didn't anticipate how different our living styles would be. I’m pretty organized and like to keep things tidy, while he tends to be more laid-back and doesn't mind a bit of mess.

At first, I tried to be accommodating and let things slide. I figured we’d find a balance eventually. But as time went on, I found myself getting increasingly frustrated. The kitchen was always messy—dishes piled up, food left out, and crumbs everywhere. I started cleaning up after him, thinking it would help him realize how bothersome it was. But it only seemed to make him more indifferent to the mess.

After a couple of months, I exploded one night. I confronted him about his lack of consideration for our shared space and how it was driving me crazy. He got defensive and said I was being uptight and need to relax. I countered that he was being lazy and just expecting me to pick up after him. 

In the heat of the moment, we both said some really hurtful things. I told him maybe I should just start charging him for my ""cleaning services,"" and he said I was acting like a ""controlling psycho."" After that fight, we were both upset and the atmosphere at home became tense.

We eventually had a calmer talk, but I still can't shake the feeling that we both contributed to this issue. I'm frustrated with his messiness, but I also feel I overreacted and might have come off as controlling.

We’ve been in the same department for a couple of years, and while we aren’t best friends, we generally get along and sometimes hang out after work. Recently, I was offered a promotion that would require me to move to a different city. I was thrilled and told Jason about it, excited to share the news with someone I considered a friend.

However, Jason seemed unusually interested in my move. A few days later, he approached me with the idea of moving to that city as well and applying for a job in my new company. I wasn't sure how to feel about it. On one hand, I thought it might be nice to have a familiar face around. On the other hand, I was worried about the dynamics of our relationship changing, especially since this was such a big opportunity for me.

Fast forward a month, and Jason applied for the same job I did. He ended up getting hired, and now we're both moving to the same city and working together. At first, I tried to be supportive, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was trying to insert himself into my life in a way that felt a bit overwhelming. 

Once we started working together, I noticed that he was very eager to be included in everything I did. He would invite himself to my lunch plans, ask to join my gym sessions, and even show up at social gatherings I organized with other colleagues. I felt suffocated and began to pull away, wanting to maintain some independence in this new chapter of my life.

One day, I had planned a small get-together at my place to celebrate my promotion with just a few close friends. I mentioned it in passing to Jason, thinking he would understand it was meant for a small group. But to my surprise, he invited himself and brought along a couple of his own friends without asking me first. I was annoyed and felt like he was disregarding the nature of the gathering. 

During the party, I tried to enjoy myself, but Jason’s friends were loud and disruptive, and it felt like my friends were overshadowed. I ended up venting about it to a couple of my close friends later that night, saying that I felt like my achievement was being overshadowed and that I needed some space.

The next day, Jason confronted me about what I said. He felt hurt that I had talked about him and his friends that way, and he thought I was being rude and ungrateful since he was just trying to celebrate with me. I admit, I could have handled it better and communicated my feelings directly to him instead of talking behind his back.

So now I’m wondering, did I overreact by feeling frustrated with him? Should I have been more upfront about needing my space? 

TLDR; My coworker followed me to a new job and city after I shared my promotion news, and now I feel overwhelmed by his presence in my life.

I’ve tried to reach out and support him, but he often brushes me off or says he just needs time alone. I understand that everyone deals with their problems differently, but I’ve felt pretty helpless watching him go through this.

However, later that night, I saw on social media that he went out with another group of friends to a different event instead of staying home as he had told me.

I felt betrayed and hurt. I ended up confronting him the next day, and I might have come on too strong. I told him that it really sucked that he couldn’t be honest with me and that it felt like he was making excuses to avoid hanging out with me. I expressed that I understood he was going through a tough time, but it didn’t justify treating our friendship that way. Instead of really talking it out, he got defensive and accused me of being selfish for expecting him to always be available for me.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I recently went to a friend's gathering where a bunch of us were hanging out and playing games. There was this new guy there, ""Jake,"" who was super friendly and fit right in. At one point, we were all joking around, and I made a light-hearted comment about how Jake looked like a celebrity – it was all in good fun, and everyone laughed.

Later in the evening, I overheard Jake talking to some of the other guys about how he used to have a pretty rough time in high school with bullying and feeling insecure about his looks. I felt bad for him and wanted to lighten the mood, so I joined their conversation. I ended up jokingly saying, “Well, you know, you might not be as hot as that celebrity I mentioned, but you’re definitely not bad looking!”

The vibe shifted pretty quickly. Jake's smile faded, and he awkwardly laughed it off, but I could tell I had hit a nerve. After that, I noticed he was more withdrawn and didn't engage much for the rest of the night. A couple of my friends later told me that my comment was insensitive and that I should apologize because they thought it really affected him.

Looking back, I realize I was trying to be funny and supportive, but I may have just ended up being clumsy and hurtful. I didn’t apologize at the time because I thought it was just a joke. Now I feel bad about it, but I also think Jake kind of overreacted to a harmless joke.

Everyone sucks here,"Last month, my friend and I decided to plan a weekend getaway to the beach. We were both really excited, but as the date approached, I started to feel overwhelmed with work and personal commitments. I had a lot on my plate, and I was worried that I wouldn’t fully enjoy the trip.

The night before we were supposed to leave, I called my friend and suggested we postpone the trip. I explained how stressed I was and that I didn’t want to ruin the weekend for both of us by being distracted. My friend was really upset and felt like I was backing out on her. She insisted that we should just go and that I’d feel better once we were there.

I ended up feeling guilty and agreed to go, but throughout the trip, I was preoccupied with my worries and couldn’t relax. I barely participated in the activities and kept checking my work emails. My friend got frustrated with me and called me out for ruining the mood and not being present. We ended up having a fight, and I shouted that if she really cared about me, she would understand that I was struggling.

Looking back, I realize that both of us could have handled the situation better. I shouldn’t have agreed to go if I wasn’t ready, and she shouldn’t have pressured me into going when I was clearly struggling. Now, I feel terrible for how I treated her during the trip, and I’m not sure if I was in the right for wanting to postpone.

Everyone sucks here,"I live with my partner in a small apartment, and we both work full-time jobs. Recently, my partner decided to adopt a cat from a local shelter. She was really excited about it, and I supported her decision, although I didn’t have much experience with cats. The shelter told her the cat had a few behavioral issues, but they assured her that with some patience, he would settle in.

At first, everything seemed fine, but then the cat started to act out. He would knock things over, scratch the furniture, and meow loudly at night, keeping us both awake. I tried to be understanding, but it was getting really frustrating for me, especially since I was already tired from work.

My partner, in an effort to help the cat adjust, started trying various training tips she found online. She spent a lot of time playing with him and giving him attention, but I felt like it wasn’t enough. I expressed my concerns to her, saying that we needed to be more firm with him. She would get defensive and say that he was just scared, and we needed to be patient.

One evening, after a particularly rough night of sleep thanks to the cat’s antics, I snapped. I told her that if she couldn’t get the cat under control, we would have to consider returning him to the shelter. She got upset and accused me of not caring about her feelings or the cat’s well-being. I didn’t mean it in a harsh way; I just felt overwhelmed and at my wit’s end.

The next day, she confronted me again about my comments, and we ended up having a heated argument. I ended up calling her too soft for not being stricter with the cat, and she called me cruel for suggesting we return him. Neither of us backed down, and it turned into a bigger fight than I expected.

Now, we’re both feeling hurt and resentful. I know I could have approached the situation better, and I realize my partner was just trying to do her best. But I also feel like she should have listened to my concerns. We both contributed to the situation spiraling out of control, and now the cat is still having issues, and our relationship is a bit strained.",43,2503,0.69,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_23294,2019-10-15 00:00:00,ESH,2083,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Throwaway account, my partner is on Reddit.

So, I (F) recently moved in with my boyfriend (M) after dating for a couple of years. I was excited to start this new chapter together, but there have been some bumps along the way. 

One of the biggest issues has been about house chores and responsibilities. Before moving in together, we had talked about sharing chores equally, but after we moved in, I noticed that I was doing the majority of the household tasks—cleaning, cooking, laundry, you name it. I tried to bring it up casually, but he brushed it off, saying he was busy with work and that I was better at keeping things tidy.

After a few weeks of this, I snapped. I confronted him about the unfair distribution of chores, and things escalated into a fight. I ended up saying some hurtful things about how I felt like I was his maid rather than his partner. He got defensive and accused me of being controlling and not respecting his work commitments. 

In the heat of the moment, I also mentioned that his lack of contribution made me question whether I wanted to be with someone who wouldn’t pull their weight in a relationship. That was incredibly hurtful, and I regret saying it.

Now, we’re in a weird place. He feels disrespected, and I feel unappreciated. We both apologized afterwards, but I can’t shake the feeling that we both contributed to the breakdown of our communication. 

So, AITA for expressing my frustration about the chores, or did he also overreact and take my words too harshly? I really want us to work through this, but I don’t know where to start.",916,2667,0.65,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_14642,2021-07-16 00:00:00,ESH,1582,AITA

After I finished up, I decided to head over to the party around midnight. When I arrived, I noticed the party was in full swing, and everyone seemed to be having a great time. I walked in and immediately felt the vibe shift. Jake was visibly annoyed and said something like, ""Look who finally decided to show up!"" 

I tried to lighten the mood by joking about how I had an important meeting with my couch earlier that night, but Jake wasn’t having it. He said that since I was so late, I shouldn’t be surprised if everyone was a bit tired of the party and ready to wind down. I felt a bit embarrassed and tried to apologize for being late.

Later, while we were hanging out, I overheard Jake talking to another friend about how I was the worst for being so late and how I ruined the vibe of the party. That really hurt me, and I couldn’t help but confront him about it. I told him that I thought he was being overly dramatic and that it was unfair to expect me to drop everything for a party. He snapped back that it was really rude of me to show up after everyone else had already been having fun for hours.

After that, the mood of the night shifted even more. It became awkward, and other guests started to pick up on the tension. I eventually left, feeling frustrated and upset. I later texted Jake to let him know I was disappointed in how he handled the situation, and he replied that I was being sensitive and that I shouldn't make it a big deal.

Everyone sucks here,"TLDR: I got upset when my partner forgot our anniversary, and in retaliation, I didn't acknowledge their birthday. Should I feel guilty?

For context: Our anniversary is a special day for me. I always put a lot of thought into celebrating it, whether it's planning a nice dinner or getting a thoughtful gift. This year, I had planned something nice, but when the day came, my partner completely forgot about it. They were busy with work and didn't even remember to text me. I was hurt, especially since we had talked about it weeks in advance.

When their birthday rolled around a couple of weeks later, I was still feeling hurt about the anniversary and, in a moment of spite, I didn't do anything for their birthday. No card, no gift, not even a simple “happy birthday” text. I figured it was a way to show them how it felt to be overlooked.

When they finally asked me why I didn’t acknowledge their birthday, I explained that I was angry about our anniversary. They felt hurt and claimed I was being childish. They said they had planned to celebrate with friends and didn't think it was a big deal that they forgot the anniversary. This led to a big argument where we both said things we regretted.

Now, I'm questioning my actions. I know it was petty to not celebrate their birthday because I was hurt, but at the same time, I felt justified in my feelings. Was I wrong to retaliate, or was I just standing up for myself? I don't want to be the type of person who holds grudges, but I also dislike being treated as if my feelings don’t matter.

A few weeks ago, we were at a party, and Jake started making fun of another friend’s recent breakup. He kept using it as a prop for his jokes, and I could see that our friend was uncomfortable. I tried to tell Jake to cut it out, but he just laughed it off and said I was being too serious.

Everyone sucks here,"Some context: I recently graduated from college and moved to a new city for my first job. I’ve been trying to make new friends, but it’s been a bit tough. A few weeks ago, I met a group of coworkers at a bar after work and invited them to join a trivia night at another bar the following week. They all seemed excited and said they’d come.

On the day of the trivia night, I spent hours preparing fun trivia questions and snacks to bring along. I even made a fun playlist to set the mood. When I arrived at the bar, I waited for over an hour, but only one coworker showed up. The others texted to say they were busy or had forgotten. I was really disappointed and felt embarrassed because I had hyped it up.

Feeling hurt and frustrated, I decided to vent my anger to my coworker. I started complaining about how they’d all flaked on me and how inconsiderate it was, rather loudly, thinking it would be better to make a point rather than let it slide. My coworker tried to calm me down, saying sometimes things come up and not to take it personally. I was too emotional at that point and snapped back, saying they were all unreliable and it was a waste of time to even bother trying to make friends.

Eventually, I ended up calling out the others on a group chat, publicly airing my grievances about how they never support each other. It turned into a dramatic exchange with a lot of back-and-forth insults. Some apologized, while others defended their actions, leading to a chaotic group chat filled with negativity.

Looking back, I realize I should have handled it differently and not let my emotions get the best of me. At the same time, I feel like my coworkers could have been more considerate.

Everyone sucks here,"This is my first time posting here, so I hope I'm following the guidelines correctly. I’m on mobile, so please excuse any typos or awkward formatting. TLDR at the bottom.

I (28F) have a younger brother (22M) who lives with our parents. Recently, I've been trying to help him out with his finances since he decided to quit his job to pursue a career in music. I understand his passion, but I also think he needs to be more responsible while he’s figuring things out.

A few weeks ago, I lent him $500 to help cover his rent. I made it clear that I needed him to pay me back in a couple of months. He was very grateful and promised he would. However, I noticed that he started posting on social media about going to concerts and hanging out with friends quite a bit. It made me feel uneasy since I thought he was spending money that he could be using to pay me back.

After thinking about it for a week, I confronted him. I basically said that while I support his music dreams, he shouldn't be spending money on entertainment when he still owes me money. He got defensive and said it was his life and he shouldn’t have to justify his spending to me. I was frustrated and told him that I didn't want to see him waste the help I was giving him and that he should grow up and take responsibility.

In the heat of the moment, I ended up calling him immature and said he was acting like a child. He got really upset and stormed off. I felt bad afterward because I didn’t mean to hurt him, but I also felt like he needed a reality check.

Later, I vented to my friends about the situation, expressing that I was frustrated and that I thought my brother was being irresponsible. A couple of my friends thought I was too harsh and suggested I should’ve approached it differently, but they also agreed that my brother needs to be more responsible.

Now I’m feeling conflicted. I want to support my brother and his dreams, but I also want him to learn how to manage his finances. I don’t think I handled the situation well, and I’m not sure where to draw the line between being supportive and being tough on him.

I was upset and replied, “I’m allowed to have fun too, Sarah.

When I pointed it out, Mark laughed it off and said it was just a tablecloth and not to worry about it.

Eventually, I felt I had to step in more firmly and told her that the jokes were inappropriate and that we were all there to have a good time, not to offend anyone.

Sarah took offense and started to argue with me, saying I was being too uptight and that I needed to lighten up. I was really frustrated at this point, especially since I was the host and wanted everyone to feel welcome. I insisted that she needed to stop, but this just made her angrier, and she started yelling at me in front of everyone. 

My partner tried to diffuse the situation by suggesting we change the subject, but instead, it escalated into a shouting match between Sarah and me. During the argument, I said some pretty harsh things in the heat of the moment, like that I didn't want her at my place anymore if she was going to act like that. I regret saying that because it was hurtful and not the way I wanted the night to go.

After Sarah left in tears, I felt terrible. I knew I could have handled it better, but I also felt justified in wanting to stand up for my other guests who were uncomfortable. My partner thought I was too harsh on Sarah and said I should have just let it go instead of escalating things. The other friends who were there were split; some thought I did the right thing, while others felt I overreacted.

So, was I the asshole for confronting Sarah about her behavior at my party, or was she out of line for not respecting the atmosphere I was trying to create?",14,581,0.67,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_45680,2024-12-09 00:00:00,ESH,2014,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I need some perspective because I feel like I might have crossed a line, but I also think my partner is being unreasonable.

So, my boyfriend Alex and I have been together for about two years now. Recently, he started a new job that requires him to travel a lot. I totally get that work is important, but he’s been gone for weeks at a time, and it’s been tough on me. To cope with the loneliness, I started spending more time with my friends and even took up a new hobby, painting.

I’ve always enjoyed expressing myself through art, but I never took it seriously until now. I’ve been posting my paintings on social media, and I’m actually getting a decent response from people. It feels nice to get compliments and encouragement, especially since I’ve been feeling a bit neglected by Alex while he’s away.

Now, here’s where things got complicated. One night, while I was painting, I received a text from Alex. He was in a hotel room and seemed to be feeling pretty lonely too. I decided to share my latest painting with him to lift his spirits. He replied with a quick “That’s nice,” but then he went on to say that he didn’t understand why I felt the need to post my art online. He thinks it’s “cringey” and that I’m just seeking validation from strangers.

This hurt because I felt like he was dismissing something that brings me joy. I tried to explain that for me, it’s not just about the attention; it’s about expressing myself and growing as an artist. But he got defensive and said I was “doing it for likes” and that it was embarrassing. I didn’t handle that well—I snapped back that he’s the one who’s been out of touch with me while I’m here trying to fill the void he’s leaving. I even said something harsh about how he should be more supportive instead of tearing me down.

After that, we ended up in a big argument where we both said things we regretted. I told him that if he can’t support me, maybe he doesn’t deserve to be with someone who’s trying to better themselves. He called me immature for being so upset about a simple opinion and said I need to get over myself.

Now we haven’t talked in a couple of days, and I feel really conflicted. I think we both acted poorly—he shouldn’t have belittled my passion, and I shouldn’t have lashed out like that. So, AITA for wanting him to support my art instead of criticizing it?",632,2457,0.97,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_12867,2023-07-25 00:00:00,ESH,2344,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I have been together for about three years now, and generally, things are good between us. However, we recently had a pretty big fight that I still can’t wrap my head around. 

I’ve always had a close friendship with my childhood best friend, who happens to be female. We grew up together, and we’ve been there for each other through thick and thin. My partner knows about this friendship and has always been fairly understanding. However, she has expressed jealousy a few times, especially when my friend and I started hanging out more often.

Last week, my friend was going through a tough time and reached out to me for support. We met up at a coffee shop to talk, and I didn’t think much of it. I figured my partner would understand that I wanted to be there for my friend during her rough patch. 

When I got home, my partner was waiting for me, visibly upset. She had seen a post on social media where I tagged my friend in a supportive message and a photo from our coffee date. Instead of discussing it calmly, she immediately accused me of putting my friend before her and said I was disrespecting our relationship. I tried to explain that it was just a supportive gesture and that I wasn't trying to hide anything from her, but she was furious.

In response, I got defensive and told her she was overreacting. I mentioned how I’ve always been there for her, and she shouldn’t be so insecure about my friendship. Things escalated, and we both said hurtful things. I told her that if she didn't trust me, maybe she shouldn't be with me, and she shot back that maybe I needed to choose between my best friend and her.

Now, I feel bad about how we both handled the situation. I see her point about boundaries, but at the same time, I think I deserve to have close friendships without feeling guilty. I also regret the way I responded in the heat of the moment.

While we were eating, a couple nearby set up a small barbecue. The smell of the grilled food was amazing, and we were all joking about how we wished we had brought something to grill as well. Then, one of the kids from that family accidentally ran into our picnic area, knocking over a drink that we had brought. It spilled everywhere, and my friend was understandably upset about it.

I called out to the parents, who were just lounging and not paying attention, and said, “Hey, can you please keep your kids away from our stuff?” They looked over, and instead of apologizing, they just rolled their eyes and said it wasn’t a big deal.

At that point, I was annoyed. I stood up and pointed out how they were being irresponsible and should be watching their kids better. The dad got defensive and said we were being overly dramatic. I felt justified, but looking back, I realize I might have overreacted. My friends were mixed; some thought I was right, while others said I should’ve just let it go.

After that, I mumbled something about how some people have no respect for others, and the mom shot back that maybe we shouldn’t be so uptight. I ended up walking back to our blanket and grumbling about it, feeling a mix of anger and regret.

My friend Sam has recently lost a lot of weight and has been very vocal about his diet and fitness journey. While I was at the party, he kept bringing up his progress and making comments about how people need to take their health seriously. It felt like he was judging everyone who didn’t follow his lifestyle, including our mutual friends who enjoy eating junk food or aren’t as focused on fitness.

At one point, I tried to lighten the mood by joking, “Well, I guess I’ll just have to eat cake for the rest of my life then!” Sam didn’t take it well and responded with, “Maybe if you cared about your health, you wouldn’t joke about it.” I felt like he was attacking me, so I snapped back, “At least I can enjoy life without being a fitness fanatic! If you’re so perfect, then why are you always talking about it?” 

Things escalated quickly, and soon we were both shouting at each other in front of everyone. Our friends looked uncomfortable, and I could tell that I had crossed a line. Eventually, I stormed out, and Sam ended up sulking in a corner for the rest of the night.

I totally get that it’s a big deal for her, and she’s been putting a lot of effort into it.

Mike asked if it would be okay to combine the two events since both are happening around the same time. He thought it would be a fun way to celebrate both milestones together. I thought it was a great idea and mentioned it to Jessica, but she reacted really negatively. She insisted that her baby shower should be a standalone event and not mixed with anything else, saying it would take away from her special moment.

I felt bad for Mike, who was looking forward to sharing his news, so I suggested to Jessica that she could just keep her shower the way she wanted and that we could help celebrate Mike on a different day. Jessica wasn’t having it and accused me of not supporting her and prioritizing Mike's engagement over her baby shower.

In the heat of the moment, I got frustrated and said something like, “It’s just a baby shower; it’s not like you’re giving birth there.” That really hurt Jessica’s feelings, and she called me insensitive.

We were playing a board game, and Sarah kept making sarcastic comments every time someone else made a mistake. I noticed that she was particularly harsh towards one of our newer friends, Alex, who was clearly nervous and trying to join in. After the third or fourth jibe, I finally said, “Hey, can you chill out a bit? It’s just a game, and Alex is trying his best.” 

Sarah got defensive and accused me of trying to be the “fun police.” I didn’t mean to ruin the night, but I felt it was unfair what she was doing. In retaliation, she shot back with, “Well, at least I’m not the one who takes board games way too seriously!” 

The rest of the group went quiet, and I felt embarrassed. I snapped back, “Says the person who has to make fun of others to feel good about herself.” It escalated from there, and we ended up arguing in front of everyone.

I felt for her situation, but I also have my own bills and expenses, so I offered her a small amount that I could comfortably afford to give without expecting it back. I thought it was a nice gesture, but I told her that I couldn't provide any more than that because I had my own financial goals and savings to consider.

She got really upset and started accusing me of being unsupportive and selfish. She said that because I have a stable job and a decent income, I should be willing to help her more without hesitation. I tried to explain that I care about her and want to support her, but that I can’t jeopardize my own financial stability. Instead of understanding, she called me a ""privileged brat"" and said I clearly don’t care about family.

After that, I found myself feeling hurt and defensive. I snapped back, saying that she should have planned better for her business instead of relying on family to bail her out when things got tough. We ended up having a huge argument, and I hung up on her. I feel bad about how it escalated, but I also think she needs to understand that being family doesn’t mean I can sacrifice my financial security for her comfort.

Now, I’m wondering if I overreacted or if she was out of line for expecting more from me. AITA?",926,2517,0.59,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_53198,2023-12-15 00:00:00,ESH,1751,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, I’m in a bit of a dilemma and honestly, I think we’re both at fault here, but I’d like to get some perspective.

I (28F) have a cousin, Leah (26F), who I used to be really close with growing up. We spent a lot of time together, but over the last few years, our lives have taken different paths. Leah recently got engaged, and while I’m happy for her, I feel like she’s become a bit self-absorbed and has distanced herself from family.

A couple of weeks ago, Leah threw an engagement party and invited all our family members. I wasn’t able to attend due to a prior commitment, but I made sure to send her a nice gift and text her congratulating her. A few days later, I saw some posts on social media from the party, and it looked like everyone had a great time.

I decided to reach out to Leah to catch up since we hadn’t really talked in a while. When I did, she barely asked about me or my life and instead went on and on about her wedding plans. I get it; it’s a big deal for her, but I felt kind of ignored. I mentioned a few things that were going on in my life, but she quickly changed the subject back to her wedding.

In a moment of frustration, I made a comment about how it must be nice to be so focused on one event while the rest of us have to deal with our mundane lives. I thought it would be taken lightly, but Leah got really upset. She accused me of being jealous and not supporting her during one of the happiest times of her life. In response, I said that she’s been so wrapped up in her own world that she’s forgotten about her family, and it’s not like I didn’t want to support her but it felt one-sided.

Now, we’re both annoyed at each other. I feel bad for what I said, but I also feel like she’s being insensitive to my feelings. I haven’t reached out since, and I’m starting to wonder if I crossed a line. Should I have just kept my mouth shut, or is she being unreasonable?

Everyone sucks here,"This is a situation I've been replaying in my mind a lot, and I really need some perspective on it. 

So, a few months ago, I was part of a small community volunteering group that worked on local environmental projects. We had a pretty tight-knit group, and for the most part, we all got along really well. However, there was one member, let's call him Jake, who was just really hard to deal with. He was super passionate about environmental issues, which was great, but he would often lecture everyone on what they were doing wrong. It became really frustrating because instead of being collaborative, he made us feel like we were incompetent.

For example, during a project where we were cleaning up a park, Jake criticized our strategy for how we were sorting the trash. Instead of offering constructive help, he belittled our efforts, calling us ""lazy"" and ""misguided."" We tried to talk to him about being more supportive, but he just brushed it off, claiming he was only trying to help us be better. 

Eventually, a few of us started to distance ourselves from him. We would whisper about it during meetings and rolled our eyes whenever he spoke. I even made a joke in the group chat about how ""Jake should give a TED talk on how to ruin a volunteer project,"" and it got a lot of likes. I felt guilty about it afterward, especially when Jake confronted me about it. He said he felt unwelcome and that he was really trying to help. I apologized but also explained that his approach was making it hard for us to work together.

Now, I feel caught in this weird place. I mean, I don’t think he was a terrible person per se, but he really didn't know how to communicate with the group. Still, our behavior towards him wasn’t great either, and I feel bad for making him feel unwanted. I see the situation as a mix of my group being overly critical and Jake being oblivious to how he came across. So now I’m wondering, am I the asshole for how I acted, or is he just as much to blame for not being more considerate? I'm really torn between ESH and NAH, so I’d love to hear what you all think.",574,966,0.59,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_56498,2022-01-02 00:00:00,ESH,2091,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, here's the situation. I've been part of a friend group for a few years now, and we often hang out together. Recently, one of my friends, Alex, started dating someone new, and while I was initially supportive, I noticed that our group dynamic changed pretty drastically. 

Alex's new girlfriend, Lisa, is really sweet but also incredibly sensitive. Not in a bad way; she’s just very expressive and wears her heart on her sleeve. However, she also tends to take things personally and can overreact when she feels like someone is being critical of her. I get that she wants to fit in, but it can feel a bit stifling, especially when it comes to making lighthearted jokes or teasing, which is something our group has always done.

One evening while we were all hanging out, I made a playful comment about how Alex would forget his head if it wasn’t attached to his shoulders, which was something I often said before Lisa joined the group. I said it in a lighthearted tone and everyone laughed, but Lisa got visibly upset and accused me of being mean to Alex. I was taken aback because it was all in good fun, and I genuinely didn’t think it was a big deal.

I tried to explain that it was just our usual banter and that Alex wasn’t hurt by it at all, but Lisa wouldn’t let it go. The atmosphere became tense, and I could tell she felt like I was attacking her boyfriend, even though that was never my intent. Eventually, I got frustrated and snapped a bit, telling her that she was overreacting and that not everything is about her feelings. That definitely didn’t help, and it made the situation worse.

Afterward, Alex pulled me aside and told me that while he appreciated my humor, it might be best to tone it down around Lisa since she wasn’t used to our dynamic and I should’ve considered her feelings. I felt really caught in the middle because I didn’t want to feel like I had to change who I was just because Lisa was sensitive. 

I ended up apologizing to both of them, but I still feel like there’s a weird tension lingering. I’m frustrated that I feel like I have to walk on eggshells now, and I think Lisa could have handled the situation better too. I don’t know if I was wrong to joke around or if Lisa overreacted.

Everyone sucks here,"I'm a 24-year-old guy living with my younger sister, who's 21, while we both save money for our own places. We've always been close, but living together has been a challenge. My sister is a bit of a hoarder. She has this habit of collecting clothes, shoes, and random stuff that she thinks she might use someday, and it’s taken over the living room and our shared spaces.

I’ve tried talking to her about it before, but she gets defensive. She insists that she has plans for everything she owns, even when it’s just piled up and collecting dust. I’ve explained that it makes the place feel cramped and messy, but she just shrugs it off, saying it’s her stuff and she likes it that way.

One day, I had a bunch of friends over for a small get-together, and I didn’t want them to see how cluttered our apartment had become. I decided to take matters into my own hands. I spent the whole day while she was at work going through her things. I sorted out the clothes that were obviously never worn, the shoes that had been in the corner for months, and all the random junk that was just taking up space. I packed up several bags for donation and threw away some things that were clearly broken or unusable.

When my sister got home, she was furious. She couldn’t believe I’d gone through her stuff without asking. I tried to explain that I was just trying to make the space more livable for both of us, but she felt completely disrespected. She threw a huge tantrum about how I had no right to decide what was valuable to her and accused me of being controlling.

In retaliation, she started leaving her things all over my side of the room, including shoes and clothes. I snapped and told her that if she wanted to keep the place cluttered, it was her problem, but I wouldn’t keep picking up after her. We ended up arguing back and forth, and now the tension in our apartment is unbearable.

We've had our ups and downs, but I thought we were on the same page when it came to parenting. One of the major issues, however, is that my partner has a habit of making snarky comments about my parenting style and how I handle our son’s behavior.

Recently, our son has been struggling with his homework, and I’ve been trying to help him. I sit down with him, go through the material, and encourage him to ask questions. Meanwhile, my partner thinks it's better to just let our son ""figure it out on his own"" and often rolls their eyes when I’m trying to assist. 

One evening, I found out that our son had been hiding his homework because he was embarrassed about not understanding it and was worried about getting criticized. I was upset and confronted my partner about their dismissive attitude. Instead of being supportive, they snapped back, saying I was “babying” our son and ruining his independence. 

In a moment of frustration, I shot back that my partner's approach was reckless and that they should stop acting like a know-it-all. I also mentioned that they were often too focused on their own interests to notice how our son was struggling. This led to a big fight where we both said things we regretted. 

Now, our son feels caught in the middle, and I can't help but feel guilty for how we handled it.

Everyone sucks here,"**BACK STORY**: A couple of years ago, I (28M) started a new job and quickly became friends with a coworker named Sarah (26F). We bonded over our love for movies, music, and video games, and our friendship grew really close. We often hung out outside of work and had a great time together.

Eventually, I introduced her to my best friend, Mike (29M), who I thought would hit it off with her. They started dating, and I was genuinely happy for them. They were super into each other, and I felt like I had played a small part in bringing them together. 

However, after a few months, things started to change. Mike became distant and began complaining to me about Sarah, saying she was too clingy and that he didn’t feel the same way about her anymore. I tried to support him and reassure him that relationships go through ups and downs, but he ultimately broke up with her. I didn’t know how to handle it, so I stayed neutral, wanting to preserve my friendship with both of them.

The issue: About six months after their breakup, I was at a party at a mutual friend's house, and both Sarah and Mike were invited. I hadn’t seen Sarah in a while, and when she showed up, she looked amazing. I couldn’t help but compliment her, saying, “Wow, you look incredible! What’s your secret?” She smiled, and we chatted for a bit, reminiscing about old times.

Later in the evening, while we were all hanging out, Mike made a snide remark about how Sarah had changed since they dated. He laughed and said, “Yeah, it’s funny how people look better when they’re not your problem anymore.” It felt really inappropriate, and I could see Sarah’s face drop. I shot him a look to let him know to cut it out, but he just shrugged it off.

In a moment of frustration and to diffuse the tension, I responded, “I think Sarah always looked great. Her style has just evolved.” Mike snapped back, stating that it was just a joke and that I was taking it too seriously. Sarah seemed relieved I stood up for her, but the vibe shifted, and the rest of the night felt awkward.

After the party, Mike confronted me, saying I embarrassed him in front of everyone and that I shouldn’t have defended Sarah. He felt I was betraying him by not backing him up. I told him I was just being honest and that his comment was out of line. Now, there’s tension between us, and Sarah feels caught in the middle.

The loud music and chatter from her and her friends often keeps me awake, which has been affecting my job performance. I tried talking to her about it, explaining how it disrupts my sleep schedule and affects my work. She apologized but said she just wanted to have fun and socialize.

Last week, after a particularly exhausting week at work, she had another gathering. I asked her to keep the noise down, but she didn't seem to take me seriously. I got so frustrated that I decided to blast my own music really loud in my room to drown hers out. We ended up shouting at each other through the walls, and I told her she should be more considerate. She accused me of being uptight and not letting her enjoy her life. 

Now we’re both upset and not talking much. My other friends who know about the situation say I was too harsh with my reaction, while some of them think she should respect my need for quiet.

Everyone sucks here,"This happened a couple of weeks ago at a friend's birthday party. There was a decent-sized group of people, and the vibe was pretty relaxed. I have a pretty sarcastic sense of humor, but I sometimes forget that not everyone appreciates it the same way I do.

So, my friend Sarah was telling a story about a recent vacation where she got lost in a foreign city. As she was sharing, she started to embellish a bit, making it sound like a big adventure. In the middle of her story, I couldn’t help myself and interrupted with a joke about how she probably just followed a hot guy around and ended up in a sketchy part of town because of it. 

At first, a few people chuckled, but I could see that Sarah looked a little uncomfortable. Instead of backing off, I doubled down and made another sarcastic comment about how she definitely ""shouldn’t have trusted a guy who looked like he belonged in a horror movie."" The laughter from the group faded, and it was clear I had crossed a line.

Sarah got visibly upset and said, ""Wow, thanks for that. I’m actually trying to tell a fun story here."" I brushed it off, thinking she was just being overly sensitive. I joked back, ""C’mon, it’s all in good fun!"" 

After that, the mood in the room shifted. A couple of other friends chimed in, saying I was being rude and that I should apologize. I felt a mix of embarrassment and defensiveness, so I sarcastically said, ""Well, if everyone’s so sensitive, maybe I’ll just sit in the corner and not say anything!"" That definitely didn’t help.

In the end, I did apologize to Sarah later that night when things had cooled down, but it felt forced, and I was still annoyed that everyone had ganged up on me.

I’m not against gaming, but he tends to play loud, action-packed games late into the night, often waking me up. I asked him nicely to keep the volume down or use headphones during late hours, but he brushed it off saying, “It’s my place too, I’ll play how I want.”

After a few nights of this, I got really frustrated and decided to take matters into my own hands.

In a moment of frustration, I ended up texting her and expressing how uncomfortable I felt about their relationship. I told her that I thought it was inappropriate for her to lean on my partner like that, especially since we’re friends. She responded by saying that I was being controlling and that I needed to trust my partner more. She accused me of being jealous and said she would back off if it made me uncomfortable.

Now, my partner is upset with me for involving her and thinks I overreacted. He feels that I should have just talked to him instead of reaching out to her. I genuinely thought I was standing up for our relationship, but I can see how my actions might have been too extreme.

AITA? I feel like I was justified in wanting to protect my relationship, but I also understand that reaching out to her might have been crossing a line.",505,2687,0.6,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_88370,2024-02-24 00:00:00,ESH,1639,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My friend group has a tradition of going out for dinner to celebrate each other's birthdays. We usually pick a place that we all enjoy and order a variety of foods to share. This year, it was my turn to celebrate my birthday, and I was excited to choose a cozy restaurant known for its amazing tapas.

A few days before the celebration, I casually mentioned to my friends that I was looking forward to trying the paella. One of my friends, Sarah, who has been vegetarian for a few years, made a comment about how the paella usually contains seafood and meat, and she wouldn’t be able to eat it. I offered to look for a vegetarian option on the menu, but she insisted that it was fine and she would just eat the sides.

When we arrived at the restaurant, I saw that the paella was indeed a major highlight on the menu, and I decided to order it as the centerpiece of our meal. I also ordered a few vegetarian tapas, thinking it would please Sarah. When the paella arrived, she looked visibly upset and said she felt excluded because she couldn’t eat the main dish we had all come together to enjoy.

I tried to reassure her that we’d have plenty of food to share, but she ended up sulking for most of the night. I felt annoyed because I had tried to accommodate her by ordering vegetarian options, and it was my birthday celebration. I thought it was unfair for her to make me feel guilty about my choice.

Later in the evening, I made a joke about how her feelings were overblown, and this led to a bit of a heated argument. Sarah snapped back that it was insensitive of me to not consider her dietary preferences when planning my birthday meal. I fired back that she could have spoken up earlier if it was such a big deal, and now she was ruining the celebration for everyone.

In the end, we both left the dinner feeling upset. I felt like I had done my part, and she felt like I had disregarded her. I know we were both in the wrong, but was I the asshole for wanting to enjoy my birthday meal the way I wanted?",708,1143,0.76,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_87743,2023-06-07 00:00:00,ESH,2014,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My friend and I have been close for years, and we often hang out with a bigger group. Recently, he started dating someone new, and while I'm happy for him, I've noticed that his girlfriend tends to dominate conversations and often interrupts others. 

Last weekend, we had a game night at my place, and things got a bit out of hand. She kept talking over people, dismissing their opinions, and making snarky comments whenever someone tried to share something. It was frustrating, and I felt like everyone else was getting pushed to the side.

At one point, I couldn't take it anymore. I jokingly said, ""Wow, [girlfriend's name], are you auditioning for a role in the next talk show? Because you're really stealing the spotlight!"" I meant it light-heartedly, but it came across harsher than I intended. The room went quiet, and she looked really hurt. My friend laughed awkwardly but didn’t say anything to defend her.

After the game night, I felt guilty for calling her out, but at the same time, I was frustrated with how our conversations were always getting derailed. I reached out to my friend later to apologize for my comment, but he said that I should just try to be more patient and that she’s just trying to fit in.

That didn’t sit well with me, and I ended up expressing my frustrations about her behavior in a group chat that included some of our friends. I thought we could all discuss it, but it turned into a huge argument. People were divided; some agreed with me, while others thought I was being rude and should have kept my mouth shut.

Now, my friend is upset with me for airing our personal issues in the group chat, and I can't help but feel frustrated that he isn't acknowledging how uncomfortable his girlfriend makes everyone.

As the night went on, I started making jokes and teasing both of them lightly. I thought we were all having fun, but I could see that Lisa was getting a little annoyed with me. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I might have pushed it too far when I made a comment about how Brian could do better than her. I meant it as a joke, but I could tell it hit a nerve. 

Brian laughed it off initially, but Lisa shot me a look that made it clear she didn’t appreciate it. Instead of backing off, I doubled down, thinking I was just being funny. I kept making jokes, not realizing how uncomfortable Lisa was getting. Eventually, she got up and left the room, and Brian followed her, looking upset.

After a few minutes, Brian came back alone and told me I had to stop crossing lines. He said I was being rude, and I needed to apologize. I felt taken aback because I thought we were just joking around, but I did apologize. Instead of acknowledging my apology, he just told me to leave because he was tired of my behavior.

I left feeling annoyed and confused. I called my other friends to vent, and they pointed out that maybe I should have been more aware of Lisa’s feelings. I get that I might have gone too far, but I still think Brian overreacted. Now I’m wondering if I should reach out to both of them to clear the air or just let it be.

Everyone sucks here,"I’ve been living with my girlfriend for about a year now, and overall, it’s been great. However, things got complicated when her younger brother, who’s 19, lost his job and needed a place to stay. My girlfriend insisted we let him move in temporarily. I initially agreed, thinking it would be for a month or so, but it’s been three months now, and he shows no signs of leaving.

The issue is that he’s really messy. He leaves his dirty dishes everywhere, doesn’t clean up after himself, and has a habit of playing video games at full volume late into the night. I tried talking to my girlfriend about it, expressing my frustration, but she just brushes it off and says he’s going through a tough time and we should be supportive. I get that, but it’s affecting my peace and comfort in our home.

One day, I snapped. I came home after a long day, and there were dirty dishes piled up in the kitchen and his gaming noise filling the living room. I lost my temper and told my girlfriend that her brother needed to either clean up after himself or find somewhere else to live. Instead of understanding, she got really upset with me, saying I was being insensitive to her brother’s situation.

In turn, I felt guilty for my outburst, but I also think she should have been more proactive in addressing the situation. Her brother overheard our argument and now feels like he’s unwelcome in our home, which wasn’t my intention at all. I’ve been trying to apologize to both of them, but the tension is still there.

Last weekend, we were all at a mutual friend’s party. I was chatting with some people when I overheard Jake making a dismissive comment about one of Emma’s interests. I felt it was pretty disrespectful, so I decided to confront him. I approached him and said something like, “You know, it’s really uncool to talk down to Emma about what she loves.” He rolled his eyes and brushed me off, saying I was just trying to cause drama.

Feeling frustrated, I went back to Emma and told her what happened. I wanted her to know that I had her back, but she got really upset with me for getting involved. She said I should have just let it go and that I was making things awkward. I defended myself, saying I was just trying to stand up for her, but she ended up storming off to find Jake.

Later that night, I confronted Emma again, and we ended up having a heated argument. I told her I didn't appreciate how she was letting him treat her, and she accused me of trying to control her life. It got pretty emotional, and now she’s not talking to me. 

I feel bad for getting involved but also feel like I did the right thing by standing up for my friend. I just didn’t expect it to blow up like this.

I didn’t think much of it at first, but then I overheard a conversation between them. Jake was making some pretty inappropriate jokes, and it felt like he was crossing a line. I thought it was disrespectful not just to Sarah but to me as her friend, especially since I’ve had a crush on her for a while now.

So, I confronted Jake about it. I told him he needed to back off because Sarah wasn’t interested and that his jokes were out of line. He laughed it off and said I was being too serious, which just made me angrier. I felt like I was standing up for my friend, but I also didn’t handle it well. Instead of just talking to Sarah about my feelings, I ended up making a scene and turning the whole situation awkward.

After that, Sarah pulled me aside and told me I shouldn’t have confronted Jake like that. She felt embarrassed and thought I was trying to control her relationships. I tried to explain my side, but it only led to a bigger argument between us. In the heat of the moment, I told her it was clear she didn’t value our friendship if she was okay with how Jake was acting.

Now, Sarah is upset with me, and Jake is making it awkward for the whole group. I feel bad for how I reacted, but I also think Jake was out of line. It’s all a mess, and I don’t know how to fix it.

When it was my turn to cook, I went all out and made a homemade lasagna with a salad and some garlic bread. I was really proud of the meal and wanted it to be special. However, one of my friends, Sarah (30F), who is known for her culinary skills, decided to bring a store-bought rotisserie chicken and a bag of chips. I felt disappointed because it seemed like she put in very little effort compared to what I had done.

During dinner, I made a light-hearted joke about how I was expecting something fancier from the “chef” of the group. Sarah laughed it off initially, but I noticed she looked a bit hurt. As the night went on, the conversation flowed, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I had crossed a line.

Later, in a private chat, Sarah told me she felt belittled by my comment. She explained that she had a really busy week and didn't have the time to cook. I apologized for my comment, but also explained that I felt let down because I had put so much effort into my dish. This turned into a back-and-forth where we both ended up feeling defensive.

Recently, Jake started dating a girl named Sarah. I hadn’t met her yet, but he seemed really happy, so I was excited for him.

Last week, Jake invited me to join them for dinner at a restaurant. I was looking forward to it, but when I arrived, I immediately felt awkward. Sarah was nice enough, but I could tell she was a bit stand-offish. Throughout dinner, she kept making comments about how Jake had changed since he started dating her, and it felt like she was subtly implying that I was a bad influence on him. 

At one point, she accused me of being too attached to Jake and said that it was unhealthy for him to have such a close friendship with me now that he was in a relationship. I felt defensive and pointed out that I’ve been in his life long before she came around. The conversation escalated, and I ended up saying something like, ""You don't get to dictate who he can be friends with just because you’re dating him."" 

After the dinner, Jake expressed that he was uncomfortable with how things played out. I felt really bad and apologized to him, but I also think Sarah was being unreasonable. I honestly believe I was just trying to defend our friendship.

I come from a background where I was always encouraged to be direct and honest in my feedback. So, I started sharing my thoughts openly during our meetings, trying to point out areas where I felt we could improve.

I talked to my girlfriend about it, expressing that I feel like it’s putting a strain on our space and relationship.

In retaliation, I stopped cleaning up after myself as meticulously as I normally would. If she didn’t want me to touch her things, I figured I wouldn’t be overly concerned about cleaning my own stuff either. So the cycle of dirty dishes continued, and the kitchen became a mess.

I don’t think anyone will eat them.” I felt a bit deflated but tried to brush it off.

Instead of backing me up, Alex said I was making too big of a deal out of it and that we should just let her be a teenager.

Last week, during a family dinner, my sister was sharing another story about her wedding planning, and I snapped. I told her that not everything should revolve around her wedding and that she should consider how that affects others, especially me. It wasn’t fair that she seemed to only care about herself.

My sister got really upset and accused me of being jealous. I immediately regretted my words and apologized, but the damage was done. Now, she’s not speaking to me, and our parents are upset with me for ruining the dinner.

I feel like I was wrong to lash out, but at the same time, I’m frustrated that I feel invisible in my own family. So, AITA for expressing my feelings, or was I out of line? 

EDIT: I realize that both my sister and I are at fault here. She’s wrapped up in her wedding, and I shouldn’t have let my frustrations boil over.

Everyone sucks here,"AITA for exposing my roommate for cheating after he threw a party without telling me? 

So, I (25M) share an apartment with my roommate, Jake (26M). We’ve been living together for about a year and generally get along well. However, we have a bit of a tension problem when it comes to communication. Jake tends to be the kind of guy who just does whatever he wants without discussing it with me first, which annoys me, but I try to let it slide.

Last week, Jake decided to throw a pretty big party at our place without even mentioning it to me. I found out when I came home from work and the place was packed with people I didn’t know, loud music blasting, and drinks everywhere. I was exhausted and just wanted to relax after a long day, but instead, I was met with chaos. I tried to stay cool about it at first, but as the night went on, I got increasingly frustrated with the lack of respect for my space.

In the midst of all that, I overheard Jake in a corner with another guy, bragging about how he was ""playing the field"" and “keeping his options open” regarding his girlfriend, who I knew was out of town. I couldn’t believe he was talking about cheating so openly while she was away. I thought it was completely unfair to her.

After the party, I was so upset about the whole situation that I messaged his girlfriend (who I’ve met a few times) and told her about what I heard. I felt it was the right thing to do, considering she deserves to know the truth. She was understandably hurt and upset, and I felt bad for her, but I also thought I was doing the right thing.

When Jake found out I told her, he was furious. He called me all sorts of names and accused me of being a snitch and not looking out for our friendship. He said I should’ve just confronted him about it instead of going behind his back. I told him I felt like it was necessary to tell her because he was being dishonest.

Now, I’m feeling a little guilty about the whole situation. I didn’t want to ruin his relationship, but I also felt a moral obligation to let her know. Looking back, maybe I could’ve handled it differently, but I also think Jake should have respected me enough to communicate about the party instead of treating it like it didn’t matter.

So, AITA for exposing my roommate for cheating after he threw a party without telling me?",307,1224,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_22527,2020-09-02 00:00:00,ESH,2328,AITA

Recently, Alex has been going through a rough patch, dealing with job loss and a breakup. I’ve tried to be there for him, but I've also been busy with my own job and personal life.

Last week, I was out with some mutual friends for a birthday celebration, and I shared a funny story about how I accidentally spilled coffee all over a presentation I was doing at work. It was light-hearted and everyone laughed, but when I looked over at Alex, he was silent and seemed really upset. Later in the night, he confronted me about it, saying I was insensitive for making jokes when he was struggling so much.

In the heat of the moment, I snapped and told him that maybe he needed to lighten up and not take things so seriously. I reminded him that I’m also going through my own stuff and that it wasn’t fair for him to expect me to tiptoe around his feelings all the time. Things escalated, and we ended up arguing in front of our friends, which was really awkward for everyone.

A few days later, we had a talk, and he pointed out that I was being dismissive of his feelings, and I felt like he was being too dramatic about my story. We both ended the conversation feeling hurt, and I’m not sure how to move forward.

After a particularly rough week where I barely got any sleep, I snapped. One night, I decided to blast my own music at the same volume right back at him. I figured if he could keep me up, I could do the same to him. It turned into a mini music battle that lasted for a couple of hours. 

The next day, he stormed over to my apartment, furious, and we ended up shouting at each other. I realize that my reaction was probably too extreme, but I felt desperate and frustrated.

I’m in 11th grade, and there's this guy, Jake, who’s been kind of a bully to me and some of my friends. He always cracks jokes at our expense, usually in front of others, and it's really frustrating. 

Last week at school, during lunch, my friends and I were sitting at our usual table. Jake came over with his buddies and started making fun of me, calling me “the loser of the group.” I tried to ignore it, but my friends were getting annoyed too. 

After a while, I decided I’d had enough. I remembered that Jake had a secret crush on a girl in our class, and I thought it would be funny to use that against him. So, I jokingly yelled out to the girl, saying, “Hey, Jake thinks you’re super cute! He talks about you all the time!” Everyone at the table laughed, including my friends, and Jake got really embarrassed. It felt good in the moment because he finally got a taste of his own medicine.

But then, after lunch, I found out that Jake was really upset about it. He confronted me later, saying I crossed a line and that I should apologize. I felt bad because I didn’t mean to hurt him like that, but I also felt like he deserved it for all the times he made fun of me. I ended up telling him that I wouldn’t apologize because he should know how it feels to be humiliated.

Everyone sucks here,"Last weekend, I decided to host a small gathering at my apartment to celebrate my birthday. I invited a few close friends, and everyone seemed excited about it. I had planned snacks, drinks, and some games to keep the atmosphere lively.

As the night went on, one of my friends, Sarah, started to get a bit too tipsy. She was laughing and joking, but then she began to make some off-color jokes that made a few people uncomfortable. I brushed it off at first, thinking everyone was having fun, but it started to escalate. She began to poke fun at another friend, Mark, who is more reserved and doesn't take jokes well.

When Sarah made a particularly harsh comment about Mark’s appearance, I felt it crossed the line. Instead of addressing it calmly, I snapped at her and told her to “shut up and grow up” in front of everyone. The room went silent, and Sarah looked taken aback. I felt bad for how I reacted, but I was also doing my best to defend Mark and maintain the mood of the gathering.

Things got awkward after that. Mark thanked me for standing up for him, but Sarah immediately left, saying she didn’t want to be around “judgmental people.” A couple of friends followed her out, trying to comfort her, while I stayed back with Mark and a few others who just wanted to enjoy the rest of the night.

Everyone sucks here,"My friend and I have been roommates for the past two years. We get along well most of the time, but lately, there have been some tensions. I work a stable job that pays the bills, but it isn’t glamorous. My friend, on the other hand, is an aspiring musician and spends almost all his time working on his music, which he dreams will take off one day.

For the past few months, I’ve been picking up extra shifts to save for a trip we’ve both talked about taking together. I thought it would be a great way to bond, and it’s something we both need—a break from our daily grind. I even mentioned how much fun it would be to explore new places together.

However, my friend has been making comments that really irritate me. He keeps saying things like, “You’re working too much; you need to live a little!” or “Don’t get too comfortable in your job; it’s a dead end!” I feel like he’s belittling my hard work and commitment to our living situation. I get that following your passion is important, but I also think being responsible matters.

Last week, things came to a head when he missed paying his part of the rent again. I confronted him about it, and we ended up in a heated argument. He accused me of being closed-minded and not supporting his dreams, while I told him he needed to step up and take responsibility for his part. 

In a moment of frustration, I told him that if he really cared about our friendship, he’d prioritize our living situation over his music. He responded by saying I was suffocating him and that he doesn’t want to be held back by my “normal life.” 

Now we’re both upset, and it’s created a lot of tension in our home. I feel like I’m justified in wanting him to contribute, but I also realize I might have come off as harsh.

Everyone sucks here,"Okay, so I’m new to Reddit and I’m not sure if I’m doing this right, but I really need some perspective on a situation that happened recently. 

So, I (27F) have a younger brother, Jake (24M), who has been dating his girlfriend, Mia (23F), for about six months now. I’ve been trying to be supportive and welcoming to her, but I’ve noticed that she can be a bit overbearing. For instance, she constantly tries to change our family traditions when she’s around, which annoys me a bit. 

For Thanksgiving, our family has this tradition where we all gather and share what we’re grateful for before eating. When Mia found out about this, she suggested we do a gratitude jar instead—everyone writes something down and puts it in the jar, and then we read them aloud at the end. I wasn’t a fan of this idea, but I didn’t want to create a scene, so I reluctantly agreed.

The day of Thanksgiving came, and Mia was super excited about the jar, going around and reminding everyone to participate. When it was finally time to read them, I was a bit put off because half of the things in the jar were kind of silly, like “I’m thankful for pizza.” I made a sarcastic comment about how some people really need to take gratitude seriously. Mia got upset and said I was ruining the spirit of the day. 

In response, I pointed out that she was the one trying to change a cherished family tradition, and if she wanted to do her own thing, she should have just done it separately instead of forcing it on all of us. Things got heated, and eventually, both Mia and I ended up storming off. Jake is now caught in the middle, and he’s been upset with me for how I handled it.

Now, I feel bad for escalating things, but I also think Mia was out of line for trying to change our tradition so drastically. So, AITA for reacting the way I did to Mia on Thanksgiving?",877,1253,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_28346,2022-12-06 00:00:00,ESH,1841,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Okay, so I'm in my final year of high school, and there's this ongoing rivalry between me and a classmate named Jake. It all started at the beginning of the year when we both tried out for the same position on the debate team. I ended up getting the spot, and Jake was really upset about it. Ever since then, he’s made it a point to rub it in my face every chance he gets, whether it’s during class discussions or even in front of our friends.

Fast forward to last week, we had a big group project for our history class. The teacher split us into pairs, and guess who I got paired with? Jake. I was really not looking forward to working with him, but I figured we could at least put our differences aside for the sake of our grades.

As we started working on the project, I noticed that Jake was not pulling his weight at all. He barely contributed anything and kept insisting that I do the majority of the work. Frustrated, I decided to do what I could to get back at him. So, I purposefully misled him about some of the key points we needed to cover. I told him that certain topics were crucial to our project when they weren't, and I also gave him incorrect information to work from.

When the day of the presentation came, Jake confidently presented the wrong information, while I played it off as if I had no idea he was going off track. The teacher caught on quickly and ended up giving us a low grade because of the inaccuracies. Jake was furious with me and accused me of sabotaging him, which honestly, was a little true. 

I feel like we both acted poorly—he didn’t do his part, and I stooped to his level to get back at him. So, am I the asshole for trying to sabotage his part of the project, or are we both in the wrong here?",187,2455,0.78,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_19877,2022-07-29 00:00:00,ESH,1739,AITA

I was taken aback since I never saw him in that way and was still healing from a recent breakup. I told him I appreciated his honesty but that I wasn’t interested in dating anyone right now.

He seemed understanding, but I could tell he was a bit disappointed. The day of the party, Jake showed up with a gift and was overly affectionate, which made me a bit uncomfortable, but I brushed it off because I didn’t want to ruin the mood. As the night went on, he kept trying to pull me aside for private conversations, which was awkward since I was trying to socialize with other friends.

At one point, he cornered me and asked if I was sure I didn’t want to give him a chance. I reiterated that I just wasn't ready to date anyone yet. He got upset, saying he had been patient and supportive with me during my breakup and felt like I was leading him on by inviting him to the party. I was taken aback by this accusation and insisted that I wasn’t leading him on; I just wanted to be friends.

Eventually, things got heated, and I told him that he was being selfish for putting me in this position at my own birthday party. He stormed off, and later that night, I found out he was telling other coworkers how I had been stringing him along and how I was a terrible person for not reciprocating his feelings.

Around six months ago, J decided he wanted to take on more cooking responsibilities at home. I was thrilled at first because I love to cook, but it was also nice to share the load. However, I noticed that J started using all my favorite cookware and kitchen gadgets without asking. At first, I thought it was fine since we live together, but it started to bother me after a while.

One day, I discovered that he had accidentally scratched my favorite non-stick frying pan while trying to cook. I was upset, and when I mentioned it to him, he shrugged it off and said, “It’s just a pan.” I felt like he didn’t respect my belongings. So, I started to express my feelings more directly. I would ask him to please ask before using my specific pots and pans, and I pointed out which ones I’d like to keep just for myself.

My tone would sometimes get frustrated, and I realized that I was being a bit harsh in my delivery. But I felt like I was walking on eggshells, and it stressed me out when he didn’t respect my boundaries.

Everything was going well until a family set up a barbecue right next to us, which I initially thought was fine. But then, as they started grilling, the smoke began to drift over onto our picnic area. It wasn't just a little smoke; it was enough that I could barely enjoy the food I had brought.

I politely asked them if they could move their grill a bit further away or at least try to minimize the smoke, explaining that we were trying to enjoy our picnic. The dad, who seemed to be in his late 30s, got defensive and said they had been there first and that we were just being overly sensitive. I felt frustrated and, to be honest, a bit entitled myself. 

I snapped back, saying something like, ""Just because you got here first doesn't mean you can ruin everyone else's day."" The conversation escalated, and soon we were both shouting at each other. I could tell his kids were embarrassed, and my friends were trying to calm me down, which honestly just made me more annoyed.

One of my friends, Alex, has been going through a tough time recently, and I wanted to make sure he felt included and welcomed. However, he showed up pretty late and clearly drank a bit too much before arriving. It was awkward because he was loud and kind of dominating the conversation, making it hard for others to get a word in. 

At one point, he made a really inappropriate joke about another friend, Mia, who had just shared a personal story about her struggles with her anxiety. I felt like it was a real low point and called him out on it. I told him he was being disrespectful and that he needed to chill out. He got defensive and started yelling back, saying I was being overly sensitive and that everyone else was laughing too.

Things escalated, and I ended up kicking him out of my house because he refused to apologize. After he left, the atmosphere was really tense, and a few people expressed that I was too harsh on him. I felt conflicted because I genuinely wanted to stand up for Mia but also didn't want to ruin the night for everyone else.

In the end, I think we all overreacted in some way. So, am I the asshole here?",644,2719,0.66,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_57366,2021-07-10 00:00:00,ESH,1341,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I recently had a falling out with my neighbor, and I’m not sure if I handled it well. 

We live in a pretty close-knit community, and everyone generally gets along. Recently, my neighbor, let’s call him Dave, threw a big party for his birthday. He invited a bunch of people over, and as the night went on, it got really loud. I get that it’s a celebration, but it went on until nearly 2 AM. My kids were trying to sleep, and I was getting really frustrated.

I decided to go over and ask them to keep the noise down. When I got there, I found that they were all pretty drunk and not really in a mood to listen. I asked Dave politely to lower the volume, but he laughed it off and said it was his party and they’d keep going as long as they wanted. I felt a bit embarrassed but pushed on, telling him that it was late and my kids needed to rest.

After a little back-and-forth, I ended up raising my voice a bit. I said something like, “This isn’t a nightclub, it’s a neighborhood! Have some respect!” I felt bad for losing my cool, but I was really worn out from the noise.

Dave didn’t take it well, and he told me I was being a buzzkill and should lighten up. Some of his friends started to chime in, calling me names and saying I was ruining the fun. I left feeling upset, and I thought about it all night. 

The next day, I decided to bake some cookies and bring them over as a peace offering. When I got to his door, he opened it and looked at me like I was crazy for even attempting to apologize. I cracked a joke about how I was ""hoping to bribe him with baked goods,"" but he just shut the door in my face.

Now I’m wondering if I overreacted by yelling, or if I was justified considering the noise. It’s been awkward since then, and I feel like I made things worse. So, am I the asshole here?",131,2582,0.81,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_33033,2024-06-08 00:00:00,ESH,1800,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My cousin is having a baby shower next month, and I was really looking forward to it. I love my cousin, and I think it's exciting that she's starting a family. However, I just found out that the baby shower is being held on a Saturday afternoon, and it's scheduled to last for about four hours. 

The issue is that I have a long-standing commitment to volunteer at a local animal shelter on Saturdays, which I've been doing for over a year. I'm really passionate about it, and I feel responsible for being there, especially since I signed up to help with a special adoption event that day. I already confirmed my attendance for the shelter event, and I can't really back out last minute without letting people down.

I talked to my cousin and explained the situation. I offered to come by the baby shower for the last hour or so after my volunteering shift ends. I thought this would be a good compromise since I want to celebrate her new baby, but she was really upset. She said that the shower is a special time for everyone to gather and that it won't be the same without me there for the whole thing. 

Now I’m feeling torn. I want to support my cousin and celebrate her, but I also don’t want to abandon my commitment to the shelter. I feel like I'm being pulled in two directions and that neither of us is being particularly understanding.

Everyone sucks here,"Sorry for any formatting issues, I’m on mobile.

So, I (29M) have been friends with ""Jake"" (30M) for about 10 years. Recently, we both started dating people seriously. I’m in a relationship with “Sara” (28F), while Jake is dating “Emily” (29F). We all get along quite well, and we often hang out together.

Here’s the issue. A few weeks ago, during a group dinner, Jake made a comment about how “Emily is the best girlfriend ever” and went on to list all the things she does for him. At first, it seemed sweet, but it turned uncomfortable when he started comparing Emily to Sara, saying things like, “Emily would never let me leave my dirty dishes in the sink!” 

I found this really annoying and felt that he was undermining my relationship. I brushed it off initially, but as the night went on, he kept making little comments that subtly put down Sara. I couldn’t hold back anymore, and I snapped at him, saying something like, “Well, if you think Emily is so perfect, maybe you should just marry her and leave the rest of us alone.” 

Jake looked taken aback, and the mood shifted. Emily looked embarrassed, and Sara seemed upset that I had escalated things. After that, Jake got quiet and didn’t say much for the rest of the night. Later, he told me I was an asshole for ruining a fun evening and for being disrespectful to his relationship. I felt bad and tried to apologize, but he’s still pretty upset with me.

Now, I feel conflicted. I know I shouldn’t have snapped like that, but I also felt justified in standing up for my partner. I talked to Sara about it, and she thinks I overreacted too, but she also agreed that Jake’s comments were out of line. 

So, am I the asshole here? I honestly don’t know if I crossed a line or if Jake was being insensitive.",303,2718,0.7,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_66496,2023-08-01 00:00:00,ESH,1767,AITA

I recently got a promotion at work, which I was really excited about. I shared this news with Jake, expecting him to be happy for me, but instead, he made a snarky comment about how I “must be kissing up to the boss” to get ahead. I brushed it off, but it stung a little.

A week later, I invited him to a small celebration dinner with some other friends. Jake showed up late and a little drunk, which was pretty typical for him, but he ended up making another comment about how the promotion wouldn’t last and that I probably wouldn’t be able to handle the extra responsibility. I snapped at him, telling him that maybe he should focus on his own life instead of putting me down.

Things escalated, and we ended up arguing in front of everyone. I felt bad afterward, but it seemed like Jake didn’t want to back down either. In the heat of the moment, I told him that if he couldn’t be supportive, he didn’t have to be part of my life anymore. He stormed off, and later I found out he told some mutual friends that I was being arrogant and unsupportive of him.

Now, I’ve been feeling guilty about how I handled it, but also frustrated that Jake couldn't just be happy for me.

I usually handle most of the chores, like cleaning the kitchen and taking out the trash, while my roommate primarily does laundry and dishes. A couple of weeks ago, I noticed the kitchen was getting messier, and the trash hadn’t been taken out in days. When I brought it up, my roommate just shrugged it off, saying they were busy with work and that I should just clean it if it bothered me.

I was frustrated and pointed out that we both contribute to the mess, and it’s unfair for me to shoulder the majority of the cleaning, especially when I’m already stressed out with my job. Instead of acknowledging my feelings, my roommate got defensive and accused me of being overly critical and controlling.

In the heat of the moment, I called them lazy and said that I was tired of always having to pick up after them. They snapped back that I was acting entitled and that they were doing their share, even if it wasn’t in the way I expected. We both ended up yelling at each other, which escalated into a full-blown argument.

Afterward, I felt bad about how things went down, but I still believed I had a point about sharing responsibilities. I didn’t apologize, and now there’s a weird tension in the apartment.

Everyone sucks here,"So I need to vent about a recent situation that happened at a family gathering. My brother and his wife invited everyone over for a barbecue, and I was really looking forward to it. I usually get along well with my family, but there's always a bit of tension around my sister-in-law, who can be quite particular about things.

When I arrived, the food was already being prepared, and I saw my brother struggling to get the grill going. He was getting a bit flustered, and I thought I could help out. I offered to take over the grilling while he took a break, but my sister-in-law immediately jumped in and said, ""No offense, but I don't trust anyone else to grill my food."" I didn’t think it was that big of a deal, so I made a joke about how I was a pro at grilling and could probably do it with my eyes closed.

She rolled her eyes and said, ""Maybe stick to what you know."" I felt a bit humiliated, but I let it go and just grabbed a drink. Later, when we sat down to eat, I noticed her made a big deal about serving everyone the food she had meticulously prepared. When it was my turn, she handed me a burger and said, ""I hope you like it; I made it just the way I like it."" I felt like she was implying that my taste was inferior.

I couldn't help myself and responded, ""Thanks, but I prefer my burgers without a side of condescension."" Everyone went silent, and my brother looked frustrated. My sister-in-law shot me a glare, and we ended up having this awkward tension for the rest of the evening. I later overheard my brother telling her that I was being rude and that I should apologize, but I felt justified because she always has this air of superiority.

Now I feel like I may have escalated the situation and I’m not sure if I handled it right. So, AITA for saying what I did?

TL;DR: I tried to help with grilling at my brother's barbecue, but my sister-in-law didn't trust me to do it right and made a snarky comment about my grilling skills.

Lately, Alex’s brother, Tom, has been staying with us while he looks for a new job. Tom is a nice guy, but he can be pretty careless about things in the house. He often leaves the fridge open, and he has a habit of forgetting to close the bathroom door, which is a bit annoying.

Last week, I noticed that Max seemed a little off. He wasn’t eating well and seemed lethargic. I thought it might be because of the changes in our household with Tom around. I decided to keep a close eye on Max and noticed that Tom was giving him food whenever he thought I wasn’t looking. I was upset because I feed Max a specific diet due to some health issues.

One day, I came home and found Tom feeding Max a slice of pizza! I lost it and yelled at him to stop feeding my dog human food, especially junk food. Tom got defensive and said I was overreacting and that “Max looked like he was enjoying it.” We argued for a while, and I told him that if he couldn’t respect my rules for my dog, he needed to find somewhere else to stay.

Alex stepped in and said I was being too harsh on Tom, and that I could have just asked him to stop in a nicer way. I felt justified, but the whole situation spiraled out of control. Now, Tom is avoiding me, and Alex is caught in the middle, feeling like I overreacted.

Everyone sucks here,"I’m in a bit of a mess and could use some outside perspectives on this situation. My younger brother (19) has always been a bit of a troublemaker. He dropped out of high school a year ago and hasn’t really done much since—no job, no plans for the future. My parents are frustrated, but they keep coddling him, giving him money and letting him live at home without any real expectations.

Recently, he asked to borrow my car for a few days because his was in the shop. I reluctantly agreed, but told him to be responsible and return it with a full tank. Fast forward a couple of days, and I find out he not only drove it around without a license, but he also got into a minor accident. Thankfully, no one was hurt, but my car has a pretty noticeable dent now, and the insurance is going to cost me a lot to fix.

When I confronted him about it, he didn’t take it seriously. He laughed it off, saying it wasn’t a big deal and that I should just be glad he wasn’t hurt. I lost my temper and told him he was useless, that he never takes anything seriously and that he was ruining my life with his irresponsibility. I also said that if he can’t handle adult responsibilities, he should go live with our parents again. 

He got really upset and started crying, saying I was being harsh and that everyone makes mistakes. I’ll admit, I felt bad afterward, but I also feel like I’ve been pushed to my limit. It’s like he doesn’t care about anyone but himself. 

Now, I’m wondering if I overreacted, especially since he’s still my little brother. But I also think he needs a wake-up call. Am I the asshole for how I handled the situation? Or are we both just being unreasonable?",163,1618,0.58,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_78632,2021-12-29 00:00:00,ESH,1668,AITA

One night, after a particularly long day, I finally snapped and went over to her house to complain.

When I knocked on her door, she answered with a tired look on her face, as if she'd just put the kids to bed. I could tell she was overwhelmed, but I went on about how she needed to get her kids under control and that it was unfair for her to let them play out so late while others were trying to rest. I was loud, and I may have raised my voice a bit too much.

Lisa fired back, saying I had no right to dictate how she raised her kids and that I should be more understanding. She mentioned how hard it was to keep them entertained indoors and how they needed to burn off energy. In the heat of the moment, I said something like, ""Maybe you should think about a playpen if you can't control them!"" 

That really escalated things, and she got defensive, calling me a jerk and saying I was just a miserable person who didn't care about anyone but myself.

I'm in my late 20s and have a sister who is a few years older than me. She recently got engaged and is planning her wedding. She’s always been a bit of a perfectionist, and this wedding planning has turned her into an absolute whirlwind of stress. I’ve tried to help as much as I can, but honestly, I’m not great with the details and organization — I’m more of a go-with-the-flow person.

A few weeks ago, she invited me to a dress fitting and asked for my opinion. I was excited to be included, but when I saw the dress, I was taken aback. I thought it was pretty, but honestly, it just felt a little… over the top for her. I told her that while I thought she looked lovely, it didn’t quite match the vibe she usually has. I suggested she might want to consider something a bit simpler that reflects her personality more.

This set off a chain reaction. She got really upset, saying I was ruining her excitement and that I clearly didn’t understand how important this day was for her. I felt bad because I never meant to hurt her feelings, but I also thought I was just being honest. To make matters worse, during a heated discussion, I ended up snapping back, saying she was being dramatic and that it was just a dress.

Now, we haven’t spoken for a week, and I feel terrible about it. I tried to apologize, but she said she needs some space before she can talk to me. I honestly thought I was trying to help her, but maybe I was just being insensitive. I’m worried that I've created a rift in our relationship over something that should be joyful. 

So, AITA for giving my opinion on my sister's wedding dress and for how I reacted during the argument?",880,2780,0.63,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_70638,2020-05-28 00:00:00,ESH,1713,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I'm using a throwaway account because I don't want anyone to know who I am, but I need to get this off my chest. I (32F) have a younger brother (24M) who recently got engaged to his girlfriend (24F) after dating for about a year. My brother has always been a bit of a jokester, and he tends to make light of serious situations, which can be a bit grating at times.

Last week, we had a family dinner to celebrate their engagement. During dinner, my brother started making jokes about how ""lucky"" his fiancée was to be marrying into our family, including some off-color comments that were meant to be funny but felt pretty disrespectful to me and my parents. His fiancée laughed it off at first, but I could see she was uncomfortable, especially when he joked that she was ""upgrading"" from her previous relationships.

I finally snapped and told him that he needed to stop being so inappropriate and that his jokes were not funny. He got defensive and said I was ruining the mood and that he was just trying to lighten things up. The atmosphere became tense, and his fiancée looked visibly upset. My parents tried to diffuse the situation, but it didn't help much.

After dinner, my brother confronted me and said I embarrassed him in front of his fiancée and the family. I told him that he was being insensitive, and I felt it was necessary to speak up. Now, he isn’t talking to me, and I feel guilty for calling him out, but I also think he crossed a line. 

So, AITA for calling out my brother during his engagement dinner, or did he deserve it? I feel like we both made things awkward, and I don't know how to fix it.",988,886,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_61552,2020-02-14 00:00:00,ESH,1620,AITA

I was trying to enjoy myself, but the noise was overwhelming, particularly when the kids started playing a drinking game in the living room. I have a low tolerance for loud environments, and it felt like no one was even trying to control the situation. I asked my friend to keep it down, but she laughed it off, saying it was a party and everyone was having fun.

Feeling frustrated, I snapped and told her she was being irresponsible for letting it get out of control. She got defensive and accused me of being a buzzkill. In retaliation, I started making sarcastic comments about the party and how it was more like a frat house than a birthday celebration. This escalated tensions, and soon we were both arguing in front of everyone.

Eventually, her brother and his friends left, and the mood was completely ruined. I felt bad afterward because I didn't handle the situation well. I should have just left if it was that bothersome for me, but I also think my friend should have been more considerate of her guests’ comfort.

We had a solid friendship, bonded over gaming and movies, and it was all good until he started getting really close with my girlfriend, Sarah. At first, I thought it was just friendly, but then I noticed Mark was texting her constantly and hanging out with her one-on-one, which made me uncomfortable.

One day, I confronted Mark about it. I said, ""Look, man, I don’t know what you’re trying to do, but it’s kind of weird that you’re spending so much time with Sarah. She's my girlfriend, not just your friend."" He got defensive and said he was just being friendly and that I was overreacting. I felt my blood boil and snapped back, “You’re just a loser who can’t get a girlfriend on his own, so you’re trying to steal mine!”

That really escalated things. Mark got hurt and said I was being a terrible friend, and that if I couldn’t trust him, maybe I shouldn’t be with Sarah. I felt guilty afterward and realized I was probably too harsh. But honestly, I was just trying to protect my relationship. 

A week later, I went to apologize to Mark, but he was still upset and wouldn’t talk to me. I also talked to Sarah about it, and she said she didn’t appreciate me coming at Mark like that, and that I should have just communicated my feelings without being rude.

My friend Sarah (24F) and I (25M) have been best friends since high school. We share a lot of interests, including a love for gaming and movies. Recently, Sarah started dating this guy, Jake (26M), and while I was happy for her, I noticed that she began to change. She started canceling our plans to spend time with him, which is understandable to an extent, but I felt like I was being pushed aside.

One night, Sarah invited me to watch a new movie that had just come out. I was really looking forward to it since we used to have regular movie nights, but when I arrived, Jake was there too. I felt a little left out since they were all over each other and hardly paying attention to the movie. I tried to engage with them, but it was clear they were more interested in each other.

Feeling frustrated, I joked around about how her new boyfriend was stealing her away from me, saying something like, ""Looks like Jake is your new best friend now!"" I thought it would lighten the mood, but instead, Sarah got really defensive and told me that I was being immature and jealous. I felt hurt because I genuinely just missed our friendship.

In the heat of the moment, I snapped and called Jake a “loser” for not letting us have our time together as friends. Sarah got really upset and kicked me out of her apartment, saying she needed to think about our friendship.

Now I feel bad for how I reacted, but I also think Sarah should have communicated better instead of just shutting me out. So, AITA for calling her boyfriend a loser and expressing my frustration? Or was my reaction justified? I guess I’m wondering if we’re both being unreasonable in this situation.",224,2039,0.69,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_48216,2023-04-10 00:00:00,ESH,1752,AITA

Mia has been struggling financially and asked to borrow some money from me for her rent. I agreed to lend her the money but made it clear that I wouldn’t be able to help her again if she needed it. She was very grateful, and I thought that would be the end of it.

A few weeks later, I noticed that she was posting pictures on social media of her going out to expensive restaurants and having a good time, which really bothered me. I felt like if she could afford to go out and enjoy herself, she shouldn’t have borrowed money from me. So, I confronted her about it. I made a comment about how it was funny she could afford sushi but couldn’t pay her rent. 

Mia was hurt and told me I was being judgmental and didn’t understand her situation. She explained that she was trying to enjoy life and distract herself from her financial stress, but I couldn't help but feel betrayed. Instead of just dropping it, I kept pressing her about how she should prioritize her finances better.

Feeling defensive, Mia then lashed out at me, pointing out how I sometimes spend money on things I don't need, like my new phone or going out with other friends. It was a low blow, and I felt like she was being hypocritical since I was trying to help her. 

We both ended up yelling at each other and made hurtful comments. Afterward, we didn’t talk for a few days, and it really affected me. I realized we both handled the situation poorly, but I still feel justified in being upset about her spending habits while asking for help.

Recently, I got a promotion at work, which comes with a significant pay raise. I was really excited about it and decided to treat myself to a little vacation for the first time in years. I booked a trip to the beach for a week and planned everything out, ensuring I could fully relax.

A few days before I was set to leave, Jake asked if he could crash at my place for the week while I was gone, as he had been evicted from his apartment. I felt bad saying no, but I explained that I had planned this trip for myself and needed the space to unwind without any distractions. He got upset and insisted that I should be willing to share my space and help him out, given what he was going through.

I felt guilty but stuck to my decision. I told him I couldn't be responsible for his housing situation when I had made this commitment to myself. I even offered to help him find a temporary place to stay or stay with our parents, but he didn’t want to do that. He ended up staying at a friend’s house for the week, but he was clearly upset with me.

I (26M) have a close-knit group of friends I've known since high school, and we often hang out on weekends. Recently, my friend Mark (27M) has been in a difficult spot. He lost his job a few months back and has been struggling to find a new one. He’s been staying with his parents, but they aren’t very supportive and often put pressure on him. I’ve been trying to cheer him up and help him during this tough time.

While we’ve been hanging out, I noticed that he hasn’t been taking care of himself very well. He doesn’t dress nicely anymore, and he’s let himself go a bit. I’ve tried to be supportive, but I also feel like he’s become a bit of a downer. He often talks about his problems and how life isn't fair, which can put a damper on our hangouts with the rest of the group.

One weekend, I planned a big get-together at my place. I wanted it to be fun and light-hearted, so I invited a bunch of friends and set up some games and snacks. When Mark arrived, he seemed particularly down. I tried to lift his spirits, but he just kept sulking. After a while, I jokingly said something like, “Come on, man, you need to get it together. We can't have you looking like you just rolled out of bed at a party!” Everyone laughed, but Mark didn't take it well. He went quiet and left shortly after.

I (28F) live with my partner (30M) and his two kids (8 and 10) every other weekend. The kids are great, and we generally have a lot of fun together. I've always been a big believer in teaching kids responsibility, especially when it comes to chores and taking care of their things.

Recently, the kids decided they wanted a puppy. My partner was on board, and while I was a bit hesitant due to the added responsibility, I ultimately went along with it. The kids were so excited, and we all agreed that they would have to help take care of the puppy—feeding, walking, and cleaning up after it.

Fast forward to a few weeks later, and it became clear that the kids were not stepping up. They would forget to feed the puppy, and I found myself taking on most of the responsibilities. I was getting frustrated, especially since I have my own job and responsibilities to manage.

One day, I came home from work and found the puppy had chewed up a lot of my things because it was left alone for too long. I lost my temper and yelled at the kids for not taking care of the puppy as they promised. They ended up crying, and my partner got upset with me for how I handled it. I felt guilty afterward because I know they were just kids and didn't mean to cause harm, but I was overwhelmed.

Later that week, I suggested to my partner that we should consider finding a new home for the puppy. He was against it, insisting that the kids needed more time to learn responsibility. I kept pushing the idea, feeling like it was the right thing to do for the puppy's well-being. Eventually, I searched for a new home for the puppy behind my partner's back and found someone who was thrilled to adopt him.

They exchanged a few words and then one of them replied, “We’re just having fun, chill out.” I felt my face flush with embarrassment but also anger. I shot back, “It’s a coffee shop, not a club. You can have fun without being a nuisance!” At this point, they became more vocal, insisting that they were just enjoying their time and that I should relax.

My next move was petty; I turned up the volume on my laptop and started playing some music to drown them out.

They invited me to join their workout sessions, and I was thrilled to find a sense of community.

One day, during a group workout, I noticed that they were all talking about an upcoming fitness competition in the area. Everyone seemed really excited, and they started discussing their strategies for succeeding in it. I jokingly mentioned that maybe they should all just take steroids to gain an edge, trying to lighten the mood. The group went quiet, and I immediately realized my comment fell flat. 

Feeling embarrassed, I laughed it off and made a couple of other light jokes about how I would just show up and embarrass myself. However, one of the members, Mia, looked really upset. She later pulled me aside after the workout and told me that she had struggled with body image issues and that my comment was really hurtful. I was caught off guard, and instead of apologizing, I tried to defend my joke, saying I didn’t mean anything by it and that it was just a joke. I felt frustrated because I genuinely didn't think it was a big deal.

Everything was going smoothly until a couple of weeks later when I had a huge argument with my roommate, who is also a close friend.

My roommate has been dealing with a lot of personal issues and has been super stressed out. During our fight, I made some hurtful comments about how she's always a downer and how her negativity affects everyone around her. Honestly, I was frustrated and didn’t think she would take it so hard, but it ended up escalating into a huge blowout. She started crying and said I was being unsupportive and selfish, and I got defensive, insisting I was just looking out for her.

After that fight, I felt bad but didn’t reach out to her right away because I was still upset. Meanwhile, C started to plan her bridal shower and asked me about the guest list. I suggested including my roommate, thinking it would be a good opportunity for them to mend things. C hesitated and eventually told me she didn’t want my roommate there because she was “too much drama” and was worried it would spoil the fun. I was taken aback, but I kept quiet, thinking maybe C was right.

As the bridal shower approached, I decided to invite my roommate anyway, thinking she could use a fun distraction. I mentioned it to C, and she flipped out, saying I was undermining her plans and being inconsiderate of her feelings. I was really hurt because I thought I was doing the right thing, but now it felt like I was caught in the middle.

On the day of the shower, things got even worse. My roommate showed up, and C was visibly upset. They ended up having a confrontation where my roommate called C a “fake friend” for not being supportive of me. It turned into a massive argument, and I felt stuck. I tried to mediate, but it only escalated.

After that, C told me she didn’t want me to be a bridesmaid anymore and accused me of choosing my roommate over her.

Everyone sucks here,"I (31M) recently got into a heated disagreement with my partner, Emily (30F), over how we should handle our pet dog, Max. We adopted him a couple of years ago, and he’s been a huge part of our lives. However, things have changed a bit since then. 

Emily and I have both been working from home, but she recently got a new job that requires her to be in the office three days a week. I still work remotely full-time, so I've taken on most of the responsibility for taking care of Max, including walking him, feeding him, and keeping him entertained. While I love the little guy, it’s been exhausting managing all of this on my own.

Last week, Emily came home and told me that she was thinking of getting a second dog because she felt Max was lonely. I immediately expressed my concerns about the additional responsibility and the fact that I was already struggling to keep up with Max. I suggested that we should focus on making sure we can properly care for one dog before adding another to the mix. Emily got really defensive and accused me of not wanting to expand our family. 

In the heat of the moment, I snapped and said that she was being selfish for wanting another dog when I was already feeling overwhelmed. I also brought up how she would be at the office for most of the week, leaving me to deal with both dogs on my own. This led to a huge argument, and she stormed off to her mom's place for the night.

After some time apart, I realized that I might have been too harsh in my response. I could have approached the conversation differently and expressed my concerns without being so accusatory. However, I also feel like Emily was being unrealistic about the situation and not fully considering the challenges we were currently facing.

So a few weeks ago, I had a work project that required me to stay late at the office. It was a stressful week, and my coworker Sarah, who I've always gotten along with, was also there late working on her own project. We started chatting to relieve some of the tension, and eventually, we both ended up venting about our personal lives.

During our conversation, Sarah mentioned that she was having a rough time with her roommate and was considering finding a new place. I offered her a spare room in my apartment since I had an extra room and figured it could help both of us out. I thought it was a generous offer since we were both stressed from work, and I wanted to lend a hand. She seemed grateful and said she’d think about it.

Later that week, she asked if she could come over to discuss the details. I agreed, thinking it was all quite innocent. When she came over, we ended up having a few drinks and talking for hours. The conversation turned a bit flirty, and by the end of the night, we shared a kiss. I immediately felt guilty and pulled away, but it was clear that both of us were attracted to each other.

I texted my boyfriend later that night, telling him about Sarah coming over and our conversation. He was not happy. He accused me of leading her on and putting myself in a situation that could have been avoided. I tried to explain that my intentions were just to help her out, but he was convinced that I had crossed a line.

To make matters worse, Sarah's roommate found out about the kiss and confronted her, leading to a big fight between them. Sarah ended up feeling embarrassed and hurt, and I felt terrible for putting her in that position. My boyfriend and I ended up arguing about it for days, as he felt I was being too friendly and reckless.

I eventually decided it would be best to back out of the offer to have Sarah stay with me to avoid any further complications. I texted her to explain that I didn’t want to make things awkward and that she should find a place with someone else. Sarah was disappointed and said she understood, but I could tell she felt let down. 

Now, I'm feeling guilty for both hurting Sarah and causing tension with my boyfriend. A part of me thinks I was just trying to be a good person, but I also realize I shouldn’t have let things get as flirty as they did. 

So, Reddit, am I the asshole?

Everyone sucks here,"So, my girlfriend (26) and I (27) have been together for three years. Recently, we decided to take a trip to visit her parents, who live a couple of hours away. I’ve always gotten along with them, but there’s always been this underlying tension, especially with her dad. He’s a bit traditional and has made comments about how I don’t “measure up” in terms of career. 

During our visit, her dad started making some passive-aggressive remarks about my job, which is in the arts. I felt my temper rising but tried to keep my cool. However, after a few drinks during dinner, I let my frustrations get the better of me. I snapped and told him that he wouldn't know talent if it hit him in the face and that he’s living in the past with his outdated views on what success looks like.

The atmosphere turned icy, and my girlfriend was mortified. We ended up leaving shortly after, and she was upset with me for ruining the visit. I felt justified in standing up for myself, but I also realized that I completely overreacted in front of her family. When we got back home, I tried to apologize and express that I was just defending myself, but she said I need to learn how to handle criticism more gracefully.

To complicate things further, a few days later, her dad called her and said he didn’t want to see me again unless I could behave like an adult. This made things even more awkward between us. My girlfriend wants to fix things with her dad but feels torn because I stood up for myself. I think both of us could have handled the situation better.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I need to share something that happened recently at my workplace. I work at a small cafe where we pride ourselves on being a welcoming and inclusive space. Last week, we had a regular customer, Sarah, who is a good friend of mine. She’s always upbeat and positive, which makes her popular among the staff and patrons. 

On that day, a new customer came in who was visibly upset and quite rude to my co-workers. As I was taking Sarah's order, I overheard the new customer complaining loudly about the wait times and how ""nobody here knows how to run a cafe."" It was a bit awkward, and I could see my co-workers were trying their best to manage the rush.

After I served Sarah, I decided to approach the new customer to see if I could help. I said, ""I understand the wait can be frustrating. We’re trying our best back there."" The customer shot back, ""Maybe if everyone wasn't so busy chatting with their friends, we wouldn't have this problem."" 

At this point, I felt a little defensive because I knew my co-workers were working hard. So, I replied, ""We're not just a factory, we’re a community here. We enjoy our customers and each other."" My tone was a bit sharper than I intended, but I was frustrated with how rude he was being.

The customer then started yelling, calling me unprofessional and saying that I should be fired. I felt embarrassed, and Sarah, who was still nearby, tried to defuse the situation by saying something light-hearted, but it didn’t help. Eventually, the manager had to step in and ask the customer to calm down and leave.

After the incident, I felt bad for how I spoke to the customer, but I also felt justified in defending my team. Sarah later told me that I shouldn’t have engaged with the customer at all and that it made things worse. I went home feeling conflicted; I don’t like being rude, but I also don’t like when people disrespect my workplace.

So, my friend group has been pretty tight for years, but things have gotten tense lately. I'm 28f, and my friend, Jake, is 29. We’ve shared a lot of good times together, but he can be quite insensitive. 

A couple of months ago, I lost my dad to an illness. It hit me hard, and while my friends supported me, Jake kept making jokes about it, saying he was just trying to lighten the mood. I told him multiple times that it wasn't funny and that he needed to stop, but he kept at it.

Recently, I organized a small memorial gathering for my dad, just some close friends and family. I made it clear it was a solemn occasion and that I didn’t want any jokes or inappropriate behavior. Jake RSVP’d but then showed up wearing a t-shirt with a funny slogan that I knew he thought was hilarious. When I asked him to change, he laughed it off and said it was just a shirt.

During the gathering, he kept making light-hearted comments and trying to make people laugh. I finally snapped and told him to leave, which caused a huge scene. He was visibly upset and said I was overreacting and trying to ruin his fun. Afterward, our mutual friends were split—some thought I was justified, while others said I handled it poorly. I feel bad for kicking him out but also felt I had to stand up for myself.

Everyone sucks here,"So I (19, male) have a younger brother (16) who’s really into gaming. He’s always on his console and I get it; it’s his way of unwinding after school. But he’s also really competitive and can get pretty heated when he plays. 

A while back, he was playing this new game and bragged about how he was the best in our friend group. I thought it would be fun to challenge him, so I jumped into a match with him. At first, it was all good and we were having a blast. But then I started winning, and he got really upset about it. He accused me of ""cheating"" and being a ""try-hard,"" which I thought was ridiculous. I mean, it's just a game, right? 

After a few rounds, I couldn’t help but poke a little fun at him. I said things like, “Looks like the best in the group is getting schooled” and “Maybe you should practice more.” I thought it was lighthearted teasing, but he got really defensive and started yelling at me, saying I was a jerk for rubbing it in his face.

Things escalated when I pointed out that he always does the same to his friends when he wins, but he didn’t see how that was hypocritical. He threw his controller down and stormed out of the room, and I felt kind of bad, but I was also frustrated that he couldn’t take a joke. 

A couple of days later, he ended up losing a tournament he was super hyped about, and I couldn’t resist bringing it up in our usual banter. I told him, “Guess you’re not the best anymore, huh?” He got really quiet and just shot me a glare, but I figured he was overreacting again.

Now, I’m not sure if I went too far. I was just trying to have fun like we always do, but I also feel bad for how he reacted.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I (28M) have a friend, Jake (30M), who I've known for years. We used to be really close, but over time, we've drifted apart. Recently, he reached out to me, wanting to reconnect and hang out. I was excited at first but then remembered that he has a habit of being very self-centered. During our last few hangouts, he dominated the conversation, only talking about his life and problems without asking about mine. It left me feeling pretty unappreciated, but I didn't want to hurt his feelings, so I kept my mouth shut.

We decided to meet up again last weekend. I was really looking forward to it, but as soon as we met, he started telling me about all the issues he was dealing with at work and in his personal life, and it felt like it was the same old story. I tried to steer the conversation to my life and what I’ve been up to, but he just kept interrupting me. At one point, I snapped and said, “Can we talk about something that isn’t just about you for once?” 

He looked taken aback and then got defensive, saying that he thought I was there to support him and listen to his problems. The whole mood shifted, and we ended up arguing. I left feeling guilty, but also frustrated because I feel like I've been trying to be a good friend while he doesn't reciprocate at all. 

Now, I’m left wondering if I overreacted and if maybe I should have just tried to be more patient and understanding.

Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I have been together for about five years, and we recently moved in together. Things were going well until we started to discuss our finances and how to manage expenses. I’ve always been a bit more frugal and careful with money, while my partner tends to be more of a spender. This difference in our financial habits started to cause some tension.

One day, I noticed that my partner had ordered takeout for the third time that week. I brought it up casually, suggesting that we could save money by cooking at home more often. My partner got defensive, saying that they work hard and deserve to treat themselves once in a while. I understood that, but I felt frustrated because I was trying to save for a vacation we had talked about.

Things escalated when I accidentally found a receipt for a fancy dinner they had with friends that I wasn’t invited to. I snapped and confronted my partner, bringing up the dinner and how irresponsible it felt when we had agreed to be more mindful about spending together. My partner retaliated by pointing out how I always seem to focus on money and never want to enjoy life.

In the heat of the moment, I told them they were being selfish and immature for not considering our future together. My partner yelled back that I was being controlling and that they wouldn’t let me dictate how they spend their money. It turned into a huge argument, and we both said things we didn’t mean. I ended up storming off to my friend’s place for the night.

A few days later, we both calmed down and had a more rational conversation, but the damage was done. A couple of my friends think I overreacted and should have approached the topic more gently, while others think my partner should have been more considerate of our financial goals.

Everyone sucks here,"My sister and I have always had a rocky relationship, but it got worse over the last couple of years. She went through a tough breakup and really leaned on me for support. I tried my best to be there for her, but it felt like I was constantly her emotional punching bag. 

After a while, I started feeling really drained. I mentioned to her that I needed a little space to focus on my own mental health, and she reacted poorly. Instead of understanding, she accused me of abandoning her when she needed me the most. We ended up having a huge fight over it, and I told her that I couldn't just be her therapist.

Fast forward a couple of months, and she suddenly had a new boyfriend who seemed to sweep her off her feet. I was happy for her, but I also felt a bit resentful because it seemed like she forgot all about our previous conversations. When she called me excitedly to introduce him a few weeks later, I made a sarcastic comment about how “nice it must be to have someone else to rely on.” She got really upset, saying I was being bitter and selfish.

Things came to a head during our family gathering for our mom's birthday. My sister brought her new boyfriend along, and I felt a surge of jealousy. I ended up making a passive-aggressive joke about how he must have a lot of patience to deal with her. The tension in the room was palpable, and our mom had to intervene.

There were a lot of people I didn't know, but I was having a good time catching up with friends. At one point, I noticed that my drink had gone empty, so I decided to grab another from the cooler.

While I was filling my cup, I overheard a couple of guys talking about how they were going to prank one of the birthday gifts. I thought it would be funny to join in, so I asked what they had in mind. They mentioned something about hiding the gift and putting a sign that said “Finders Keepers” on it. I thought it would be hilarious to contribute, so I suggested we actually take the gift and hide it somewhere really silly, like in the bathroom.

We went ahead with the plan, and when the birthday guy noticed his gift was missing, he started to panic a little. At first, everyone thought it was funny, but then it got a bit out of hand as he became genuinely upset. I realized it was crossing a line, but instead of backing out, I just laughed it off, thinking it would blow over.

Eventually, we found the gift and brought it back, but the birthday guy was still pretty hurt. Some friends told me I was out of line for participating in the prank, while others thought it was just harmless fun. I felt bad for him, but I also thought everyone needed to lighten up a bit.

Everyone was drinking, and I was having a good time until I noticed my friend, Sarah, sitting alone in a corner looking upset. I approached her and asked what was wrong. She explained that she was feeling overwhelmed and didn’t want to be around all the noise. I suggested we step outside for some fresh air.

Once outside, we started talking, and I realized she was really struggling with some personal issues. While we were discussing this, I noticed a few other friends looking for us. They eventually found us and interrupted our conversation. One of them, Mike, jokingly said, ""What are you two doing out here? Having a secret meeting?"" He laughed, and the others joined in. Sarah looked even more uncomfortable, and I felt a bit defensive.

In the heat of the moment, I snapped at Mike, saying something like, ""Maybe you should try being a good friend instead of making jokes!"" It was harsh, and I immediately regretted it. The mood shifted, and Mike looked taken aback. The other friends were silent, clearly unsure how to respond.

After that, I tried to apologize to Mike, but he brushed it off, saying it was fine. However, the vibe at the party had changed, and I could feel the tension. I spent the rest of the night feeling guilty about how I reacted, especially since I didn’t mean to ruin the fun for everyone.

Looking back, I realize I shouldn’t have snapped at Mike, but I also feel like he shouldn’t have joked about Sarah's situation when it was clearly bothering her. I’m torn about whether I was in the wrong for how I reacted or if Mike's comments were inappropriate in that context.

Recently, I started a new full-time job, which has made it difficult for me to help her out as much. I explained my situation to Emma, letting her know that I could only assist on weekends occasionally. However, she became upset and said that I was abandoning her when she needed me most. She reminded me how much she had helped me when I was struggling to find work, and I felt guilty.

In my frustration, I told her that she needed to start paying me a proper wage if she wanted me to be more available. I thought it was a reasonable request, considering how much time I had already dedicated to her business without formal compensation. Emma took this as a betrayal, claiming that friends should help each other without expecting payment.

Last month, we went to a party hosted by another friend, Sarah (30F). During the party, I noticed that Emily seemed to be getting really close to Jake (27M), someone we both know but aren’t particularly close to. They were laughing, dancing, and it felt like they were the only two people in the room. I started feeling a bit left out and insecure about our friendship, thinking that maybe I was losing her to him.

In a moment of frustration, I brought it up to her the next day, saying that I felt like she was neglecting our friendship for a guy she barely knew. I was upset and probably a bit dramatic, but I just wanted her to understand how I felt. Instead of being understanding, she snapped back that I was being jealous and controlling. She said I needed to be more supportive of her happiness and that I was taking this too far.

I admit I didn’t handle the conversation well. I raised my voice and accused her of not caring about our friendship anymore. I ended up saying some hurtful things, like calling her ""fake"" for pretending to be invested in our friendship while she was off chasing after guys. Looking back, I realize I was projecting my insecurities onto her, and I regret that.

Emily, on her part, reacted defensively and told me that I should be happy for her if she wants to explore something with Jake. She claimed I was trying to control her life and that I should trust her judgment. We ended up arguing for hours and both said things that hurt each other.

One day, while browsing an adoption site, I came across a cute, middle-aged dog who had been in the shelter for a long time. I instantly fell in love with her and thought she would be a perfect fit for us. I showed the dog to my partner, but he was hesitant. He argued that adopting an older dog might come with more health issues, and he wanted to adopt a puppy instead so we could train it from the start.

I was really disappointed because I felt a connection with this older dog and wanted to give her a chance at a loving home. I started pushing for my choice, sharing stories about how older dogs can be just as loving and how adopting her could save her life. My partner eventually agreed to go meet the dog, but he still expressed doubts.

When we went to the shelter, I was over the moon to see how affectionate the dog was. I played with her and even took her for a short walk around the area.

My friend group is pretty tight-knit, and we’ve been hanging out for years. We’ve always had an unspoken rule that we share our plans before making any decisions about outings—like, if one person is planning something, we all discuss it to see who’s available.

Recently, one of my friends, Lisa, decided to plan a surprise birthday party for another friend, Mark. The catch is that she didn’t include me in any of the planning conversations. I found out about the party through another mutual friend who assumed I was in the loop, and I felt really hurt that I wasn’t asked to be part of it. I’ve helped organize several events in the past, and I thought we were all on the same page about sharing the load.

When I confronted Lisa about it, she got defensive and said she wanted to keep it a surprise and thought I might ruin it by accidentally letting it slip. I understand where she’s coming from, but I felt really excluded. I told her that I felt left out and that it hurt my feelings. Instead of apologizing, she argued that it was too late to change anything and that I should’ve just trusted her judgment.

Jake has been dating Sarah for about six months, and while I think they're great together, I’ve noticed that Jake has been pretty distant with his friends since they got together. I mentioned this to the group, jokingly saying that Jake was “whipped” and that we never see him anymore because he’s too busy being a boyfriend. I thought it would be funny, but Jake looked upset and defensive. 

Sarah quickly jumped to his defense, saying it’s normal to spend time with a partner and that I shouldn’t be so judgmental. I replied that I wasn’t judging him; I just missed hanging out with my friend. The atmosphere got a bit awkward after that, and Mike chimed in, saying that we shouldn’t put so much pressure on them to balance their time between friends and relationships. I agreed, but I still felt like Jake was neglecting us.

Things escalated when Lisa, who had been quiet until now, said that it was unfair to blame Jake for being in a relationship when every one of us had been there before. I snapped back and said that it was just a joke and that they were being overly sensitive. That only made the situation worse. Sarah called me toxic for not being supportive of their relationship, and I shot back that I was allowed to express my feelings too, especially since I considered Jake a close friend.

By this point, the mood was pretty tense. Jake looked really uncomfortable, and Sarah was visibly upset.

Everyone sucks here,"I (27F) have a close group of friends that I’ve known since high school, and we often hang out together. Lately, we’ve been planning a big trip for the summer, and everyone is really excited about it. However, I've noticed that one of my friends, Sarah (26F), has been feeling left out of the planning. She’s been going through some personal issues and hasn’t been as involved as the rest of us.

One night, while we were all hanging out, I made a comment about how we should pick a destination that has a lot of fun activities. I jokingly said, “If we pick somewhere boring, we might as well just take Sarah along to stare at the wall.” Everyone laughed, but I could see Sarah’s face drop. I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings; I thought we were just joking around.

Later that night, Sarah confronted me about my comment. She said that I always joke about her being boring and that it really bothers her, especially since she’s going through a tough time. I was taken aback and tried to explain that I didn’t mean anything by it, but I could tell she was upset. I ended up getting defensive and said that if she didn’t want to be joked about, maybe she should try being more fun and engaging.

Things escalated, and soon we were both arguing. The other friends tried to mediate, but it turned into a group argument where everyone started bringing up past grievances. I realized that I was partly at fault for not considering her feelings, but I also felt like she overreacted and was being sensitive. 

In the end, it turned into a massive blowup, and we all ended up leaving upset. Now there’s tension in the group, and I can’t help but feel like we all contributed to the situation spiraling out of control. So, AITA for my comments and the way I handled the situation?",823,775,0.58,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_38347,2018-07-26 00:00:00,ESH,1771,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, this happened a few weeks ago at a family gathering, and I’m using a throwaway for privacy.

My brother recently got engaged, and our family was throwing an engagement party for him and his fiancée. I was really happy for them, but I have to admit I’ve been feeling a bit overlooked lately because I recently lost my job, and I’ve been struggling to find a new one while trying to keep my spirits up.

During the party, everyone was showering my brother and his fiancée with compliments, and I couldn’t help but feel a little bitter about my own situation. At one point, in a moment of weakness, I made a sarcastic comment during the toast, something along the lines of “Well, at least one of us is getting something good in life.” It got an awkward laugh, but it put a damper on the mood.

After that, my brother’s fiancée pulled me aside and told me that my comment was really inappropriate and that I needed to be more supportive. I snapped back, saying that maybe if they hadn’t made it all about their engagement, I wouldn’t have felt so left out. That led to a heated argument where I basically told her that just because she was getting married didn’t mean I had to pretend everything was great in my life.

Now, my brother is upset with me for ruining the celebration, and I feel bad, but I also think they were being a bit insensitive to my situation. So, AITA for making that comment and then getting defensive when called out?",642,2247,0.72,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_48611,2018-12-01 00:00:00,ESH,1441,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I recently started a new job at a small tech company, and I quickly became friends with a colleague named Jake. He’s a nice guy, but he has a tendency to complain about everything, from the coffee in the break room to how the office is managed. I typically try to stay positive and encourage him to see the brighter side of things.

However, last week, Jake was particularly upset about a team meeting where our manager shared some feedback about our projects. He thought the critique was unfair and started venting to me about how he felt unappreciated and overlooked. I listened for a bit, but then I couldn’t help but point out that his attitude might be contributing to how others perceive him. I suggested that maybe he should try to be more open to feedback instead of just complaining.

He didn't take it well and accused me of being condescending and not understanding his struggles. I got defensive and told him that being negative all the time was exhausting, and he needed to get over himself. We ended up having a pretty heated argument, and I walked away feeling frustrated.

Later that day, I overheard him telling a couple of other colleagues about our argument, painting me as the bad guy who couldn't empathize with his situation. I felt betrayed and told a few people about our disagreement, emphasizing that I was just trying to help him see things differently.

Now, the atmosphere in our team feels tense, and Jake and I are avoiding each other. I know I shouldn’t have engaged in gossip about him, but I also think he should have taken my advice more constructively. 

So, am I the asshole for calling him out on his negativity and then reacting poorly when he started sharing our argument with others?",729,1895,0.78,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_34455,2024-10-14 00:00:00,ESH,1724,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So a few weeks ago, I had a family gathering for my cousin's birthday. It was a big event, with lots of relatives I hadn't seen in a while. I was excited to catch up with everyone, but I was also a bit anxious because I knew my aunt, who is known for her bluntness, would be there.

During the party, we were all sitting around the table, sharing stories and enjoying the food. At one point, my aunt asked me about my job. I’ve been working as a freelance graphic designer for a couple of years now, and while I’m doing well, I sometimes feel insecure about it compared to my peers who have stable corporate jobs.

When I mentioned my work, my aunt laughed and said, “Oh, that’s cute. But when are you going to get a real job?” I felt my face flush with embarrassment, and I tried to laugh it off, but inside, I was fuming. I didn’t want to make a scene, so I just said, “I am happy with what I do,” hoping she would drop it.

But then, she went on to compare my work to my cousin’s corporate job, saying things like, “At least he has job security. You should really consider something more stable.” I snapped. I felt like my passion and hard work were being belittled, so I retorted, “At least I’m doing something I love instead of being stuck in a boring cubicle!”

The table went silent. My cousin looked uncomfortable, and my aunt seemed taken aback. My mom tried to diffuse the situation by changing the topic, but I could tell my aunt was annoyed. Later on, she pulled me aside and said I was being too sensitive and that I should just accept her advice since she meant well.

I felt guilty for snapping at her, but at the same time, I felt justified because she was being rude and dismissive about something that means a lot to me. In the end, the gathering was a bit tense, and I regretted how I handled things but also felt my feelings were valid.

AITA for snapping at my aunt when she made fun of my job? I know I overreacted a bit, but it really hurt to hear her talk down about my career. I feel like we both could have handled this better.",666,2833,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_74012,2024-05-01 00:00:00,ESH,2053,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I am 23, and recently had a falling out with my roommate, who is also my close friend. 

We’ve been living together for a year and generally get along well, but lately, I’ve been feeling overwhelmed. I work a demanding job, and I also have a side gig that takes up a lot of my time. My roommate, on the other hand, has a much more flexible schedule and has been spending more time at home, which has led to some tension. 

A few weeks ago, we planned a small gathering with some friends for the weekend. I told my roommate I’d handle the grocery shopping and get everything we needed. I went to the store and ended up spending around $100. When I got back, I realized my roommate had invited additional people without discussing it with me first. I felt frustrated because I didn’t budget for extra guests, and I didn’t think it was fair to spring that on me last minute. 

During the party, I tried to enjoy myself, but I was annoyed about the money situation. I ended up snapping at my roommate and saying something like, “Next time, maybe you should consult me before inviting a bunch of people over.” It was rude, and I shouldn't have said it in front of our friends. 

The next day, my roommate confronted me about my behavior. We argued, and I told them they should have considered my feelings before inviting extra people. They retorted that I should have just brought it up earlier instead of holding it in and exploding. 

Now we’re both upset, and it’s created a rift in our friendship. I feel guilty for how I reacted, but I also think my roommate was inconsiderate.

Everyone sucks here,"Hi, I need some perspective on a situation that’s been bothering me. 

So I recently started a new job, and it’s been a bit overwhelming. I’m trying to learn the ropes and fit in with my team, but everyone seems to already have their own established dynamics. I really like my coworkers, but I feel like I’m struggling to keep up, especially with my boss, who has a very direct management style.

Last week, during a team meeting, my boss called on me to present my progress on a project I was working on. I was nervous and stumbled through my presentation, and I could tell my boss was frustrated. After the meeting, he pulled me aside to give me feedback, which I appreciated, but I was still feeling a bit defeated.

That evening, I vented to a friend about how stressful the job is and mentioned how my boss can be really harsh. I didn’t mean to, but I kind of implied that he’s just a difficult person to work for. The next day, my friend posted about it on social media, tagging my boss in the post. It wasn’t malicious, but it wasn’t exactly flattering, either.

Well, my boss found out about the post and was understandably upset. He called me into his office and expressed how unprofessional it was for me to badmouth him, even if it was just to a friend. I felt terrible and apologized, but I also felt like he overreacted a bit. 

Now, I’ve been trying to keep my head down at work, but I feel like the entire situation put a strain on my relationship with my boss and my coworkers. I didn’t mean for any of this to happen, but I also felt like my feelings were valid.

Everyone sucks here,"I have a friend, Jake, who I've known for over ten years. We're really close and have always supported each other through various life changes. Recently, Jake got a promotion at work, and while I was genuinely happy for him, I also felt a little envious because I've been stuck in the same position for a while.

To celebrate his promotion, Jake invited me and a few other friends out for drinks. I wanted to support him, but I also felt like I needed to vent about my frustrations with my job. During the evening, I brought up how I felt undervalued at work and how I was struggling with my own career path. I was hoping to get some advice from him, thinking that maybe his new position could give me some insight.

As the night went on, I noticed that Jake seemed less excited about his promotion and more focused on my problems. I didn’t mean for it to turn into a therapy session, but I kept sharing more about my dissatisfaction, hoping to hear from him. At one point, Jake interrupted me and said, “Can we focus on the positive for a bit? This was supposed to be my celebration.” I felt a little hurt but brushed it off, thinking he just needed to blow off steam. 

In the following days, I sent him a text to check in, and he replied, ""Honestly, I felt like my promotion got overshadowed, and it bummed me out. I was really hoping to celebrate."" I didn’t mean to take away from his moment, but I figured he could also help me with my issues since he's in a better place now. I told him that I didn’t realize I was being selfish and that I was sorry, but I also felt like he didn’t have to take it so personally.

Our conversation spiraled into a back-and-forth where we both ended up feeling hurt. I told him he was being too sensitive, and he called me self-absorbed. We ended up agreeing to take a break from each other to cool down.

Everyone sucks here,"I was at a coffee shop last weekend, trying to enjoy my latte and catch up on some work. The place was pretty busy, and I was sitting at a small table near the entrance. 

While I was typing away, a couple came in and took the table next to mine. They were clearly on a date, and a few minutes later, I noticed they were engaging in a rather loud conversation. I could hear every detail of their discussion, from their plans for the weekend to some personal stories that felt a bit too intimate for a public space.

After a while, it started to get distracting, and I found myself unable to focus on my work. I tried to ignore them, but eventually, I got frustrated. I leaned over and said, ""Hey, could you keep it down a bit? I’m trying to work here."" 

They both looked shocked and the woman said, ""Sorry, but we’re just having a conversation."" I replied, ""I understand, but it’s really loud and I can’t concentrate."" The guy rolled his eyes and muttered something under his breath, while the woman just shrugged and they continued talking at the same volume.

Feeling annoyed, I decided to put my headphones on, which helped a little, but I still felt like I had to say something. I looked over again and said, ""Seriously, I asked nicely. It’s really hard to work with all this noise."" 

This time they both looked at me with disdain, and the guy said, ""Maybe you should have chosen a quieter place to work."" I shot back, ""Maybe you should be more considerate of others."" 

By this point, I had escalated the situation unnecessarily, and they continued their conversation while casting annoyed glances my way.

At first, I tried to ignore it, but he kept targeting me, making jokes about my choices in the game and calling me out whenever I made a mistake.

After a while, I snapped and started giving it right back to him. I made fun of his terrible dice rolls and joked about how the game was clearly rigged because he was cheating. The atmosphere became tense, and some of the other guests seemed uncomfortable. Mark got really defensive, and it turned into a back-and-forth that neither of us could back down from.

In a moment of frustration, I threw my drink at him, hitting him squarely in the chest. It was a pretty childish move, and I regretted it almost immediately, but I was just so fed up with his attitude. He retaliated by shoving the game board off the table, causing pieces to scatter everywhere. His girlfriend, who was trying to mediate, ended up getting splashed with some of my drink, and she looked furious.

One night, I came home to find the kitchen a mess. Dishes were piled high in the sink, food was left out on the counter, and there were crumbs all over the floor. I had asked Sam multiple times to help keep the place clean, but nothing seemed to change. So, I snapped and confronted Sam about it, saying something like, “You can’t just treat this place like a pigsty and expect me to clean up after you.”

Sam got defensive and started shouting back, saying that I was overreacting and that it was just a little mess. I responded by pointing out that it wasn’t just a little mess; it was a constant problem, and that they never seem to care about how their habits affect me. In the heat of the moment, I also mentioned that it’s not fair for me to do all the cleaning while they sit back and act like it’s no big deal.

Things escalated, and we both ended up saying hurtful things. Sam accused me of being uptight and controlling, while I told Sam they were lazy and inconsiderate. After a few minutes of shouting, we both just stormed off to our respective rooms.

The next day, I felt guilty about how we handled the situation. I know I shouldn’t have lost my temper like that, but at the same time, I believe my frustration was justified given the ongoing issues we’ve had with cleanliness.

We’ve become pretty friendly over that time, often grabbing lunch together and chatting about our personal lives. Recently, I confided in her about my struggles with anxiety and how it sometimes makes it hard for me to perform at work. I trusted her with this information because I felt like she would understand, as she had mentioned having her own mental health struggles in the past.

Fast forward a few weeks, and I was feeling particularly stressed about an upcoming project deadline. I vented to Emily during our lunch break, expressing my concerns and how my anxiety was really getting the best of me.

She was sharing my personal struggles without my consent, seemingly to get sympathy or attention for herself. I felt completely betrayed and humiliated.

In the heat of the moment, I confronted her about it. Instead of apologizing, she got defensive and accused me of being too sensitive. She claimed that I should be more open about my struggles and that talking about them with others could help destigmatize mental health issues. While I agree with that sentiment, I never wanted my struggles to be shared without my permission.

Feeling hurt and angry, I decided to share some of her personal struggles — specifically her issues with time management and a few mistakes she had made at work — with a couple of other coworkers. I thought if she was going to air my dirty laundry, then I could do the same. Now, this has created a rift in our workplace, and other colleagues are caught in the middle.

After a few drinks, I decided to take action. I pulled her boyfriend aside and told him that he should spend more time with her, especially on a special occasion like this. I may have come off a bit harsh because I was feeling protective. I told him he was being really inconsiderate and that he needed to step it up. He seemed taken aback and walked away.

Later that night, my friend confronted me. She was upset and said I embarrassed her boyfriend in front of everyone. I tried to explain that I was just looking out for her and that I thought she deserved better. But she said I overstepped and that it wasn’t my place to say anything to him.

I’ve tried to be supportive, but I’ve noticed that her drinking has escalated to the point where she’s become pretty reckless. 

Last month, she had a party at her place, and she invited me along. I thought it would be a great chance to hang out, but as the night went on, it became clear that she was not in a good state.

I thought it would help her see that she was spiraling, but instead, she got really upset and accused me of being judgmental. She said I was being a bad friend for not supporting her way of coping. 

Feeling guilty, I tried to apologize, but the damage was done. Our mutual friends were caught in the middle and tensions rose. I ended up venting to a couple of friends about Sarah’s behavior, saying I was worried about her, but I also made some snarky comments about her drinking that I regret.

I understood but still wanted to have a good time, so I invited a couple of other friends over instead.

Now, here’s where things got messy. During the game night, I made a few jokes about relationships and dating while we were playing, and somebody mentioned Mia’s breakup. I didn’t think much of it and made a comment about how she should just focus on herself and maybe try online dating or something. It was meant to be light-hearted, but I could tell it didn’t sit well with a couple of my friends.

The next day, Mia found out we had the game night and was really upset that we didn’t include her, especially since she had been feeling down. She confronted me, saying that I didn’t care about her feelings and that I should’ve canceled the game night to support her instead. I felt bad for her but honestly, I needed some fun too after a long week.

I told her that I understood she was hurting, but I also had my needs and wanted to enjoy myself. I felt like I was being put in a position where I had to choose between my friend’s feelings and my own happiness. We ended up arguing, and I suggested that maybe she was being a bit dramatic about it. 

Now, I feel conflicted because I did want to support her, but I also don’t think I should cancel my plans for her. AITA for having the game night and for the way I handled the situation?",24,2404,0.9,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_95250,2023-05-13 00:00:00,ESH,1988,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I've always been passionate about music and have been playing guitar for over a decade. Recently, I started teaching guitar lessons on the side to earn some extra money. I’ve had a few students, including my niece, who’s about 14. I genuinely enjoy teaching and love sharing my knowledge with others.

However, my sister has been very critical of my teaching style. She believes I should be more structured and focused on theory, while I prefer a more relaxed approach, encouraging creativity and self-expression. We’ve had several arguments about this, and I feel like she doesn’t trust my ability to teach her daughter.

Last week, my niece came to me excited about a song she wanted to learn. I suggested we work on it together, and we spent the lesson playing and experimenting with different styles. When my sister found out, she flipped out, saying I was wasting her daughter’s time and that she wasn't learning anything valuable.

In a moment of frustration, I told my sister that if she wanted her daughter to learn guitar in her way, she should find someone else to teach her. This led to a big fight where she called me irresponsible and I called her controlling. Both of us ended up saying hurtful things.

Now, I feel bad for how I responded, but I also think my sister overreacted. We both have our own views on teaching and learning, but maybe I could have handled it better.

So, my boyfriend and I have been together for about a year. We are both in our mid-20s, and he is really passionate about fitness and nutrition. I, on the other hand, have a more relaxed approach to food and exercise. I enjoy cooking and baking, and I don't mind indulging in treats every now and then.

Last week, I made a batch of cookies for us to enjoy while we watched a movie. They were chocolate chip, and I used a family recipe that I love. When my boyfriend saw the cookies, he got really upset and started lecturing me about how sugar is terrible for you and how I should be more mindful of our health. I tried to explain that it's okay to enjoy treats in moderation, but he wouldn’t let it go. 

Things escalated when he outright refused to eat any of them. I was hurt because I put effort into making something nice for us to share. I snapped and told him that he was being controlling and that he was ruining our time together by being so uptight about food. He shot back that I was being irresponsible and that our health should come first. 

We ended up having a huge argument, and I stormed off to the bedroom while he sulked on the couch. We both said some pretty hurtful things, and I know I shouldn't have dismissed his concerns about health, but it felt like he was trying to dictate what I could and couldn't enjoy. 

The next day, we talked it out and apologized, but the tension lingered. I definitely could have handled my reaction better, and he probably shouldn't have been so intense about the cookies. AITA?",48,1581,0.79,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_90215,2019-07-14 00:00:00,ESH,1587,AITA

Recently, I've noticed that whenever we have discussions about our plans or things we want to do, she tends to shut down or get defensive if I suggest any changes or express a different opinion.

The other day, we were planning a weekend trip, and I mentioned that I thought it might be fun to go hiking instead of just lounging by the beach, which is something we've done many times. She immediately got upset and said she wanted to relax and didn’t want to do anything physically demanding. I tried to explain that hiking could still be relaxing and that I thought it would be a nice change of pace.

Instead of hearing me out, she started saying that I was always trying to change our plans and that I never listen to what she wants to do. I felt frustrated and said that I was just trying to suggest something new, and that it wasn’t fair to label me like that. We ended up in a pretty heated argument, with both of us raising our voices.

Later, I felt bad about how things escalated, but I also think she could have been more open to my ideas instead of getting defensive right away. By the end of the day, we both apologized, but I still feel like we both handled the situation poorly. It’s hard to navigate our disagreements when we both get emotional so quickly.

We grew up together, and I remember him constantly being the ""health nut"" in the family. I, on the other hand, enjoy cooking and trying new recipes, which often include richer ingredients. 

Recently, I hosted a family gathering at my house, and I made a big dinner spread, complete with appetizers, a hearty main course, and desserts. I put a lot of effort into it because I wanted everyone to enjoy themselves. During the dinner, Jake was very vocal about how unhealthy the food was. He made comments like, ""You know, this much pasta isn't good for you,"" and ""Why would you put so much cheese in that?"" I brushed it off, thinking he was just being his usual self.

Later, when everyone was having dessert, I noticed Jake barely touched his plate. When I jokingly asked him if he was on a diet or something, he snapped back that he just couldn't eat that kind of food because it was too unhealthy. I thought he was being a bit dramatic, and I told him that it was just a meal and that he should lighten up. He said, ""Not everyone can afford to eat like this and not have it affect them.""

Feeling defensive, I shot back that it wasn't my fault if he couldn't handle a little indulgence. My family noticed the tension, and things got really awkward. Afterward, I felt bad because I didn't mean to escalate it, but I also felt hurt by his comments about my cooking.

I really enjoy it, but I have been noticing that one of my coworkers, Sarah, tends to dominate the conversation. She has a lot of great ideas, but she often interrupts others and talks over them, which can be frustrating.

Last week, during our lunch, I brought up an issue I was facing with a project. As I was explaining it, Sarah jumped in with her own experiences and completely derailed the conversation. I was annoyed but tried to stay patient. After a few minutes of her talking, I snapped and said, “Can you just let me finish for once?” I immediately regretted it because I could see everyone go silent, and Sarah looked hurt.

After lunch, I apologized to Sarah, but she brushed it off and said she was used to people reacting like that when she talked a lot. I wanted to explain that it wasn’t just about her talking too much but how she often interrupts, but I didn’t want to escalate things further.

A couple of days later, during a team meeting, she pulled me aside and confronted me about my outburst. I got defensive, and we ended up arguing a bit before the meeting started. Other team members noticed and it made things awkward for everyone.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I found myself in a pretty sticky situation recently with my group of friends, and I’m really torn about whether we all messed up or if it was just me. 

A few months ago, we were planning a camping trip for our friend group, which consists of about six of us. We’ve been friends for years, but there’s this one guy, Jake, who’s always been a bit of a buzzkill. He’s super negative, constantly complains, and often brings down the mood whenever we hang out. We’ve tried to include him in everything, but he just keeps draining the energy out of the group, and it’s exhausting.

As we were planning the trip, I was really excited and wanted it to be a fun experience for everyone. I suggested that maybe we should leave Jake out of this one because I felt like he would ruin the vibe. I didn’t think anyone would actually go for it, but surprisingly everyone else agreed. We all felt like we could really enjoy ourselves without his constant negativity hanging around.

When we finally told Jake that we were going camping but that we decided to keep the trip small this time, he was understandably upset. He asked why he wasn’t invited, and we all kind of shrugged it off, pretending it was just a matter of logistics. I felt bad seeing him hurt, but at the same time, I convinced myself it was for the best.

The trip went great for us, and we had a fantastic time without Jake. But afterward, I started feeling guilty. I knew we could’ve included him and maybe even tried to help him see things more positively. He’s not a bad person; he just struggles with his outlook on life. I keep wondering if we were just being petty and excluding him instead of being mature about it. 

Now I'm stuck between feeling like it was justified since we wanted to enjoy ourselves, but also feeling like we really hurt a friend who might have just needed a different environment to open up. I can’t help but think that maybe we all acted like jerks in this situation. So, AITA for suggesting we leave Jake out, or are we all just a little bit at fault here?",445,699,0.63,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_92093,2020-05-13 00:00:00,ESH,2047,AITA

Sarah has always been more of a spontaneous person, while I tend to be more reserved and responsible, especially when it comes to financial decisions. 

Last month, Sarah invited me to a weekend getaway with a group of friends. I was excited but also concerned because I knew that she often spends money carelessly. We agreed to split the costs for the rental house, food, and activities. I suggested we create a budget to keep things under control, but Sarah brushed it off, saying we should just have fun and not worry about the money.

As the trip drew closer, I noticed Sarah was making plans for expensive activities, like booking a private boat for a day, which was way beyond what we had initially discussed. I voiced my concerns, but she dismissed them, saying we could just ""figure it out later."" I felt frustrated because I didn’t want to end up covering costs that were way above my budget.

On the first night of the trip, after a long day of expensive activities, Sarah suggested we go out for dinner at a fancy restaurant. I hesitated but agreed, thinking we could at least share some plates. When the bill came, I was shocked at how much it was, and I ended up paying more than I had anticipated. I was annoyed that Sarah hadn’t considered our budget and had pushed us into this situation.

The next day, I confronted her about it. I may have been a bit harsh, suggesting that her lack of planning was irresponsible and would end up ruining the trip for the rest of us. Sarah got defensive and accused me of being a killjoy and ruining the fun. I snapped back that I wasn’t trying to be a buzzkill, but someone had to be realistic about our finances.

Things escalated, and we both ended up saying hurtful things. I know I should have handled it better, but I was so frustrated with her attitude towards money. I felt like the responsible one, while she was acting like a child. By the end of the trip, the atmosphere was tense, and I regretted how I handled the situation.

Now, I’m reflecting on it and wondering if I was too harsh on her. Should I have just let it slide and enjoyed the trip, or was I justified in calling her out?

As the night went on, my cousin’s fiancé started making some off-color jokes that I found a bit cringeworthy. At first, I brushed it off, but as he continued making inappropriate comments about relationships and women, I felt compelled to speak up. I didn’t want anyone to feel uncomfortable or disrespected, so I called him out in a lighthearted way, saying something like, “Dude, maybe tone it down a notch? Not everyone finds that funny.” 

He didn’t take it well and snapped back, saying I was being overly sensitive and that it was just a joke. The mood shifted a bit, and I could feel tension in the air. My cousin looked embarrassed, but she didn’t say anything. Instantly, other family members started taking sides. Some agreed with me, while others sided with him, saying I was ruining the fun.

This led to a full-blown argument between him, my cousin, and me, with family members stepping in to mediate.

Everyone sucks here,"I need to vent about a situation that's been escalating between my friends and me, and I honestly don’t know if I’m in the wrong here or if it’s just a mess of miscommunication.

So here's what happened:

- A few months ago, my friend Jake decided to throw a surprise birthday party for our mutual friend Lily. He asked everyone to contribute to the planning, and I immediately jumped in to help. I offered to handle the decorations because I love doing that kind of thing.
- Jake and I had a few planning sessions, and everything seemed to be going smoothly. I thought we were on the same page, especially since we both agreed on a budget.
- As the party date approached, I started going all out with the decorations, using up my own supplies and spending some of my personal money on extras to make it really special. I was excited about it!
- A week before the party, Jake casually mentioned that he had decided to invite a bunch of people I didn’t know about, which changed the dynamic completely. I felt a bit blindsided, but I didn’t say anything because I thought it would be fun to meet new people.
- The day of the party came, and it ended up being a bigger event than I anticipated. I put in a ton of effort with the decorations, but when I got to the venue, I found out that Jake had invited more people than we originally agreed upon. This meant the decorations I worked hard on weren’t really fitting for the larger crowd. I felt frustrated.
- Midway through the party, I overheard Jake telling other guests that I was ""responsible for all the decorations"" and implying that I was the one who decided everything about the party's aesthetic. It felt like he was taking credit for my hard work without acknowledging my contributions. I ended up confronting him about it privately, and it turned into a heated argument. I told him that I felt undermined and that he should've communicated better about the guest list and his expectations.
- In the heat of the moment, I said some things I probably shouldn’t have, accusing him of being inconsiderate and not valuing my efforts. Jake got defensive and said I was overreacting, which only made me more upset.
- Since then, our friend group has felt the tension. Some people are on Jake’s side, saying I shouldn’t have reacted so strongly, while others agree that communication was lacking.

So, was I the asshole for getting upset and confronting Jake about what happened? I feel like I was trying to stand up for myself, but I also regret how I handled the situation. Now I’m stuck wondering if I could have approached it differently.

Everyone sucks here,"I’ll try to keep this brief. I (28M) have been dating my girlfriend (27F) for about six months now. She has a younger sister, Emma (16F), who lives with her and relies on her quite a bit. When I first started dating my girlfriend, Emma seemed to like me, and I tried my best to include her in our plans, like movie nights and outings.

However, a few weeks ago, things took a turn. Emma began to act out a lot more around me. She would ignore my suggestions, talk back, and even made some snide comments about me whenever my girlfriend wasn’t around. One day, I was trying to plan a family game night, and Emma flat-out refused to participate, calling it “lame” and “boring.” I felt frustrated and called her out, saying that it would be nice if she could at least try to have a good time with us. She just rolled her eyes and walked away.

When I told my girlfriend about the incident, she said I was being too hard on Emma and that I should just back off and let her be a teenager. I felt dismissed, so I started distancing myself from Emma. I stopped including her in our plans and even stopped trying to engage with her because I felt that if she didn’t want to be part of our relationship, then it wasn’t my obligation to make an effort anymore.

This has caused tension between my girlfriend and me. She feels that I’m being unfair to her sister, and I feel like if she doesn’t want to set any boundaries with Emma, then I shouldn’t have to deal with the fallout. We’ve had multiple arguments over this, and I know I’m not handling the situation perfectly either.

Everyone sucks here,"I’m really hoping for some honest feedback on this situation because it’s been bothering me and I think we both messed up. 

So, I live with my partner and we’ve been together for a couple of years. We usually have a pretty good relationship, but lately, we’ve been arguing more than usual. The other day, we were having a discussion about finances. My partner has a habit of spending money impulsively, and I’ve been trying to save for a vacation that we both talked about wanting to take. 

We were sitting in the living room, and I brought up a recent purchase they made that seemed unnecessary. I was trying to explain how it affects our ability to save for the trip, but my partner took it really personally. They started getting defensive, and instead of backing down, I continued to press the issue, thinking I was being logical. I guess I got a bit loud because I was frustrated. 

At that point, my partner got really upset and shouted that I was being controlling and that they could spend their money however they wanted. I felt hurt by that because I wasn’t trying to control anything; I just wanted us to be on the same page. In the heat of the moment, I snapped back and said something like, “You never think about the future, do you?” 

After that, things escalated. My partner stormed out of the room, and I didn’t chase after them. I sat there feeling angry and hurt, and I thought about sending a message to apologize, but I didn’t want to seem like I was backing down. 

Eventually, we both calmed down and talked it out later, but I still feel like we both crossed a line. I shouldn’t have raised my voice, but I also think my partner should’ve listened to my concerns without getting defensive.

Everyone sucks here,"I recently attended a family reunion where my parents, siblings, and a bunch of cousins were all present. It was a casual barbecue in the backyard, and everyone was mingling, catching up, and sharing stories. 

During the event, I ended up sitting next to my cousin Jake, who is a few years older than me. Jake is known for being a bit of a know-it-all and loves to discuss his latest ventures in his tech startup. I’m a creative type, working in graphic design, and while I don’t mind hearing about his business, it often feels like he’s trying to one-up everyone else.

As we chatted, he started talking about how he’s been in the process of developing this app and how it’s going to revolutionize the way people connect with their friends. He then dropped a comment about how “most people just don’t get technology” and that “if you’re not in tech, you’ll probably be left behind.”

I instantly felt defensive, as I’ve had my fair share of struggles in the industry, and I don’t appreciate being belittled. So, in a moment of frustration, I said, “Well, at least I know how to create something visually appealing instead of just lines of code.” The tension in the air shifted, and Jake looked taken aback.

He shot back with, “Yeah, but no one cares about pretty designs if it doesn’t work well. You can’t eat aesthetics.” That hit a nerve, and I replied, “Right, because everyone loves using apps that look like they were made by a five-year-old. Maybe if you focused on the user experience more than your ego, your startup wouldn’t be struggling.”

Things escalated from there, with both of us raising our voices. A few family members tried to intervene, but we were both too stubborn to back down. Eventually, we stopped talking, but the atmosphere was awkward for the rest of the reunion.

Afterward, I told my sister about the incident, and she said that we were both being immature and that I shouldn’t have taken the bait. I figured she had a point, but I wasn’t about to let Jake’s arrogance go unchecked.

In retrospect, I realize we both could have handled the conversation better and avoided the tension.",511,2197,0.75,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_53356,2018-04-14 00:00:00,ESH,2118,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"**Title: AITA for ruining my friend's birthday party?**

BACKGROUND: I (19M) have a close group of friends, and we often hang out together. Recently, one of my friends, Jake (20M), planned a big birthday party at his house, and he invited everyone from our group. I was really looking forward to it because I love parties and celebrating with friends. However, I was dealing with a lot of personal stress due to school and work, which made me a bit more on edge than usual.

On the day of the party, I arrived a bit late because I had to finish up some work. When I got there, I noticed that the atmosphere was lively, and everyone was having a great time. Jake had set up a bunch of games and activities, and it was clear a lot of effort went into making it special. I felt bad for being late and wanted to jump right in.

After chatting with some friends, I noticed that one of the games involved drinking. I’ve never been a big drinker, but that night I felt the pressure to join in and have fun. I ended up consuming more than I intended. Things escalated quickly, and I started to feel really anxious. Instead of stepping away to cool off, I let my frustration get the better of me.

At one point, during a game, I made a sarcastic comment about how lame the party was, thinking I was joking. But then, when some friends laughed, I continued to escalate, saying things like, “This is just a waste of time” and “Why are we even celebrating?” My comments made the mood awkward, and some guests started to leave, which visibly upset Jake.

Finally, after I made a particularly harsh joke about one of the games, Jake snapped and asked me to leave. I was taken aback and felt embarrassed. Instead of apologizing and leaving, I reacted defensively and yelled back at him, telling him he was overreacting and ruining his own party. I ended up storming out, feeling justified at the moment.

In hindsight, I realize that I was being an asshole by ruining the party and making it uncomfortable for everyone. Jake was just trying to celebrate his birthday, and my actions contributed to making it a negative experience. However, I also feel that Jake could have handled my comments better instead of kicking me out, which made everything worse.

Recently, she asked me to come over to help her with some things around her apartment since she’s been feeling really down. I agreed, wanting to help her out.

When I arrived, I found the place in complete disarray. There were dirty dishes piled up, trash overflowing, and the general clutter was overwhelming. I started cleaning up, but I was also frustrated because I had a lot going on in my own life, and it felt like I was doing everything for her. After a couple of hours, I snapped a little and said, “You need to take some responsibility for your own space. I can’t keep doing this for you.”

Sarah got really defensive and claimed she was trying her best but just couldn’t find the motivation to get things done. I could see she was upset, and I felt bad for how I’d reacted, but I also thought she needed to hear it. We ended up arguing, and I left feeling guilty and angry.

Later, she sent me a message saying I was being a bad friend and that she didn’t need more pressure right now. I felt hurt because I was only trying to help, but I also recognized that I could have been more understanding.

Everyone sucks here,"I wasn't sure if I should share this, but my friends convinced me to post here, saying I might be the asshole. So here’s what happened.

Last weekend, my group of friends decided to go to a concert. It was a local band we all loved, and we were really excited. I’m pretty close with one of my friends, Sarah, and we’ve been hanging out a lot lately. We’ve kind of been flirting, but we haven’t talked about it openly yet.

At the concert, we were all having a great time, dancing and enjoying the music. At one point, I noticed that Sarah had gone to get drinks. When she came back, she had a drink for me, which I thought was sweet. We were chatting, and I was feeling bold, so I leaned in to give her a kiss on the cheek as a playful gesture.

In the middle of this, one of my other friends, Jake, who’s been in a sort of “will-they-won’t-they” relationship with Sarah for a while, suddenly showed up next to us. He looked pretty upset, and when I pulled back, he told me I needed to back off because he was still trying to figure things out with her. I was taken aback; I had no idea Jake felt that way. I told him I didn’t mean to step on his toes and that I thought Sarah was interested in me too.

Things got heated, and we ended up in a bit of a shouting match right there at the concert. Sarah looked really uncomfortable and tried to intervene, but we were both so caught up in our emotions that we didn’t listen. Afterward, she left, clearly upset, and the rest of the night felt ruined.

Now I feel like I shouldn’t have kissed her and that Jake was right to be upset. But at the same time, I didn’t know he had feelings for her. My friends think I was wrong to act on my feelings without considering Jake, but I also think he shouldn’t have confronted me like that in public.

Everyone sucks here,"I recently started a new job in a small office with five other coworkers. The atmosphere was pretty laid-back, and we all got along well initially. However, I soon discovered that there was an unspoken rule about our lunch breaks and how we handle food in the office. 

One of my coworkers, Emily, is really particular about her lunch. She has a strict no-sharing policy, which she made clear to everyone after I innocently offered to share my homemade pasta with her one day. She was polite but firm, saying she prefers to keep her meals to herself. I respected that, but I noticed that she often left her dishes in the communal kitchen for hours, sometimes even overnight, which annoyed some of the other staff. 

Last week, I decided to bring in some brownies to share with everyone. I messaged the group chat letting them know there would be treats in the kitchen. To my surprise, everyone was excited except for Emily, who rolled her eyes and commented, ""Great, more food I can’t eat."" I was taken aback, but I shrugged it off. 

While cleaning up after lunch, I noticed Emily's dishes still sitting there. So, I jokingly said, ""Hey Emily, if you’re not going to eat your lunch, maybe I should just throw it away for you?"" She snapped back, saying that it was her business and that I was being rude for even suggesting that. I felt embarrassed, but I also thought she was being overly dramatic. 

After that, the atmosphere in the office shifted a bit. Emily started giving me the cold shoulder, and I found myself feeling increasingly frustrated. I confronted her about it a few days later, saying that I thought we could joke around. She accused me of not respecting her boundaries and making her feel uncomfortable, while I felt she was being too uptight about everything.

Last week, I was cooking dinner and had left my cutting board and knife on the counter after I was done. I got distracted while cleaning and forgot to put them away. My girlfriend came home, saw the mess, and immediately started complaining. I tried to explain that I was going to clean it up as soon as I was done with the dishes I was washing, but she just kept going on about how I never help out and how she feels like she’s the only one maintaining the house.

In a moment of frustration, I snapped and said, “You’re overreacting. It’s just a cutting board and a knife, not the end of the world!” That didn’t help things at all, and she got even angrier. I should have just apologized and promised to do better, but I let my annoyance get the better of me.

Everyone sucks here,"So here's the deal. I (28M) live in a small apartment complex where I share a laundry room with three other tenants. We have a system where we put our names on the sign-up sheet for laundry times, and it's been working fine—until a few weeks ago.

One of my neighbors, let's call him Dave (30M), has started to take liberties with the schedule. He frequently moves my clothes from the washer to the dryer without asking, and he even took my laundry out one time because he wanted to do his. I confronted him about it, and he shrugged it off, saying he just needed to do his laundry and that I should be more considerate of his time. I was furious, but didn't want to escalate things too much, so I let it go.

Fast forward to last week. I had a busy week and was looking forward to finally doing my laundry on a Saturday morning. I checked the sign-up sheet and saw that Dave was scheduled right before me, but he was running late. When I arrived, his clothes were still in the washer, and he wasn't around. I waited for about 20 minutes, and when he still hadn't showed up, I decided to just start my laundry and move his clothes to the dryer. I figured it would be fine since he often does that to me. 

Well, about halfway through my wash, Dave walks in and flips out on me. He yelled that it was disrespectful to touch his stuff and that he had a ""right"" to use the washer for the full time he signed up for, even if he was late. I yelled back, reminding him that he had already done the same to me. We went back and forth, but ultimately I just finished my laundry and left.

Now, I feel bad because I know I shouldn't have touched his clothes, but at the same time, he has been so inconsiderate to me.

Recently, Sarah suggested that we start a weekly check-in, where we would spend an hour every week discussing how we are feeling. While I appreciate her intention, I found it difficult to commit to this idea because I often feel drained after work and just want to relax.

I tried to express my feelings, but my partner just keeps saying he wants a puppy because he thinks it's more fun and easier to train.

Frustrated, I took to social media to vent about how my partner is being selfish and not considering the bigger picture of helping a dog in need. I posted a long rant about how he isn't thinking about the responsibility of raising a dog and how adopting a puppy is just a trend right now. In the heat of the moment, I may have exaggerated his stance and made it sound like he doesn’t care about animals at all.

He found out about the post when a mutual friend tagged him in the comments, and he was furious. He confronted me about it, saying I’d embarrassed him and that I should have discussed my feelings privately instead of airing our disagreements online. I realize now that I might have gone too far, but I still believe he’s being unreasonable about wanting a puppy.

We’ve both hurt each other with our words, and now it feels like there's a rift between us. I regret posting on social media, but I also think my partner could have been more open to discussing the idea of adopting a rescue dog. It's a messy situation, and I’m not sure if I’m in the wrong for how I expressed my feelings or if he should have been more understanding.",658,1291,0.68,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_81620,2018-06-26 00:00:00,ESH,1966,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"AITA for causing a scene at my sister’s wedding?

So, I (M28) have a complicated relationship with my sister (F30). We’ve always had a bit of a rivalry, but it’s become increasingly tense since she got engaged. She’s been planning her wedding for over a year, and I was happy for her, but I started feeling a bit left out of the process. Every time I tried to help, she would dismiss my suggestions and even laugh at some of my ideas, which made me feel undervalued.

Fast forward to the wedding day. I’m there, dressed up and trying to support her, but I can’t shake this feeling of resentment. During the reception, I overheard her and her husband talking about how they made the final decisions on the seating chart. They had placed me at a table with distant relatives I hardly know, while my sister’s best friend was sitting at the ‘fun’ table with all the people I actually know.

Feeling frustrated, I got a little tipsy and decided to confront her about it. I approached her during the speeches and made a comment about how I guess I wasn’t “important enough” to sit with the real family. She looked taken aback and tried to brush it off, but I kept pushing, saying how nice it was to be part of the family from a distance. It became awkward quickly, and guests were looking uncomfortable.

She ended up tearing up and left the room, and my parents were furious with me. They said I ruined her special day, and while I did apologize later, I also felt like my feelings were valid since I was trying to express how I felt excluded. Honestly, I was just trying to stand up for myself but might have gone about it the wrong way.

So, AITA for voicing my frustrations at my sister's wedding?",426,1673,0.69,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_90437,2022-12-18 00:00:00,ESH,1695,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My friend and I have been pretty close for years. We share a lot of interests and often hang out together, but there has been some tension lately. I’ve noticed that my friend has been struggling financially, and while I’m not wealthy, I do have a decent job and some savings. 

A few months ago, my friend approached me and asked if I could lend them some money to cover a few bills. I felt bad and agreed to lend them $300, but I made it clear that I needed it back within a month because I had some upcoming expenses of my own. They assured me they would pay me back.

As the month went by, I tried to be understanding, but I also followed up because I needed that money. They kept giving me excuses about unexpected expenses and promises that they would pay me back soon. I tried to be patient, but it started to feel like I was being taken advantage of. 

One day, while hanging out, I jokingly brought up the money. It was meant to be light-hearted, but my friend didn’t laugh. Instead, they got defensive and said they were working on it, but it wasn’t easy for them. I could tell they were upset, and I felt bad for bringing it up. 

A week later, I saw my friend post a picture on social media of them enjoying a night out with other friends, having a great time. I was honestly shocked and a little hurt because I was still waiting on my money. I decided to confront them about it. I sent a message saying something like, ""Must be nice to go out when you owe me money."" 

That did not go well. They responded angrily, saying that I had no idea what they were going through and that I was being insensitive. They accused me of being an opportunist for bringing up the loan again and for judging their social life. I felt a bit attacked, but I also realized I was being pretty harsh in my message too.

The conversation escalated, and I ended up saying some things I regretted, like how I felt they were irresponsible with their money and that they should prioritize paying me back. They fired back, saying they were trying to cope with their issues in their own way and that I was being a bad friend. 

Now, we’re both upset with each other, and our friendship is strained. I feel like I had a right to be frustrated about the money, but I also shouldn’t have taken it out on my friend. 

So, AITA for confronting my friend about the money and making them feel bad about their situation, or were they in the wrong for not paying me back and putting me in this position?

Everyone sucks here,"I'm part of a local community theater group, and we have a small but dedicated cast and crew. Recently, we decided to hold auditions for our upcoming play at a community center that we’ve used for years. We reserved the space well in advance, and everyone involved was excited.

On the day of the auditions, as we were setting up, a group of musicians arrived, claiming they had booked the same room for a rehearsal. Tensions escalated quickly as both groups insisted they had the rightful claim to the space. I tried to remain calm and suggested that we could share the room for a short time, since we had a couple of hours before our auditions officially started. The musicians were not receptive; they wanted the space entirely for their rehearsal.

After some back and forth, I offered to let them use the room, but only if we could have it back in time for our auditions. I thought this was a fair compromise given our prior booking. The musicians were frustrated and accused me of being inconsiderate, saying that it was our fault for not checking in with them first about the schedule. I argued back that we’d reserved the room and that it wasn’t our responsibility to monitor everyone else’s bookings.

Eventually, we reached a standstill where neither side was willing to budge. I could feel the tension in both groups rising, and it became clear that neither my cast nor their band was willing to give in. We ended up both having to leave the community center to cool off, and I felt terrible about how things escalated. 

In the end, we found another room a few blocks away for our auditions, but it was a lot of hassle, and I felt bad that we couldn’t cooperate better. I understand that the musicians were frustrated, but I also felt justified in defending our right to the space we had booked.

One of my coworkers, Jake, has been particularly stressed out. He's usually pretty upbeat, but lately, he’s been more irritable than usual. One day, during lunch, he started venting about how overwhelmed he feels, mentioning that he feels like he's carrying the entire weight of the project on his shoulders. I tried to lighten the mood by joking that maybe he should just take a ""mental health day"" and have a spa day instead.

Instead of laughing it off, Jake snapped at me, saying I had no idea what he was going through and that I was being insensitive. I was taken aback, but instead of apologizing, I defended myself, saying I was just trying to help him cope with his stress. The other coworkers, Sarah and Mia, seemed uncomfortable as they watched this unfold.

After our lunch break, I brought it up with Sarah and Mia, thinking maybe I had crossed a line. They told me that while Jake’s stress was valid, I also could have been more considerate in my attempt to lighten the mood. I felt hurt that they took his side over mine, but I also realized I might have come off as dismissive.

A few days later, I decided to make a light-hearted comment during a team meeting about how we should all be allowed to vent and have fun, but Jake interrupted me again, saying he just wanted to focus on the work and not be treated like a child. I responded with a sarcastic remark about how maybe we should all have ""adult time"" instead of the “fun time” he seemed to dislike. This made the atmosphere tense, and it didn't help that I felt like I was being ganged up on.

Now I’m left wondering if I was insensitive to Jake’s situation or if he was just overreacting. I feel like both of us contributed to the tension, and I’m not sure if I should apologize or just let it go.

He seemed nice enough, but I noticed some red flags—like how he would always interrupt her when she was talking and would dismiss her opinions. I thought maybe I was just being overprotective, so I kept my mouth shut.

A few weeks later, she invited me over for dinner to meet him. During the dinner, he was rude and made some snide comments about my job. I tried to brush it off, but I could see my friend was visibly uncomfortable. After dinner, I confronted her in private, saying I thought he was disrespectful and that she deserved better.

She got really upset with me, saying I was trying to control her and not respecting her choices. I was frustrated because I genuinely cared for her and wanted her to be treated well. At that point, I ended up yelling at her, saying she was being naive for staying with him. 

Things got heated, and I told her if she wanted to be with someone who treats her like that, then maybe we shouldn't be friends. I left her house feeling terrible but also justified in my concerns.

At first, I tried to ignore it, but they were so disruptive that I couldn’t help but overhear their conversation. It was clear that they were fighting about something serious, and I could see that other patrons were getting uncomfortable.

Eventually, the woman raised her voice and said something that made it sound like he had cheated on her. I felt really bad for her, and in the heat of the moment, I decided to intervene. I leaned over and said, “Hey, maybe you should just walk away from this conversation for now. It’s clearly not going anywhere good.” 

The guy shot me a glare and said, “Who the hell do you think you are? This is our business, not yours!” I snapped back, thinking I was doing the right thing, “Well, maybe if you weren’t making such a scene, you wouldn’t have to worry about strangers getting involved!”

This only escalated things further, and the woman ended up getting really upset and storming out of the coffee shop. I felt bad that I might have made the situation worse for her, but I also felt justified in wanting to stop what I thought was an unhealthy argument in a public space.

After she left, the guy started raising his voice again, saying things like “You’re just another nosy stranger!” and “Mind your own business!” I was so frustrated at this point that I called him out for not handling his relationship better and that it was no wonder she was upset.

Long story short, I left the coffee shop feeling like I had done the right thing, but I later wondered if I had overstepped my boundaries.

I wanted to be supportive and help her through the planning process, but I also felt an obligation to express my concerns. One evening, I brought it up during a casual dinner. I gently told her that I was worried she was making a hasty decision, and maybe she should reconsider. Lisa got extremely upset. She accused me of not being supportive and trying to sabotage her happiness. 

In the heat of the moment, I lashed out and told her that marrying Mark was a huge mistake and that I couldn’t support such a decision. I felt awful for saying that, but I was genuinely concerned for her well-being. She ended up in tears, and our dinner ended awkwardly. I apologized, but the damage was done. 

Now, Lisa is refusing to talk to me, and I feel terrible. I love my sister and want the best for her, but I also don’t want to stand by silently while she makes what I believe is a poor choice. I've tried reaching out, but she just ignores my messages.

At first, I was supportive and welcomed her into our home. I made an effort to get to know her and included her in our family gatherings. But over time, I noticed that she was quite critical of me—my cooking, my cleaning habits, even the way I decorated my room. I brushed it off initially, thinking maybe she was trying to bond, but it started to feel more like bullying.

One night, my brother had a few friends over, and I was trying to help out in the kitchen. His girlfriend made a comment about me being a ""bad cook"" in front of everyone, which embarrassed me. I confronted her in the moment and told her that she needed to stop being so rude. It escalated into a heated argument where I called her ""fake"" and said I didn’t understand what my brother saw in her. My brother intervened, saying I was out of line, and I stormed off.

Afterward, he told me I was being disrespectful and that I should have just let it go. I felt hurt that he didn’t stand up for me against his girlfriend’s comments. I ended up texting him that if he wanted to continue dating someone who disrespected his family, maybe he should reconsider how close we live together.

When my brother sent out the wedding invitations, he explicitly mentioned that he wanted a small, intimate ceremony and that only immediate family members could bring a plus-one. I totally understand wanting to keep the wedding small, but considering my partner and I have been together for a significant amount of time, I thought it was a bit unfair.

I decided to talk to my brother about it, hoping to convince him to let my partner come. I explained that he’s more than just a boyfriend to me; he’s part of the family in many ways. My brother was really firm and said he wanted to keep it just family and that it would be awkward for him to have more people there. I took it a bit personally, feeling like he was dismissing my relationship.

Jake has been really angry with me. He feels like I’m invading his privacy and treating him like a child, which I guess I am in a way. I thought I was doing what was best for him, but I can see that it’s pushing him further away. He’s started sneaking out at night, and I found out he’s been drinking at parties.

We invited a few close friends and planned a nice evening with some food and drinks. Our apartment is pretty cozy, so we made sure to keep the guest list limited to avoid overcrowding.

Everything was going well until one of our friends, Jake, showed up with his new girlfriend, whom none of us had met before. They entered and immediately started acting very loud and over-the-top, which was a bit off-putting to the rest of us who were trying to enjoy the evening. At first, we thought it was just their excitement, but it quickly became clear that they were not respecting the vibe we had set for the night.

As the evening progressed, Jake’s girlfriend began taking over the music and cranking the volume up way too high. I asked her politely to lower it a bit since it was starting to get overwhelming, especially with people trying to talk. She rolled her eyes and responded with a snarky comment about how we needed to ""loosen up"" and “have some fun.” It annoyed me, but I tried to stay calm and enjoy the evening.

Later on, they proceeded to start doing karaoke in the middle of our living room without considering that not everyone was on board with the idea. I felt frustrated and overwhelmed, and after a while, I snapped a little and told them to stop and that we were not doing karaoke in the apartment. Jake looked taken aback, and his girlfriend started arguing that we were ruining the fun. I ended up saying that if they wanted to sing and be loud, they should have gone to a bar instead of our home.

Tensions rose, and ultimately, Jake decided to leave with his girlfriend, muttering under his breath about how ungrateful we were. The rest of our guests felt awkward, and I ended up feeling bad for how I reacted. I could have handled it better, but I was also upset that they weren't respecting our space. Now I’m worried that I might have overreacted and ruined the night for everyone.",734,1176,0.95,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_26432,2023-02-01 00:00:00,ESH,2005,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I (30F) have a close friend, Lisa (32F), who has been struggling with her mental health for the past few years. She recently went through a rough breakup, and I offered to let her stay with me for a few weeks to help her get back on her feet. I thought it would be a good opportunity for us to bond and for me to support her.

However, after a week, things started to get tense. Lisa was often irritable and would snap at me over small things, like the way I loaded the dishwasher or how I organized the living room. I tried to be understanding, knowing she was going through a tough time, but it was hard to live with someone who seemed constantly on edge. 

One night, I came home from work and found her in my room going through my things. I was taken aback and told her to stop. She got defensive and accused me of not trusting her, which escalated into a heated argument. I said things I didn't mean, like how I wished I had never offered her a place to stay. She cried and left the room, and I felt terrible but also frustrated.

Later, I posted on social media about how difficult it was to support a friend with mental health issues. I didn't mention Lisa by name, but I described my feelings of being overwhelmed and unappreciated. That sparked a lot of comments from people who were concerned about both of us. 

Lisa saw the post and was hurt. She confronted me about it, saying I had betrayed her trust. I apologized, but the damage was done. We ended up fighting again, and both of us said things we regretted. I told her she was being unreasonable and she said I was being selfish for complaining about her struggles.

Now, we’re both feeling hurt and angry, and I’m not sure how to fix things. I thought I was trying to help, but I also feel like I overstepped and shouldn’t have aired my frustrations publicly. I don’t know if I’m justified in feeling overwhelmed or if I crossed a line by sharing my feelings online.",13,2889,0.63,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_60174,2018-03-30 00:00:00,ESH,1933,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I'm 25 years old and recently moved in with my girlfriend and her roommate. My girlfriend is really close with her roommate, and they have a lot of inside jokes that I often feel left out of. Sometimes, when I try to join the conversation or make a joke, they seem to ignore me or just laugh at each other instead.

One day, I was feeling particularly frustrated and made a sarcastic comment about how I could just disappear and they wouldn’t even notice. I thought it would be funny, but my girlfriend got upset and told me I was being rude and passive-aggressive. I tried to explain that I was just joking and wanted to be included, but it just made things worse.

The next few days were tense, and I started to withdraw from them both, feeling like I wasn’t welcome. I didn't want to always be the one trying to fit in, so I began to spend more time in my room.

Eventually, I overheard them talking about how I was sulking and how it was annoying. I felt hurt and responded by making some sarcastic comments to them when they were being overly friendly, which didn't help the situation. I know I shouldn't have reacted like that, but I was just trying to protect myself. 

Now, I feel like we’re all at fault here. I shouldn’t have made the comment that upset my girlfriend, but I also think they could have been more inclusive. It's just a really awkward situation right now.",330,1216,0.58,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_32797,2020-07-23 00:00:00,ESH,1380,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I’m a college student studying psychology, and I’m currently in a research methods class that requires us to work in groups to design an experiment. There are four of us in my group, and we’ve been working well together for most of the semester. We've had productive meetings and generally good communication.

However, one of my group members, let’s call him Jake, has been extremely difficult to work with. At first, he seemed engaged, but then he started missing meetings and didn’t contribute much to our discussions. We even had a few deadlines to submit parts of our project, and Jake consistently turned his sections in late or didn’t submit anything at all. The rest of us had to pick up the slack and cover for him.

As the weeks went by, it became clear that Jake was just not going to pull his weight. He would occasionally show up to meetings and give vague excuses about being overwhelmed with other classes or personal issues, but when we tried to talk about the project, he would often zone out or change the subject. It became frustrating because we were all putting in a lot of effort, and it didn’t seem fair that one person could drag the rest of us down.

The final straw was when we were just a week away from our project presentation, and Jake informed us that he had decided he wouldn’t be able to make the presentation at all. He claimed he had too much going on and wouldn’t be ready. This really upset me and the others because we had already made plans to divide the presenting parts based on what he had originally committed to.

In a moment of frustration, I decided to talk to our professor about the situation. I explained how much we had to manage due to Jake's lack of involvement. I expressed that while I understood he might be struggling, it felt unfair to have to carry his weight for the sake of the group project. The professor ended up discussing this with the whole class, and when it came time for our presentation, she ended up adjusting Jake's grade to reflect his lack of contribution.

After the presentation, I felt a mix of relief and guilt. I felt like I had done the right thing by speaking up about the issue, but I also knew that I had contributed to Jake’s situation and potentially hurt his chances of passing the class. The other group members were split; some felt I was justified, while others thought I should have just let it go and handled it internally.

So, after all this, I’m wondering: AITA for going to the professor about Jake’s lack of contribution?",763,822,0.99,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_56635,2018-05-29 00:00:00,ESH,2517,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I have been together for a few years now, and we often go out with friends or family for dinner. I enjoy these outings, but they can be pretty stressful for me because of my social anxiety. My partner knows this and usually tries to help me feel comfortable in these situations.

Last week, we had plans to meet up with her family for dinner. She had been talking about it for days, and I was feeling increasingly anxious about it. I decided that I didn’t want to go, but I didn't want to let her down. I ended up telling her that I was feeling sick instead of just admitting that I was anxious. I felt guilty about lying but thought it would spare her feelings.

She ended up going to dinner without me. During the dinner, she texted me a few times to check in, and I could see that she was having a good time with her family. I felt even worse about my decision to stay home. To make matters worse, I ended up scrolling through social media and saw pictures of them all having fun, which only made my anxiety worse.

When she got back home, she was upset with me for not being honest. We ended up having a heated discussion about it. I told her that I didn’t want to go because I was anxious, but she pointed out that I should have just communicated that instead of lying. I accused her of not understanding how hard it can be for someone with anxiety, and she claimed that if I had just told her the truth, she would have helped me find a way to feel more comfortable.

In the heat of the moment, we both said some hurtful things. I told her she was being selfish for wanting me to go out when I clearly wasn’t feeling up to it, and she told me I was being dishonest and that it was unfair to put that burden on her. We ended up going to bed angry at each other.

Everyone sucks here,"I recently had a pretty explosive argument with my neighbor over a parking space. We live in a condo complex with limited parking, and it’s always a bit of a struggle to find a good spot. For the past few months, I’ve been parking in the same spot that’s close to my unit, which I thought was fine.

Last week, I came home late from work and noticed that my neighbor had parked in ""my"" spot. I was frustrated, but I didn’t want to escalate things, so I parked a little further away. The next morning, I found a note on my car from my neighbor saying that I was being rude for taking his spot. I was taken aback because I thought I was just parking where I always had been, and I didn’t think I was being rude at all.

Instead of addressing it calmly, I let my anger get the best of me. I waited for him to come outside and then confronted him. I told him that I wasn’t going to let him dictate where I could park and that this was such a petty thing to fight over. He snapped back, saying that I was inconsiderate and that he had been parking there for a long time. We both ended up shouting at each other, and I threw in some personal insults about how he was always so uptight, which wasn’t really necessary but I was just so frustrated.

After the heated argument, I cooled down and felt guilty. I realized that I could have handled it differently. I could have just talked to him about it calmly and figured out a solution. But I also felt like he could have approached me in a better way instead of leaving a note. We both ended up escalating the situation rather than trying to resolve it amicably.

Instead of taking it well, she exploded on me, claiming I was being judgmental and that I had no right to tell her how to handle her money.

At first, I was supportive and welcomed her into our friend group. However, as time went on, I noticed that Emma has a habit of being overly controlling about Jake's time. If we planned a gaming night, she would often text him to come home early or cancel on us last minute. I get that he’s in a relationship, but it felt like she was trying to monopolize his time, and it started to annoy me.

One night, we finally planned a big gaming marathon for the weekend, and I was really looking forward to it. But on Saturday, Jake texted me to say he could only stay for half the night because Emma wanted him to come home for dinner with her parents. I snapped a little and told him he needed to stand up for himself and not let her dictate his time with friends. I might have gone too far and said something like, “You’re letting her run your life, man. It’s pathetic.”

Jake got defensive and told me I was being an asshole and didn’t understand his situation. I didn’t mean to push him away, but I was frustrated that our friendship felt like it was taking a backseat to his relationship.

Lisa had a huge crush on Tom during high school, and although she got over it, I could tell it still bothered her that we were now dating. I tried to be sensitive about it and made sure to include her in group activities. However, Lisa constantly made snide remarks about our relationship, like how Tom ""wasn't that great"" and how I could do better.

Lisa took this as the last straw and called me out in front of everyone, saying I was being inconsiderate for showing off our relationship when she was clearly uncomfortable.

In a moment of frustration, I told her that it wasn't about her having a great wedding but about the fact that I wanted my own day to be special, too.

Before the trip, I suggested that we all chip in to bring snacks and drinks. I was really looking forward to it and wanted to contribute by bringing some homemade cookies, which I love to bake. I even asked everyone ahead of time if they had any dietary restrictions, and everyone said no.

I felt a bit annoyed because she hadn’t mentioned being vegan before, and I thought she could have communicated that when we were planning.

I got defensive and said, “Well, not everyone here is vegan, and you could have brought your own snacks if you were worried.” This led to a bit of tension, as Sarah snapped back, saying I was being inconsiderate of her choices.

Everyone sucks here,"A few weeks ago, I had a family gathering at my parents' house. It was a big event, with cousins, aunts, and uncles coming together after a long time. Everyone was excited, and I was looking forward to catching up with family.

However, I have a habit of joking around a bit too much, especially in a lively setting. I often use sarcasm and dark humor, which not everyone appreciates. As the event went on, I started making jokes about our family’s history, poking fun at some of the more embarrassing moments and quirks of my relatives. I thought it was harmless fun, and some family members were laughing along, but I could see my aunt silently fuming in the corner.

My aunt has always been a bit sensitive about our family’s past, especially related to some unfortunate events that happened when we were younger. She eventually confronted me about my jokes, telling me I was being disrespectful and that I needed to stop. Instead of apologizing, I doubled down, insisting that it was all in good fun and that she was just being overly sensitive. I made a few more jokes that I thought were funny, which only seemed to upset her further.

After that, the mood of the gathering shifted. People were still on edge, and some of my cousins started to distance themselves from me. I realized that my humor had gone too far, but I was stubborn and continued to think I was in the right.

Eventually, my mom had to intervene and told me that I was ruining the day for everyone. I felt embarrassed and frustrated. I thought my jokes were just harmless, but I could see the hurt on my aunt’s face. I was also angry at her for not being able to take a joke.

Now I’m torn. I know I should have respected her feelings, but I also feel like she overreacted to what was meant to be light-hearted humor. 

So, AITA for joking around at a family gathering, or is everyone just being overly sensitive?",754,1884,0.59,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_67348,2021-08-15 00:00:00,ESH,1888,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I’m a college student and share an apartment with two friends, Tom and Sarah. We’ve been living together for about a year, and while we generally get along well, we’ve had our fair share of disagreements.

Recently, we decided to host a small gathering at our place for a few friends to unwind after finals. I took the initiative to organize everything — I cleaned the apartment, bought snacks and drinks, and set up the music. However, as the night progressed, I noticed that Tom seemed to be in a bad mood. He was making snide comments about the music and rolling his eyes at some of our friends.

At one point, he got particularly rude and called one of our guests “annoying” for trying to engage him in conversation. I tried to diffuse the situation by jokingly telling him to lighten up, but he only got angrier. I was starting to feel embarrassed and frustrated by his behavior, especially since I had put a lot of effort into making the night enjoyable.

In a moment of anger, I snapped and told him he was acting like a “grumpy old man” and that if he didn’t want to be there, he could just leave. I also said he was ruining the vibe of the party. Tom shot back, saying I was being overly dramatic and that my expectations for the night were unrealistic.

Sarah, trying to mediate, ended up getting caught in the crossfire. She sided with Tom, saying I was being unnecessarily harsh. This only escalated tensions, and eventually, Tom left the gathering early, visibly upset.

Looking back, I realize I probably overreacted to Tom's behavior. He was in a bad mood for personal reasons I didn’t know about, but I also think he could have been more considerate of the situation, especially since it was my effort that made the gathering happen.

So, AITA for snapping at Tom during my own gathering, or is he the one being an asshole for ruining the night?",797,2976,0.94,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_34159,2023-08-27 00:00:00,ESH,1861,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I (30M) recently had a falling out with my sister (28F) over a family event that spiraled out of control, and I’m not sure who is in the wrong here. My sister and I were very close growing up, but things have been tense since she got married two years ago. Her husband (30M) is a good guy, but he tends to dominate conversations and makes a lot of jokes at the expense of others.

Last month, we had a family reunion, and during dinner, my sister's husband made a joke about how I’m the “black sheep” of the family because I’m still single and focused on my career. It didn’t bother me too much, but my sister laughed a little too hard and added, “Yeah, at least someone in the family knows how to have fun!” It stung a bit, but I brushed it off.

Later in the evening, when everyone was playing games, I decided to poke a little fun back at him. I jokingly said, “Hey, at least I can still date without checking with my ‘fun police’,” and everyone laughed. My sister didn’t find it funny, though. She got visibly upset and told me to stop making fun of her husband, which surprised me because I thought we were just joking around.

Things escalated quickly. I told her she was being overly sensitive and that I was just playing along with the banter. She left the room in tears, and my parents started to take her side, saying I should have known better than to joke about her husband. I felt really hurt because I felt like I was just trying to lighten the mood.

After the reunion, my sister texted me saying she was disappointed in how I treated her husband and that I was crossing a line. I told her that I felt hurt by her comments and that it was unfair to call me out when I was just responding to the teasing. We haven’t spoken since, and our parents are caught in the middle, trying to mediate.

Everyone sucks here,"I (35M) recently had a pretty tense family dinner with my wife (34F) and our teenage son (16M). It was his birthday, and we agreed to celebrate at a restaurant he loves. However, things took a turn when we got there.

My wife was already in a mood because she had a stressful day at work, and our son was acting a bit distant, likely because his friends were out celebrating without him. I tried to lighten the atmosphere by joking around and suggesting we order a bunch of appetizers to share. But my wife snapped at me, saying I was making a big deal out of nothing and that I should stop trying to force fun when it wasn’t there.

Our son chimed in, clearly feeling uncomfortable, and said, “Can we just eat in peace?” which only escalated tensions. Instead of handling it calmly, I brought up a previous incident where my wife had also ruined a family dinner with her negativity. I probably shouldn’t have said it like that, but I was frustrated. My wife took offense and accused me of airing our dirty laundry in front of our son, which only made me more defensive. 

The dinner went downhill from there. I ended up arguing with my wife about how she always focuses on the negative, while she accused me of not supporting her when she’s stressed. My son just sat there, looking embarrassed and uncomfortable. After a while, I suggested we just get dessert and leave, but at that point, the mood was completely ruined.

The next day, my son told me he felt caught in the middle and that our argument ruined his birthday. I realized that neither of us handled the situation well. I should have supported my wife instead of bringing up past grievances, and she could have been more understanding about how to keep the night enjoyable for our son.

Everyone sucks here,"Me (17F) and my best friend (18F) have been inseparable since middle school. We share everything, from our deepest secrets to our wildest dreams. However, recently our friendship has been tested because of a boy (19M) we both like. Let's call him Jake. 

At first, I thought it was harmless when my friend mentioned that she found Jake attractive. I said I thought he was cute too, but I didn't think much of it. However, as time went on, it became clear that she was developing a crush on him. I liked him too, but I was willing to step back and let her have a shot since she's been single for a while.

Things got complicated when Jake started showing interest in me. He would text me, compliment me, and we hung out a few times. I told my friend about it, and she seemed supportive at first. However, I could see the jealousy creeping in. 

One night, we were all at a party together, and my friend had a few too many drinks. In a moment of frustration, she started yelling at me for leading Jake on and not giving her a fair chance. I was shocked and hurt. I told her that I hadn’t meant to hurt her and that it was Jake’s choice to pursue me. She called me selfish and said I was ruining our friendship over a guy. 

In response, I lashed out and said she was being overly dramatic and that it wasn’t my fault she couldn’t handle her feelings. We ended up having a massive fight in front of everyone, and it made things awkward for the rest of the night. 

After the party, she didn’t want to talk to me, and I felt guilty for how things escalated. I tried to reach out and apologize, but she didn’t want to hear it. I realize now that I should have been more sensitive to her feelings, but I also feel that she shouldn't have put all the blame on me when Jake was the one making the decisions. 

Now, both of us are upset, and our friendship feels strained. I don’t know if I acted selfishly or if she was overreacting. I guess we both played a part in ruining what we had.",87,2032,0.7,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_44657,2022-10-28 00:00:00,ESH,1979,AITA

Last week, she invited me over to meet her new boyfriend. I was excited and wanted to show support, but when I got there, I noticed he was very different from her usual type. He seemed nice enough, but he had some questionable views about relationships and family, which made me uncomfortable. During dinner, he made a few offhand comments about how women should be more submissive in relationships, and I couldn’t just let it go. 

After dinner, I tried to express my concerns to my sister privately. I told her that I didn’t think he was a good match for her and that I was worried about some of the things he said.

Recently, we decided to host a small gathering to celebrate the end of exams. We set a date and invited a few close friends, which we all agreed upon. However, the day before the gathering, J mentioned wanting to invite a large group of people from his class. I was a bit hesitant because our apartment isn’t huge, and I wanted to keep the vibe intimate and manageable. I expressed my concerns, but J insisted that it would be fun and that he could handle it. 

Feeling frustrated, I went to K for support. K seemed to agree with me that a smaller gathering would be better, and we both asked J to stick to the original plan. J got defensive and said that it was his right to invite who he wanted since he lived there too. I was annoyed, but I didn’t want to escalate things, so I reluctantly agreed to let J invite a few more people, but I asked him to keep it under control.

Fast forward to the party, and J really went all out. He invited way more people than we discussed, and our apartment was packed. I felt overwhelmed and anxious, especially since I had prepared food and drinks for a much smaller crowd. K tried to help out, but with the noise and the chaos, I couldn't enjoy the evening at all. At one point, I snapped and told J that he was being inconsiderate and ruining the night for everyone, which led to a heated argument.

K, trying to mediate, ended up getting sucked into our argument, and they both threw some accusations back and forth. J accused me of being uptight and not knowing how to have fun, while I called him irresponsible for not respecting the boundaries we originally set. K felt caught in the middle and ended up saying that we both needed to chill out and stop taking things so seriously.

In the end, the party was a mess, and I felt guilty for losing my cool in front of our friends. I just wanted everyone to have a good time, but I think we all contributed to the chaos in some way. Now I'm left wondering if I overreacted or if J truly crossed a line.

My sister made a beautiful cake, and everyone was excited to try it. Just after she cut the first slice, one of my cousins, Jake, who has a severe nut allergy, asked if there were any nuts in the cake. My sister assured him there were none, and we all relaxed. But then, out of nowhere, my other cousin, Sarah, who often likes to joke around, said, “Well, if there were nuts, I guess we’d find out soon enough!” 

Jake was visibly uncomfortable and asked her to stop joking about it. Sarah laughed it off, thinking it was all in good fun, but Jake got really upset and told her to take his allergy seriously. At that point, I chimed in and told Sarah to stop being insensitive. Instead of backing down, she snapped at me, claiming I was overreacting and that Jake needed to lighten up.

Lisa has a reputation for being a bit dramatic and has clashed with Matt in the past over personal issues. When she arrived, she immediately started making comments about the decorations and how it should’ve been more ""festive."" I could see Matt getting visibly annoyed, but I tried to brush it off, thinking she was just being her usual self.

Instead, she got really upset and confronted me. She said that it was rude to leave notes and that I should have just talked to her directly instead of publicly airing my grievances. I ended up getting defensive, and we had a huge argument where I accused her of being inconsiderate and she accused me of being passive-aggressive. 

To make things worse, our other roommate (25M) tried to mediate but ended up getting dragged into the argument, pointing out that we both could have handled things better. Now, the living room feels tense, and we all avoid each other.

I’ve tried to support him, but it’s been hard because he often gets very negative and brings down the mood around him. I understand he’s going through a rough time, but sometimes I feel like I can’t be around him without feeling drained.

Sarah, on the other hand, has been incredibly supportive of Matt. She encourages him to talk about his feelings and tries to lift his spirits. I appreciate that she’s there for him, but I feel like she’s become overly involved in his issues, to the point where it sometimes feels like I’m losing her attention. I’m not the most emotionally expressive person, and it’s frustrating to see her spend so much time comforting Matt while I feel a bit neglected.

I snapped and told them both that it’s okay to feel down, but we can’t let it ruin every gathering we have. I said that while I care about Matt, he needs to work on his issues and not drag everyone down with him.

My partner immediately offered to let them crash with us for a few weeks while they get back on their feet. I wasn't thrilled about it. We have a small apartment, and I value my space and privacy. I expressed my concerns to my partner, but they insisted it was the right thing to do.

They would often leave dirty dishes in the sink, use our food without asking, and play loud music late at night. I tried to address these issues by talking to them, but it just resulted in arguments.

Eventually, I snapped and had a big fight with my partner, where I said I felt like a doormat and that their sibling was taking advantage of our kindness. My partner accused me of being unsupportive and cold-hearted. It ended with a lot of hurt feelings on both sides and their sibling deciding to leave earlier than planned.

As the deadline approached, I realized I wasn't going to make it in time, and I felt terrible about letting her down. Instead of communicating this to her, I thought I could pull an all-nighter and just get it done. I ended up staying up late, but I was so exhausted that I ended up falling asleep and missed the deadline entirely.

The next day, I woke up to a barrage of messages from Sarah, who was understandably upset because she needed the materials printed for her event. In a panic, I tried to salvage the situation and rushed to finish everything, but it wasn't my best work. When I sent it over, Sarah responded with frustration, saying that I had let her down and that she couldn't use what I provided because it looked rushed.

Feeling defensive, I lashed out and told her that she should have understood I was busy and that I didn't owe her anything since I was doing it for free. This turned into a heated argument, where both of us said things we regretted. I felt bad for not being upfront about my workload, and she felt hurt that I didn’t prioritize her needs as a friend.

In the end, we both apologized, but things were strained between us. I know I shouldn’t have reacted the way I did, and Sarah could have communicated her needs better too. I feel like we both contributed to the mess, and now I’m left wondering if we can repair our friendship.",111,795,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_11318,2024-04-29 00:00:00,ESH,1862,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I've been friends with Sarah for over a decade, and while we’ve had our ups and downs, I’ve always valued our friendship. Recently, though, things have become complicated. Sarah has been going through a rough patch with her job and is generally feeling pretty down about life. I wanted to support her, but honestly, I was also dealing with my own stress from work and personal issues.

A couple of weeks ago, Sarah confided in me that she was feeling overwhelmed and was struggling with her mental health. I did my best to listen and offer support, but it was hard for me to focus, as I had my own problems weighing on me. I suggested she look into therapy or support groups, which she seemed to brush off. I understand that therapy isn't for everyone, but I felt like I was trying to help her find a solution.

Then, one night while out with some friends, I overheard Sarah talking to someone else about how I wasn't being supportive enough and how I was dismissing her feelings. This really hurt me, especially because I had been trying to be there for her. In a moment of frustration, I confronted her about it, and instead of just talking it out, we ended up having a heated argument. I said some things I probably shouldn’t have, while she accused me of being selfish.

After that, I felt guilty about how things escalated, so I sent her a message apologizing for my part in the argument and tried to express that I wanted to be there for her. She responded, but it was clear she was still upset, and she said she needed space. 

I decided to reach out to some of our mutual friends to explain my side of the story, hoping they could mediate between us or understand where I was coming from. However, I realized that this might have been a mistake, as it only seemed to make things worse. Some of them started taking sides, and I could sense a divide forming in our friend group. 

Now it feels like everyone is caught in the middle and tensions are high. I wish I had just talked to Sarah directly instead of dragging others into it, and she regrets the way she handled things too. We both contributed to the mess, and now it feels like our friendship is hanging by a thread, with both of us feeling hurt and misunderstood.",869,2818,0.53,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_49966,2021-03-25 00:00:00,ESH,2229,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"For context: My sister (27f) has been planning her wedding for over a year now, and it's been a bit of a rollercoaster. I'm (25f) the maid of honor, and while I’m excited for her, I’ve also been feeling a lot of pressure to make everything perfect. 

A few weeks ago, she asked me to help out with the seating chart, which has turned into a huge point of contention between her and our parents. After a long evening of discussing and rearranging names, I suggested that maybe we should consider seating some family members at different tables to avoid conflicts. She got really upset and accused me of not understanding how important these relationships were to her. I didn’t mean to upset her; I was just trying to help.

The night of the rehearsal dinner, everything came to a head. I was feeling stressed about the seating arrangement and the fact that she hadn’t taken any of my suggestions seriously. During the dinner, I noticed that she had seated our uncle and cousin, who have had a longstanding feud, at the same table. I pointed this out to her quietly, but she blew up at me in front of everyone, saying I was ruining her special day. I snapped back, saying she was ignoring advice that could save her from a potential disaster. 

After the dinner, I was really hurt and sent her a long text explaining how I felt unappreciated as the maid of honor and that I was just trying to look out for her. She responded with a message saying she didn’t need my negativity and that I was making everything harder for her. 

Now, we're both feeling hurt and upset. I think I was trying to help her, but I also realize that I could have approached things differently, especially during her wedding week.

Everyone sucks here,"I have a close-knit group of friends, and we all decided to have a weekend getaway at a cabin in the woods. There are five of us: me, my boyfriend, and three of our friends. Over the years, we've had an unspoken rule that if someone can't handle the vibe anymore or starts acting in a way that brings everyone down, we should talk about it. 

One of our friends, Sarah, has been struggling with anxiety and has had a few outbursts during our hangouts before. It's not that we don’t care about her; we do. But her outbursts can be really intense. For example, during a recent game night, she snapped at another friend for making a joke about her favorite show. It turned into a full-blown argument, and she ended up leaving early in tears. 

When we were planning this cabin trip, there was a conversation about how we wanted to keep things light and fun, especially since we had all been looking forward to it for so long. During the planning, I mentioned to the group that I wasn't sure if inviting Sarah was a good idea, given her past behavior. I know it sounds harsh, but I was worried that if she got triggered again, it would ruin the weekend for everyone.

In the end, we decided not to invite her. We sent her a message saying that we were going on a trip and didn’t include her in the plans. I thought it was for the best, but then my boyfriend felt guilty and told me we should have invited her anyway. He ended up sending her a message saying we’d be going without her. She was really hurt and felt betrayed, saying she thought we were all friends.

Now, my boyfriend and I are at odds over this. I feel justified for wanting a peaceful trip, but at the same time, I feel bad for not considering Sarah's feelings more. I just wanted us all to have a good time. My boyfriend thinks we should have been more inclusive and at least offered her the chance to come. 

So now I'm left wondering: Are we the assholes for excluding Sarah from the trip? Or was I right to prioritize the group's vibe over potential drama?",699,654,0.91,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_87250,2020-07-22 00:00:00,ESH,2023,AITA

A couple of weeks ago, I (28M) was invited to a dinner party at a friend’s house. This friend, Mark (30M), has been a close friend for years, but he has a tendency to be a bit overbearing and is notorious for making jokes at others' expense. I usually let it slide, but I was feeling a bit sensitive lately due to personal issues.

At this dinner, Mark decided it would be funny to make jokes about everyone's cooking skills. He started with the appetizers and then moved on to the main course. I had made a special dish that I was really proud of, but as soon as Mark took a bite, he made a face and said something like, “What is this? Did you forget to season it, or are you trying to kill us with bland food?” Everyone laughed, but I felt embarrassed and hurt.

Instead of taking it in stride, I snapped back and said, “At least I’m not the one who burnt the lasagna last week, Mark!” This caught him off guard, and he got defensive, claiming I was being too sensitive. The atmosphere got tense for a moment, and I could see some guests looking awkwardly at each other.

After that, he started to make fun of me for being “overly dramatic” and said I should just take a joke. I retaliated by bringing up some of his previous mishaps during cooking, which also got laughs, but I could tell it was going too far. 

Later in the evening, we both tried to smooth things over, but it was pretty clear that the vibe was off. A mutual friend told us both that we needed to chill and not ruin the evening. In retrospect, I probably should have just let his comment slide instead of firing back, and he really should have known better than to make fun of my food, especially since he knows I’ve been feeling down.

So, was I the asshole for snapping back at Mark, or is he also in the wrong for making a joke that hurt my feelings? 

TL;DR: I snapped at a friend who made a joke about my cooking, and it turned into a back-and-forth that ruined the dinner party atmosphere.",897,1138,0.51,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_51287,2023-07-13 00:00:00,ESH,2026,AITA

However, during the reception, I noticed a few of my friends getting a bit rowdy at the bar.

As the night progressed, I ended up drinking way too much and made a fool of myself on the dance floor, embarrassing my sister in front of her new in-laws. At one point, I even grabbed the mic and started making a speech about how great I am, which I thought would be funny but clearly wasn’t. My sister looked mortified and tried to get me to stop, but I was too far gone to realize how out of control I was.

She’s always been someone who seeks my opinion on everything, and I’ve tried to be supportive. However, the pressure has been mounting, especially since we have a big family that tends to have strong opinions about weddings. 

A few weeks ago, she asked me to be her maid of honor. I agreed, thinking it would be a fun experience for us to share, but then she started bombarding me with tasks. She insists that I help her with every detail, from choosing the venue to picking out dresses, and I’m starting to feel suffocated. I have my own life, a demanding job, and I’ve been dealing with personal issues that I haven’t shared with her because I don’t want to burden her.

Last weekend, during one of our planning sessions, I snapped. I told her that it felt like she was treating me more like a wedding planner than a sister. I also expressed my frustrations about how much pressure I felt from our family to make everything perfect. She got really upset and accused me of being unsupportive and selfish. I immediately felt guilty because I do want her to have a beautiful wedding, but I also felt like my feelings were valid.

Last week, I was hanging out at Sarah’s place, and while we were chatting, she received a text notification from a contact named ""Jessie ❤️"". She smiled, opened the message, and started replying while I was talking. This seemed a bit off to me, since she had mentioned a couple of times that her last relationship had ended badly, and I figured she wouldn’t be texting someone like that during our hangout. 

I casually asked her who Jessie was, and she turned a bit red and said it was just a friend. I pressed a little more, thinking nothing of it, and she got defensive, saying I was being nosy. I pointed out that it was strange to have someone with a heart emoji in their contact name if they were “just a friend.” Sarah insisted it was no big deal and that I was overreacting.

I then asked if I could see her phone just for that specific conversation, thinking it might put my mind at ease. She flat-out refused and said I was invading her privacy. I argued that if she had nothing to hide, what was the harm in letting me see it? She got really upset, saying that I didn’t trust her and that I was acting unreasonably.

The argument escalated, and I may have raised my voice, which I regret. In the heat of the moment, I accused her of not valuing our friendship if she couldn’t be honest with me.

However, I noticed that L hasn't been very involved in planning or cooking meals, which was fine at first, but it started to feel unbalanced. I tried to bring it up casually, but L often brushes it off, claiming she’s just too tired.

A few weeks ago, I decided to take it upon myself to plan a special dinner for us, hoping it would spark some interest in cooking together. I spent the whole day preparing a nice meal, complete with dessert. When L got home, she seemed frustrated about something that happened at work and barely acknowledged the effort I put into the dinner. After a while, L snapped at me for not making her favorite dish, saying, “I can’t believe you made all this and didn’t even think to ask me what I wanted!”

I felt hurt and upset since I had put so much effort into the meal, and instead of appreciating it, L was angry. I told her that I wished she would have communicated her preferences better instead of reacting like this. We ended up arguing, and in the heat of the moment, I called her ungrateful for not recognizing my efforts.

After the argument, I felt bad about how I reacted and tried to apologize. L, however, was still upset and accused me of being overly sensitive and not understanding the pressure she’s under at work. We both ended up giving each other the silent treatment for a couple of days, and it created a tense atmosphere in our home.

Eventually, we talked things out, but I still feel like we both could have handled the situation better. I wish she could have acknowledged my efforts, and I regret how I reacted and called her ungrateful. It makes me wonder if we both contributed to the conflict more than we should have.",93,2156,0.68,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_76529,2020-06-14 00:00:00,ESH,1877,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I (28M) recently had a falling out with my sister (30F) over how we handled our parents' anniversary dinner. Our parents have been married for over 30 years, and every year we try to make it special for them. This year, my sister and I were supposed to plan it together, but things got a bit messy.

For context, I’ve been juggling a demanding job and my own family, including my wife and two kids (4 and 2). My sister, on the other hand, has more free time and is very organized. She took the lead on planning the dinner and asked me to help with the food and drinks.

While I agreed to help, I got overwhelmed with work and only managed to bring a few bottles of wine and some desserts. My sister went all out, planning a full meal, decorating the house, and even organizing a slideshow of our parents’ memories. 

On the day of the dinner, my wife and kids got ill, and I had to stay home to take care of them. I let my sister know I wouldn’t be able to make it, but I felt terrible because I didn’t want her to have to handle everything solo. 

When I found out the dinner went well, I was genuinely happy for her, but I also felt a bit hurt that she didn’t acknowledge my effort at all. A couple of days later, I texted her to thank her for all the hard work she put into the dinner, but I also expressed that I wished she had asked for my help more explicitly instead of assuming I would be able to do everything. 

She completely lost it on me and said I was being selfish and that I should have prioritized the dinner over my job and family. I snapped back, saying she didn’t have to take on everything herself and that I felt unappreciated. 

Now, we’re not speaking, and I feel like both of us went too far. I don’t think I was wrong to be frustrated, but I also realize I could’ve been more supportive instead of reacting defensively.

So, AITA for how I handled the situation with my sister?",551,1877,0.7,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_86681,2023-06-02 00:00:00,ESH,1903,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, I'm feeling a bit conflicted about a situation that happened recently and could use some perspective.

A few weeks ago, I organized a small get-together with some friends to celebrate a birthday. It was supposed to be a fun night with games, food, and drinks. I put a lot of effort into planning it, and I wanted everyone to have a great time.

During the party, we started playing a party game that involves sharing funny stories, and that's when things took a turn. One of my friends, let's call him Mark, shared a pretty personal story about a tough time he went through. While I thought it was brave of him to open up, I didn’t really know how to respond, and awkwardness hung in the air.

To lighten the mood, I joked about how we should all share embarrassing moments instead, thinking it would bring back the fun vibe. But Mark didn’t take it well and said that not everything has to be a joke and that we should be more sensitive to each other's feelings. I felt a bit defensive, so I replied, “Well, if we can’t laugh about things, what’s the point?”

Things got uncomfortable, and the atmosphere shifted. Some of my other friends tried to back me up, saying it was all in good fun, while others sided with Mark, saying I was being insensitive. The night ended up being kind of tense, and a few people left early.

Now I’m stuck wondering if I was too harsh on Mark. I didn’t mean to upset him, but I also felt like I was just trying to keep things light. I know I could have handled it better, but I also think Mark could have been a bit more understanding. So, AITA for trying to keep the mood light, or is Mark overreacting?",325,1510,0.76,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_79851,2021-07-11 00:00:00,ESH,1640,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I’ve been friends with Sarah for over five years, and for the most part, we get along really well. We often hang out in a group with some other friends, but I’ve noticed that Sarah can be a bit of a know-it-all. She loves to share her opinions, and while I appreciate her passion, it sometimes comes off as condescending.

Recently, our friend group decided to go on a camping trip. We were all excited, and Sarah offered to organize everything. I thought it was great that she was taking charge, but I also noticed that she was making all the decisions without consulting anyone. She picked the campsite, planned the meals, and even decided what activities we would do.

On the first night, we were sitting around the campfire, and Sarah started talking about her favorite hiking trails. She went on and on about how she was an expert and how we should all follow her lead. I felt frustrated because I had my own ideas about what we could do. 

I decided to speak up, saying, “Hey, I think it would be fun to check out the lake tomorrow instead of hiking. We could swim and relax.” Sarah immediately shot me down, saying, “No, we’re going hiking. It’s the best way to experience nature.” I felt dismissed, and in a moment of frustration, I snapped back, “You don’t have to be such a control freak, you know! It's not all about you!”

The group fell silent, and Sarah looked hurt. I realized I might have overreacted, but I also felt like I was just trying to express my opinion. After that, there was a bit of tension between us, and the rest of the trip felt awkward. 

Later, Sarah told me that I had embarrassed her in front of everyone and that I should have just let her lead. I apologized for my tone but maintained that I thought everyone should have a say in our plans. Our friends were split; some agreed with me, saying Sarah can be too controlling, while others thought I was rude for calling her a control freak.

I feel torn about the whole situation. I don’t want to damage our friendship, but I also think everyone should be able to voice their ideas without feeling shut down. So, am I the asshole for calling Sarah a control freak, or was she being too bossy? ESH?",126,2963,0.9,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_63326,2020-05-29 00:00:00,ESH,2182,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I (28F) work in a collaborative office environment, and we have a team of about 10 people. Recently, we were assigned a big project that required everyone to contribute their skills. I've always been the one to take on a lot of the workload, partly because I genuinely enjoy what I do and partly because I feel an obligation to make sure everything is done well.

One of my coworkers, Alex (25M), is known for slacking off. He often shows up late, and when he does contribute, it’s usually not up to the standard we expect. I've had several frustrating encounters with him where I felt I had to pick up the slack, which has only added to my resentment toward him.

As we were nearing a deadline for this project, I noticed that Alex was not doing his fair share. He would often leave early, and when we had team meetings, he seemed disengaged. I decided to take matters into my own hands and started working extra hours to cover for him, thinking that I was helping the team succeed.

Fast forward to the project presentation, and Alex ended up taking credit for a lot of the work that I did. He even praised himself during the presentation, making it sound like he was heavily involved when in reality, I was the one who put in all the effort. I felt furious and betrayed, but instead of just confronting him, I decided to vent my frustrations to a few of our other teammates.

During our discussions, I mentioned how I felt about Alex's lack of contribution and how unfair it was for him to take credit for my work. A couple of teammates agreed with me and said they had noticed similar issues with him before. That led to a group decision to talk to our manager about it.

On the day we planned to speak to our manager, I found out that Alex had overheard our conversations and was understandably upset. He confronted me, accusing me of trying to sabotage him and stir up trouble. I told him that he brought this on himself by not pulling his weight. The confrontation escalated, and I ended up saying some hurtful things that I regretted later.

In the end, our manager had to mediate between us, and while they recognized that Alex wasn't being a team player, they also told me that I should have handled the situation more professionally rather than gossiping and trying to gather support against him.

So, now I’m left wondering if I was justified in my actions or if I just made the situation worse for everyone involved. AITA for wanting to hold him accountable and venting about it, or did I go too far?",683,2535,0.91,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_25554,2021-06-24 00:00:00,ESH,2513,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, my best friend and I have been close since childhood. We’ve always been there for each other through everything, and I consider her like a sister. A few months ago, she started dating this guy, who seems nice enough, but I’ve had some concerns about him. He tends to be a bit controlling, and I’ve noticed he discourages her from hanging out with anyone else, including me.

I tried to voice my concerns to her, but she brushed them off, insisting that he’s just protective and that I’m being dramatic. I respect her choices, but it’s hard to watch my friend change so much. She used to be so free-spirited and fun, and now it feels like she’s almost a different person.

A few weeks ago, she invited me to a small get-together at her place with her boyfriend. I was excited, thinking it would be a chance to reconnect, but when I got there, things felt off. He was very clingy, and whenever we tried to have a conversation, he interrupted or made snide comments.

I ended up getting frustrated and had a bit too much to drink. In the heat of the moment, I made a joke about him being too controlling and said something like, “Maybe it’s time for you to let her breathe a little.” It was meant to be light-hearted, but it didn’t go over well. He got really defensive, and she looked hurt.

After that night, she texted me saying I disrespected her and her relationship, and that I should have kept my opinions to myself. I felt guilty, but at the same time, I thought I was just trying to protect her. I ended up apologizing, but I also told her I was worried about her and that I didn’t want to see her in a situation where she wasn’t happy.

Now, we’re in a weird place. I feel like I was trying to look out for her, but maybe I overstepped. She thinks I’m being an asshole for not supporting her relationship, and I’m starting to wonder if I was out of line.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I want to share a story that’s been weighing on my mind for a while, and I’m not sure if I handled it poorly or if I was justified. 

This happened a year ago when I was 17F. My best friend, Lily, had been going through a tough time with her mental health. She was really open about it, which I appreciated, but it also made it hard for me sometimes because I felt like I had to tiptoe around her feelings. 

One day, we were hanging out at my place, and out of nowhere, she started talking about how she always felt like a burden to her family and friends. I could tell she was really upset, and I tried to console her by saying that everyone has their struggles and that she wasn't a burden. I thought I was being supportive, but then I made a comment about how I sometimes feel down too, and I have to deal with my own issues, like school stress and family drama. 

Lily didn’t take this well at all. She accused me of trying to downplay her feelings and make everything about me. I honestly didn’t mean it that way, but I could see she was hurt. In the heat of the moment, I snapped back, saying that it felt one-sided and that I was tired of always having to listen to her problems without her ever asking how I was doing. I knew it wasn’t the best thing to say, but I felt frustrated and overwhelmed, and I just let it out. 

After that, she got really quiet and left my house without saying much. I felt terrible afterward because I never wanted to hurt her feelings or make her feel worse. However, part of me felt like I also had a right to express my own struggles. 

Now I’m conflicted about whether I handled it poorly or if she overreacted. I know we both contributed to the argument, and I feel like we both could have communicated better.

We both work full-time, but we wanted to ensure that the apartment stayed clean and organized without one person feeling overwhelmed. We agreed that we would each handle specific tasks and alternate weeks for others.

Initially, things went smoothly. I took care of the cooking and grocery shopping, while she handled laundry and vacuuming. However, as time went on, I noticed she wasn't keeping up her end of the agreement as much. The laundry started piling up, and the vacuuming wasn't done regularly. I tried to address this calmly, suggesting we adjust our responsibilities if things were getting too hectic for her.

Instead of discussing it, she became defensive and accused me of being controlling and nitpicky. I admit that I got frustrated and snapped at her, saying that I felt like I was doing all the work while she was neglecting her responsibilities. This led to a heated argument where we both said hurtful things. I called her lazy, and she said I was being too uptight. 

Since that argument, neither of us has effectively addressed the issue again. I still feel overwhelmed with the chores while she hasn’t changed her behavior. I know I could handle things better, but I also think she should step up more.

Everyone sucks here,"A few months ago, my younger brother, Alex, got married. The whole family was excited, and I was genuinely happy for him. However, I had my own wedding planned for next year, and I was looking forward to a small, intimate ceremony with close friends and family. 

As we started discussing the wedding details, I mentioned to my parents that I was considering a specific venue that had a special meaning to me. This venue was also the place where my parents had their wedding years ago. I thought it would be a nice homage to family traditions. My parents were supportive and encouraged me to book it.

However, a couple of weeks later, I found out that my brother and his new wife also wanted to have their reception at the same venue, but they never mentioned it to me before. When I confronted them about it, they said they didn’t think I would mind since my wedding was still a year away. I felt really hurt; this was a personal connection for me, and sharing it felt like they were undermining the significance of my own wedding.

In the heat of the moment, I blew up at Alex and told him that it was incredibly selfish to take the venue I had already mentioned to our parents. He got defensive, saying I was being dramatic and that it was just a venue. I then turned to my parents and expressed my disappointment that they didn’t think to remind Alex this was important to me. They ended up getting caught in the middle and told us both to calm down.

After that, we all went our separate ways, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that my brother and parents were being insensitive.

The thing is, I've always been into cooking too — I took culinary classes in high school and have been refining my skills for years. I know for a fact that Steve hasn’t worked in a professional kitchen, and his ""gourmet meals"" are usually just mediocre dishes he learned from TV shows.

One day, we were having a team potluck at work, and Steve was really pushing his dish — a fancy-looking pasta. He was going on and on about how it would steal the show and how everyone would be begging for his recipes. I tried to be supportive, but it was hard listening to him boast when I knew he wasn't all that great in the kitchen.

When the potluck started, I brought my homemade lasagna, which has always been a hit at gatherings. As everyone started tasting the food, Steve was still acting like he was the star of the show. But when people tried my lasagna, they couldn't stop raving about it. That’s when I jokingly said, “I guess my lasagna has officially outdone your gourmet pasta!” I thought it was all in good fun, but Steve got super defensive and said I was just trying to undermine him.

I admitted that I didn’t like how he always exaggerated his abilities, and he told me I was being arrogant for pointing it out.

I consider myself to be a social person and love having friends over for dinner parties or game nights. My partner, on the other hand, is much more introverted and often finds social gatherings overwhelming.

While camping, I had a fantastic time – we hiked, cooked over the fire, and enjoyed some much-needed male bonding. But throughout the trip, I kept thinking about how I had deceived Sarah. When I got back, I was met with a mix of excitement from Luke and silence from Sarah. She confronted me about it, and I confessed that I had lied to her about not going.

Sarah was crushed and called me selfish for choosing to deceive her instead of having an honest conversation about our needs. I felt awful for hurting her, but at the same time, I was frustrated that she couldn’t see how much I needed a break. We both ended up arguing, bringing up past grievances, and it turned into a huge fight. 

In the end, I know I shouldn’t have lied, but I also feel like Sarah was a bit too harsh in how she handled my need for some time away. 

TL;DR: I lied to my girlfriend about going on a camping trip with friends to avoid a fight, but it blew up in my face when she found out and got really hurt.",231,1915,0.99,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_39939,2022-06-02 00:00:00,ESH,2025,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I (28F) recently attended my cousin's wedding, which was a big family event. It was a beautiful ceremony, and everyone was so excited to celebrate the couple. However, things got a bit messy during the reception.

Before the wedding, my cousin, the bride, had asked me to be her Maid of Honor. I was honored, but I was also going through a tough time personally—my long-term relationship had just ended, and I was still dealing with the emotional fallout. I tried my best to support her and be there for her in the lead-up to the wedding, but I wasn’t in the best headspace.

During the reception, there was a moment when the DJ played a song that reminded me of my ex. It hit me hard, and I ended up stepping outside to collect myself. I didn’t anticipate how long I’d be gone, but I needed a moment to breathe.

When I returned, I saw that my cousin had just started her speech—she looked for me to share some words of gratitude. She was visibly upset that I wasn’t there, and I could tell that it affected her. I felt bad, but I also thought she could understand given my situation. After the speech, she pulled me aside and told me how disappointed she was that I left during such an important moment. I tried to explain where I was coming from, but it didn’t seem to help.

Later, during a toast, I got a little carried away. I was trying to lighten the mood, so I shared a funny story about my ex to show that I was moving on. It didn’t land well. Some family members laughed, but I could see my cousin’s face fall. It was clear that it wasn’t the right time or place for my humor, and I regretted it as soon as I saw her reaction.

The rest of the evening was awkward. My cousin avoided me, and I felt terrible for ruining her day. I knew I should have been more considerate of her feelings and the significance of the moment. I also felt like I was justified in needing a moment for myself, but I probably should have handled it better. 

I reached out to her after the wedding to apologize, and she said she appreciated it but needed time to cool off. I can understand why she felt hurt.

Everyone sucks here,"I (30F) have a friend, Sarah (29F), who I've known since college. We’ve always been pretty close, but lately, I've noticed she’s been struggling with her mental health. She’s been more withdrawn and less responsive to texts and calls. I want to be there for her, but it’s hard to know how to help when she shuts me out.

One day, I decided to organize a small get-together at my place with a few of our mutual friends, hoping it would lift her spirits. I invited everyone, including Sarah, but I didn't mention it to her directly since she hadn’t been very communicative. I assumed she’d see the group chat and would want to come.

The day of the gathering, Sarah texted me, asking if I could talk. When we spoke, she sounded upset and mentioned that she saw the group chat and felt excluded since no one had reached out to her specifically. I explained my reasoning and said I thought a group setting might help her feel better. She accused me of not caring about her feelings and that I should have reached out directly instead of relying on the group chat. 

Feeling defensive, I told her that I was trying to help, and maybe she should make more of an effort to reach out if she wanted to feel included. This upset her even more, and she hung up on me. I felt bad for hurting her, but I also thought she was overreacting a bit.

Now, our mutual friends are caught in the middle. Some think I should have been more considerate, while others agree with my stance that she needs to take initiative in her friendships. I wish I had handled it better, but I feel frustrated that Sarah isn’t willing to meet me halfway. I just wanted to support her. 

So, AITA for trying to get our friends together to help Sarah when she didn’t reach out herself? Or is she being unreasonable for expecting me to cater to her when she’s been distant?",101,835,0.56,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_81338,2018-03-24 00:00:00,ESH,1833,AITA

We often hang out in a group with some mutual friends, and I’ve noticed that I’ve been feeling left out of the conversations. It seems like my friend has been making inside jokes and references that I just don’t get, and when I try to join in, I get brushed off.

Last week, I confronted my friend about it, saying I felt excluded and that I didn’t appreciate being sidelined during our hangouts. Instead of apologizing or acknowledging my feelings, they got defensive and accused me of being overly sensitive. This upset me even more, and I lashed out, calling them selfish for only thinking about their own enjoyment and not considering how it affected the group dynamic.

After that, our mutual friends started picking sides. Some agreed with me, saying they noticed the behavior too, while others sided with my friend, saying I was being too dramatic. Now our friend group feels divided, and I hate that I sparked this conflict, but I also feel hurt and frustrated.

So, AITA for calling out my friend for making me feel excluded, even though I reacted poorly?

Everyone sucks here,"Yesterday, I was at a coffee shop trying to get some work done. It was a packed Saturday morning, and I finally managed to find a small table in the corner. I set up my laptop and got settled in with my drink, ready to dive into my work.

As I was typing away, a group of four college students came in and sat at the table next to me. They were laughing and talking loudly, which was fine at first, but their chatter escalated quickly into rowdy banter. They were clearly having a good time, but their noise level was becoming a distraction. 

After about ten minutes of excruciatingly loud laughter, I decided to politely ask them to keep it down. I leaned over and said, ""Hey, hope you don’t mind, but could you keep it a bit quieter? I’m trying to work over here."" They looked at me for a moment, and then one of them responded, ""Chill out, it’s just a little fun!""

I felt a bit annoyed by their dismissive attitude, so I snapped back, ""It's a café, not a frat party. Some of us are trying to actually get something done."" Their laughter faded a bit, but then another one of the group said, “Wow, someone needs to lighten up!” 

At that point, I could feel myself getting more irritated. I muttered something under my breath about how some people have no respect for others, which they clearly overheard. They started whispering and giggling again, and I could tell I had become their topic of conversation.

Feeling frustrated, I packed my things and moved to another corner of the café. As I was leaving, I glanced back and saw them laughing again, probably at my expense. I could have ignored it, but I felt justified in standing up for myself.

Afterward, I shared the story with my friends, and they were split. Some said I was right to ask them to be quieter, while others thought I was being too uptight and should have just dealt with it. I can admit I got a bit snappy, but I also think they could have shown a little more respect.

Recently, one of my friends, Sarah (24F), started dating someone new, and she seems really happy, which is great. However, I’ve noticed that she often shares private details about our friend group with her new boyfriend, who I don’t know well. 

Last week, during a group hangout, Sarah mentioned something I confided in her about my family problems. I felt uncomfortable with this and told her that I wished she hadn’t shared that, especially since I was still figuring things out and didn’t want everyone to know. Sarah got defensive and said she was just sharing her life with her boyfriend, which I understand, but it still felt like a violation of trust. 

In the heat of the moment, I made a sarcastic comment about how she should probably just let him in on all our secrets if she thinks it’s no big deal. This made her upset, and she snapped back that I was being overly sensitive and should lighten up. 

After that, things escalated, and our other friends started taking sides. I felt like I was being ganged up on, and I ended up calling Sarah “fake” for pretending to be supportive while sharing my personal stuff. It turned into a whole argument, and now our friend group is divided.

He started yelling at me for breaking my promise, and I snapped back, saying he was overreacting and that I was old enough to make my own decisions.

Things escalated, and I ended up saying some hurtful things about how he needs to lighten up and how controlling he is. He shouted that I wouldn’t understand until I had my own responsibilities, and I told him he was just bitter about his life choices.

Everyone sucks here,"I’ve been friends with Sarah for a few years, and we’ve always had a great time hanging out. Recently, she started a small online business selling handmade jewelry. I thought it was awesome and supported her by sharing her posts and buying a few pieces.

A couple of weeks ago, I had a great idea for a new jewelry line that I thought would be a hit. I excitedly shared the concept with Sarah, hoping she’d be interested in collaborating. I explained how I envisioned the pieces and even sketched out a few designs. Sarah seemed enthusiastic at first, and we agreed to brainstorm further.

However, a few days later, I noticed that Sarah had posted a new collection that looked eerily similar to what I had shown her. The designs were almost identical, and she didn’t mention my contribution at all. When I confronted her about it, she claimed that she had come up with the idea independently and that my sketches had merely inspired her.

I was really hurt and frustrated because I felt like I was being taken advantage of. In retaliation, I decided to post on my social media about how I felt, calling out Sarah for what I saw as stealing my idea. I didn’t name her directly, but I made it clear that someone close to me had ripped off my designs. 

This caused a bit of drama, and while I was initially set on standing my ground, I later felt guilty about airing our issues publicly. Sarah ended up losing some followers and I received mixed feedback from my friends, with some supporting me and others calling me out for being petty.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I recently had a pretty tense situation with my roommate and a few mutual friends that I feel I need to get some perspective on.

We were all hanging out in our common area one evening, just chilling and watching a movie. My roommate, Alex, was really excited about this new show that had just dropped and kept mentioning how much he wanted to watch it. I had seen a few episodes already and thought it was alright, but I didn’t want to watch it again. So, I suggested we watch something else instead, which led to a bit of a back-and-forth.

Alex got increasingly frustrated, saying I was being a buzzkill and not considering what he wanted. At that point, I snapped and said something like, ""Maybe if you didn’t spend all your free time binging shows like a couch potato, you wouldn’t be so obsessed with this one!"" I didn’t think much of it at the time, but the mood in the room shifted pretty quickly.

Our other friends, Jamie and Ryan, were caught in the middle. Jamie tried to diffuse the situation by saying we could compromise and watch a different episode of the show, but I shot that down, feeling like I was being backed into a corner. Ryan then chimed in, saying, ""Wow, you really didn’t need to go that far, it’s just TV."" It felt like everyone was ganging up on me, which made me defensive, and I fired back at Ryan, saying he shouldn’t act like a saint when he binge-watches the same reality shows we all laugh about.

The tension escalated, and in the end, we just decided to call it a night. I don’t think I was entirely in the wrong for wanting to watch something different, but I also recognize that my comment to Alex was uncalled for and hurtful. At the same time, I felt like my friends weren't giving me a fair chance to express my opinion.

So, AITA for losing my cool over a show and saying something hurtful, while also feeling frustrated that my friends didn’t respect my input?

It was a rainy morning, and I was in a bit of a hurry to get to work, so I ordered my usual — a large coffee and a blueberry muffin. As I was waiting for my order, I noticed a sign on the counter that read, “Buy a large drink, get a pastry for half price!” I was excited, thinking I could get my muffin for a discount.

When I reached the counter to pay, I asked the barista about the sign and how I could apply the discount. She looked at me, a little annoyed, and said, “That deal ended last week.” I told her I didn’t see any new signage indicating that and pointed to the one still sitting there. She rolled her eyes and said, “Yeah, sorry, I haven’t had time to take that down yet.”

Feeling frustrated, I pressed on, saying, “Well, it’s misleading to have that still up. If I’d known it was over, I wouldn’t have ordered a muffin.” She snapped back, “It’s not my fault you didn’t read the dates!”

After a moment of awkward silence, I decided to take my muffin anyway, but I couldn’t help but remark, “You really should make sure your signs are accurate. It’s all about customer service.” She shot me a glare, and I could feel the tension rising. I paid for my coffee and muffin, but as I turned to leave, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was in the right.

I’ve been trying to help them get used to each other, but my partner tends to be a bit careless with how he manages Max around Luna.

However, it turned out that her party was on the same weekend as my sister’s wedding. I told Sarah about the conflict, and she seemed really disappointed but told me she understood.

I thought I was doing a good job, but I did overlook one important detail: I didn’t ask everyone about their food preferences or dietary restrictions.

After a few drinks, I ended up making a few sarcastic comments that were pretty cutting, aimed at Mike and Sarah about their engagement—nothing too extreme, but just enough to make people uncomfortable.

Mike called me out on it, asking if I was okay and why I was acting that way. Instead of responding calmly, I snapped back and said, “Well, not all of us are lucky enough to be getting married, Mike.” This created a tense atmosphere, and a few of our friends tried to lighten the mood, but I could tell I had ruined the vibe.

After that, I kind of stormed off to get some fresh air, and a couple of friends followed. They told me that I needed to apologize to Mike and Sarah for my comments. I felt bad, but I also thought they were being too sensitive. I ended up texting Mike later that night, apologizing for my behavior but also justifying that my feelings were valid because of my situation.

The next day, Mike replied saying he appreciated the apology but that I should think about how my words can affect others. I felt conflicted because while I acknowledged that I was insensitive, I also felt like they should understand where I was coming from.

So now I’m left wondering if I was the one in the wrong for my comments, or if they were being too sensitive given the context. Overall, I think we all could have handled things better that night.",411,728,0.98,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_30605,2018-10-22 00:00:00,ESH,2118,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I grew up in a household where my parents were very strict about manners and etiquette. They emphasized the importance of being polite and respectful, no matter the situation. I remember being chastised for raising my voice even in moments of excitement. As a result, I tend to be overly conscious about how I express myself and often go out of my way to avoid confrontation.

Now, I'm a parent to a 9-year-old girl, Zoe, who has a very different personality. She's bold, expressive, and often speaks her mind without a filter. While I admire her confidence, I also worry that she often pushes boundaries with her peers, especially during playdates. For example, she recently had a friend over, and I overheard her telling her friend that she didn’t want to play a game the friend suggested because it was ""boring."" She said this loudly and without any consideration for the friend's feelings, which made me cringe.

In an attempt to correct her behavior, I’ve been quite strict about teaching her manners. The other day, I gently told her that she could express her feelings, but she should do it politely. I also encouraged her to compromise and suggested that if she didn’t want to play a certain game, she should at least suggest alternatives respectfully.

However, I might have overdone it. When I asked her to apologize to her friend for being rude, she became upset and shouted at me that I was ""embarrassing"" her, and she didn’t want to play with me anymore. In that moment, I lost my cool and told her that I wasn't trying to embarrass her but to help her be a good friend. I raised my voice, which I usually don’t do, and I could see her retreating into her shell.

Looking back, I realize I could have approached the situation with more empathy and patience. Instead of trying to impose my values, I could have guided her in a way that didn’t make her feel attacked or belittled. At the same time, Zoe needs to learn that being honest doesn't mean being hurtful.

So, AITA for being too strict with my daughter in trying to teach her manners, or is she the one in the wrong for being disrespectful to her friend and then taking it out on me? I feel like we both messed up in different ways.",986,2562,0.58,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_98395,2023-03-06 00:00:00,ESH,2202,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I’m 30, and I have a sister, Sarah, who is 28. Growing up, we had a pretty typical sibling relationship—argued a lot but generally supportive of each other. However, a few years ago, Sarah went through a tough time after her breakup and ended up moving in with me to get back on her feet.

Initially, it was fine. I helped her find a job and was there for her emotionally. But over time, she started to take advantage of my kindness. She would leave her mess everywhere, never contributed to groceries, and expected me to be her emotional support 24/7. I felt like I was losing my space and independence.

One night, we got into a big argument. I had a long day at work and was exhausted. I asked her to clean up after herself because I was tired of living in a chaotic environment. She exploded, saying I was being selfish and that I was supposed to be helping her through her difficult time. I snapped back that I was tired of being her caretaker when she was perfectly capable of taking care of herself.

In the heat of the moment, I told her that if she couldn’t respect my home, she needed to find somewhere else to live. I felt terrible afterward and tried to apologize, but she wouldn’t hear it. She ended up moving out abruptly, and now there’s a rift between us.

It’s been a few weeks, and I’ve heard from our parents that she’s been crying and saying I betrayed her. I feel conflicted because I do think I had a right to set boundaries, but I also feel bad for how I said it and how much it hurt her.

A few months ago, my roommate and I got into a heated argument about chores. I felt like I was doing way more than my share, and he just didn’t care. In a moment of frustration, I told him that I was tired of being the only responsible one and that he needed to get his act together. It was a bit harsh, but I was fed up.

Fast forward to last week, our mutual friend invited us both to a party. I figured it would be a good way to cool off and reconnect. However, during the party, I noticed my roommate flirting with a girl I had a crush on for a while. I felt really hurt and betrayed, especially since he knew I liked her. I ended up getting a bit drunk and confronted him about it in front of everyone, saying it was low of him to go after someone I liked. He got angry with me, saying I was being childish and that he could like whoever he wanted.

The whole thing turned into a public argument, and it felt like we both made fools of ourselves. In the aftermath, I apologized to him, acknowledging that I shouldn’t have confronted him like that in front of everyone. He accepted my apology but told me that the trust was broken. 

Now, I feel like I was justified in my feelings, but I also regret the way I handled the situation. It's uncomfortable living together now, and I'm not sure how to move forward.

Everyone sucks here,"I need to share this because it's been weighing on me a lot lately. I (27F) have a group of close friends I’ve known since college, and we often do game nights at each other's places. Recently, we decided to rotate who hosts, and it was my turn.

I wanted to make the night special, so I planned an elaborate dinner to go along with our games. I spent a lot of time and effort preparing everything, making sure the food was delicious and the atmosphere was great. I even created a fun little trivia game that matched the theme of the night.

When my friends arrived, they were impressed with the setup and the food, and we all started off in high spirits. However, as the night went on, one of my friends, Mark (30M), started making jokes at my expense. At first, I thought he was just playing around, but the jokes became increasingly personal. He poked fun at my cooking skills, saying things like, “Are you sure you didn’t poison us with this?” and “I didn’t know we were having a competition for the worst dinner.”

I was already feeling a bit insecure about my cooking because I had put so much effort into it, and his comments began to hurt. Instead of addressing it directly, I made a sarcastic comment back about his inability to cook at all and how he should stick to takeout. This escalated the situation, and soon everyone was laughing awkwardly, but I felt like Mark wasn’t taking my feelings seriously.

After the dinner ended, Mark confronted me about my comment, saying I overreacted and made things uncomfortable. I was upset and told him that he needed to understand how hurtful his jokes were and that I didn’t appreciate him making me the butt of the joke in front of everyone. He insisted that I was being too sensitive and that it was all in good fun.

Now, I feel guilty for snapping back at him and causing tension within our friend group. But I also feel like Mark crossed a line with his jokes. It’s been a week since the dinner, and the atmosphere feels off among us.

Recently, he decided to take a two-week trip to Europe and asked if I could take care of his dog, Max, while he was gone. Since I love dogs and have the time, I agreed without thinking too much about it.

During the time I was taking care of Max, I noticed he was starting to run low on food. Jake didn’t leave me any money for dog supplies, and I didn’t want to bother him while he was enjoying his trip. So, I decided to buy a bag of dog food with my own money. I figured it wasn’t a big deal since I was already taking care of Max and wanted to make sure he was well-fed.

When Jake returned, I told him about the dog food purchase, expecting him to be grateful. Instead, he got upset and said I should have just called him first instead of spending my own money. He felt like I overstepped, and that he would have sent money if I’d asked. I understand where he’s coming from, but I felt frustrated because I was just trying to help out.

On my side, I also felt a bit taken for granted. I was doing him a favor by taking care of his dog, and I thought buying food was a reasonable thing to do. So, yeah, I guess I could have communicated better with him, but I also think he could have appreciated my effort more.

A few weeks ago, I noticed that our living room had become cluttered with his gaming equipment—controllers, snacks, and energy drink cans were strewn everywhere. I asked him if he could tidy up his things, but he brushed it off, saying he would get to it later. It kept piling up, and I found it increasingly frustrating to navigate through the mess.

One day, after a particularly long work week, I lost my temper. I yelled at him about how messy the place had become and how I felt like I was constantly picking up after him. He responded defensively, saying he was stressed from work too and gaming was his way to unwind. He pointed out that I often leave my shoes and bags scattered around the apartment, which is true. I realized I hadn't been as tidy as I could be either.

In the heat of the moment, I suggested that he should just take his gaming stuff to his parents' house if he couldn't keep it organized here. This hurt him, and he spent the rest of the evening sulking. I later apologized for my harsh words, but we still haven't really resolved the underlying issue of our messy living space or how we both contribute to it.

Despite her dismissive attitude, I tried to remain supportive. However, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I needed to protect her.

So, I (28F) have a bit of a complicated relationship with my cousin (30F). We grew up together and were pretty close until our late teens when we started drifting apart. The main issue is that she has always been very competitive and often belittles my accomplishments. For example, when I graduated from college, she made a snide remark about how it was ""just a degree"" and that she was doing better in life because she was getting married and starting a family.

Fast forward to now, she’s getting married in a few months and sent out her invitations. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to go because I’m still feeling hurt from the comments she’s made over the years, but I figured family is family, and I should be supportive.

However, a few days ago, I found out that she had been talking behind my back to other family members about how ""pathetic"" my single life is and how I ""should have settled down by now."" This really upset me because I’ve been working hard on my career and personal growth, and it felt like she was trying to undermine me again.

When I confronted her about it, she brushed it off and told me I was being too sensitive and that I should be happy for her instead of being jealous. I snapped and told her that I wouldn’t be attending her wedding after all, and I didn’t want to be part of her toxic environment.

Now my family is split. Some of them think I’m in the right for standing up for myself, while others feel I’m being petty and should just suck it up for the sake of family.

However, there's this one teacher, Mr. Thompson, who has been a bit of a jerk. He's pretty condescending and often talks down to the janitorial staff, like we're not worth his time.

I told him that I had just mopped and that the floors needed some time to dry, but he just kept going on about how ""useless"" the janitors are. It really rubbed me the wrong way, and I was tired of his attitude.

So, in a moment of frustration, I decided to get back at him. The next day, I went in extra early and made sure to leave his classroom a mess. I knocked over some papers, left the garbage can overflowing, and even spilled a little water on the floor, knowing he’d have to step around it.

Everyone sucks here,"So I have a friend, let's call her Sarah, who has been struggling with her mental health for a while. I've always tried to be supportive and check in on her, but I also have my own issues to deal with, and sometimes I just need my space.

Recently, Sarah reached out to me, asking if I could come over and help her with a project she was working on. I agreed because I wanted to be there for her, but when I arrived, it quickly became clear that she was in a really dark place. Instead of working on her project, she wanted to talk about her feelings and how overwhelmed she felt. I tried to listen, but after an hour of the same conversation, I started to feel frustrated. I told her that I cared about her but that I needed her to also focus on her own progress and not just dwell on the negatives.

Sarah got upset and said that I was being insensitive and that I didn't understand what she was going through. I felt bad because I truly want to help her, but I also felt like I wasn't a therapist and that I couldn’t carry her emotional burdens all the time. In the heat of the moment, I suggested she consider talking to a professional instead of leaning on me so much.

Now, she’s really upset with me and our friendship feels strained. I’ve been thinking maybe I shouldn’t have said that, but at the same time, I felt overwhelmed trying to support her without setting any boundaries. 

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for telling my friend to seek professional help instead of relying on me?",123,1028,0.55,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_14115,2023-01-08 00:00:00,ESH,1494,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Okay, so a week ago, I went to a local park with my dog to enjoy the nice weather. It was a sunny day, and the park was pretty busy. I found a nice spot under a tree and set up my blanket, letting my dog roam a bit while keeping an eye on him.

After a while, a family came over and set up their picnic right next to me. There were three kids, and they seemed excited to have a picnic. I was trying to enjoy my time and not disturb them, but my dog got curious and walked over to them. One of the kids started to pet him, which was fine, but then the other two kids started to get a bit rowdy, running around and squealing.

I called my dog back to me, but he was still interested in the kids. I got up and started to walk him away a little bit, but the kids were now chasing him, thinking it was a game. I told them to stop because my dog can get anxious, but they kept coming closer, laughing and trying to grab him.

At that point, I got frustrated and raised my voice, telling them to back off and leave my dog alone. The parents, who were sitting nearby, overheard and came over. They immediately started to scold me, saying I was being too harsh on their kids and that they were just trying to have fun. I explained that my dog was not comfortable with that kind of interaction, but they continued to argue with me, saying I should just let the kids play.

Eventually, I ended up yelling at the parents, saying they should control their kids better, and they retorted that I shouldn’t have brought a dog to a family park if I didn’t want kids to play with him. It turned into a bit of a scene, and people around started to look.

We both ended up leaving the area, and I felt really bad about how it escalated, but I was also upset that they didn’t respect my boundaries.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I (30M) have a close friend, Jess (29F), who recently lost her job and has been struggling financially. She asked if she could stay with me for a while until she gets back on her feet. I agreed and told her to take her time, as I genuinely wanted to help her.

However, after a few weeks, I started to feel overwhelmed. My apartment isn’t very big, and I felt like my space was cramped. Jess is a good friend, but she has a habit of leaving the kitchen a mess after cooking, and she often stays up late playing video games, which disrupts my sleep schedule. I tried to talk to her about it a couple of times, but she brushed it off and said she was just trying to relax after a stressful time.

One night, I had a really rough day at work, and when I got home, the kitchen was a disaster. I lost my temper and yelled at her for not respecting my space. I told her she needed to start cleaning up after herself and that this living situation wasn't working for me. Jess got really upset and started crying, saying she thought I was a supportive friend and that I was making her feel worse about her situation.

In the heat of the moment, I told her that if she couldn’t respect my home, she should find somewhere else to stay. After realizing how harsh I had been, I felt terrible and tried to apologize, but she was already packing her things and left. Now, I feel awful for kicking her out when she was already struggling, but I also feel justified for wanting to maintain my living environment.

Everyone sucks here,"My best friend and I have been inseparable since childhood, but recently things have gotten a bit tense. We both started dating girls around the same time, and while I was really happy for him, I found myself feeling a little left out. His girlfriend is great, but she can be a bit controlling and doesn't seem to like me hanging out with him without her.

Last week, we made plans to go to a concert together, just like we used to. But the night before, my friend texted me saying his girlfriend didn’t want him to go unless she could come too. I was frustrated because I felt like I was losing my best friend to this new relationship. I replied, somewhat jokingly, that maybe he should just break up with her if she didn’t trust him to spend time with his friends. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but he took it really seriously and got upset.

The next day, we went to the concert together, and the atmosphere was awkward. At one point, while we were waiting in line for drinks, I casually mentioned that his girlfriend acts like she owns him. He laughed it off, but I could tell he was bothered. When we got home, he confronted me about my comments, saying I was being disrespectful to his girlfriend and that I was jealous of their relationship. I snapped back that he was being a pushover and letting her dictate how he spends his time.

Now, he has told me that he needs some space and feels like I'm not supporting him in his relationship. I feel like I was just trying to express my feelings about the situation, but maybe I was too harsh. I’ve reached out to him to apologize, but he hasn’t responded yet. I don’t want to lose my best friend, but I also feel like he’s not standing up for himself and he should be able to have a life outside of his relationship.

Looking back, I realize that I could’ve handled my frustrations better and maybe been more supportive. But I also think he should be able to maintain friendships without feeling guilty about it.

Everyone sucks here,"Me (30M) and my girlfriend (29F) have been dating for about two years. We both love to cook and often enjoy trying out new recipes together. Last weekend, we decided to host a dinner party for some friends and thought it would be a great opportunity to showcase our cooking skills.

I had a recipe in mind for a complicated dish that required a lot of prep work, and I asked my girlfriend if we could focus on that dish for the night. She agreed, but as the day went on, she got super excited about making a dessert that was not part of our original plan. I suggested that we stick to the main dish since it was a bit ambitious and we didn’t have a lot of time, but she insisted she could handle both.

Fast forward to the evening. I was in the kitchen working on the main dish when I noticed she was having trouble with the dessert. I tried to help, but she was resistant and wanted to do it her way. I got frustrated, and during a particularly tense moment, I snapped at her, saying she was making a mess and that she should just focus on the main meal since that was what we agreed on.

Things escalated, and we ended up arguing in front of our friends. I felt bad for raising my voice, but I also thought she was being unreasonable for not listening to me. Our friends tried to diffuse the situation, but it ended up ruining the vibe of the evening.

After everyone left, we had a long talk. She was upset that I didn’t support her in making the dessert and said I could’ve been more patient. I told her that she needed to respect my wishes and the plan we had set. Both of us said things we regretted and we’ve been a bit distant since.

Now I’m left wondering if I was the asshole for yelling at her in front of our friends or if she was being unreasonable by not sticking to our plan.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I (28F) have a close group of friends, and we often hang out together. We have a game night tradition, and everyone loves it. Recently, we decided to have a themed night where everyone had to dress up as their favorite video game characters. I was really excited and put a lot of effort into my costume, going as a character from a popular RPG.

The night of the event, I arrived early to help set things up. My friend Jake (29M), who is known for being a bit of a jokester, showed up dressed as a generic character he threw together last minute. I asked him if he was going to take it more seriously, and he laughed it off, saying he just wanted to have fun and didn’t want to put in too much effort.

As the night went on, I noticed that despite my hard work on my costume, Jake kept making little sarcastic jokes about how ""serious"" everyone was being with their costumes. At first, I tried to brush it off because I know he just has that kind of humor, but it really started to get to me. Eventually, I snapped and told him that if he didn’t care about the theme, he should just sit out. I didn't mean to escalate things, but I was frustrated. 

Jake got defensive and said I was being too uptight and that he was just trying to have fun. This led to a heated argument where we both said some things we regretted. I told him that it felt like he was mocking everyone else's efforts, and he accused me of being a killjoy who couldn’t take a joke.

Later in the night, we both tried to apologize, but the tension lingered. I felt bad for how I reacted, and I know I shouldn't have let his jokes get under my skin. But I also think he should have been more respectful of the effort everyone else put in.

He got really upset and called me a jerk for being passive-aggressive. I felt justified because I had asked him nicely multiple times to take care of his stuff, but maybe I should have just had a direct conversation instead of dumping the dishes in his space.

Last weekend, we were at a family gathering, and she started going on about how she was planning to throw a big birthday party for herself. She mentioned how she wanted it to be a “surprise” party, but she was also planning every little detail herself, making it clear that she expected everyone to pitch in without her actually asking for help. I tried to be supportive, but I also pointed out that throwing a surprise party for yourself seemed a bit contradictory, and that she might want to consider just having a normal celebration instead.

She took my comment really harshly and started crying, saying I was ruining her excitement and that I was always trying to control things. I, feeling frustrated, said something like, “It’s not my fault you can’t handle a little constructive criticism.” That escalated into a full argument, and we ended up yelling at each other in front of the family. My parents were visibly uncomfortable, and I felt bad for putting them in that position.

After the argument, she didn’t talk to me for the rest of the day, and I felt guilty. I know I could have been more tactful, but at the same time, I was annoyed with her for always making things so dramatic and being overly sensitive. I feel like we both handled the situation poorly.

Everyone sucks here,"I've always been a big believer in honesty, especially when it comes to communicating with friends and family. Growing up, my parents were very straightforward and encouraged me to do the same, which I appreciate. However, there's a fine line between honesty and being hurtful, and I seem to have crossed it lately.

Recently, my best friend, Sarah, organized a surprise birthday party for her husband. She had put a lot of effort into planning it, and I could tell she was really excited. When I arrived, I noticed that the decorations were a little tacky, and the cake didn't look very appetizing. Instead of keeping my thoughts to myself, I casually mentioned to Sarah that I wasn't a fan of the decorations and that the cake seemed like it came from a grocery store.

Sarah's face dropped. I didn't think I was being that harsh; I was just being honest. But she looked genuinely hurt. I tried to reassure her that I thought her effort was great overall, but she seemed to take my comments to heart. A few days later, she confronted me about my comments, saying that I had ruined the party for her and made her feel bad about something she worked hard on.

In my mind, I was just being a good friend by sharing my thoughts, but I realized that maybe I should have kept my opinions on the decorations and cake to myself. But at the same time, I also felt like she should be able to take criticism, especially if I meant it in a constructive way.

To complicate matters, I later vented about the situation to another friend who, instead of helping me see my mistake, agreed that Sarah should have been more open to feedback. Now, I feel like I've let down both Sarah and my other friend by not being the supportive person they need in their lives.

During the trip, we were sitting around the campfire, and after a few drinks, Emily started making fun of my love for a certain band that I’ve loved since high school. I tried to laugh it off at first, but she kept pushing. Then, she brought up an embarrassing story from my past, which I had confided in Jake about years ago. She told it in an exaggerated, ridiculous way for everyone to hear, and I felt really humiliated.

In the moment, I got defensive and called her out for being insensitive and rude. I pointed out that she has her own embarrassing moments and that she should be more mindful about joking at others' expense. The group went quiet, and Jake looked really uncomfortable. Emily got upset and accused me of ruining the fun and being overly sensitive.

Afterward, Jake pulled me aside and said I shouldn't have escalated the situation like that, especially in front of everyone.

So, I (28F) work in a small office with a team of five people, including my coworker Jake (30M). We’ve been working together for about a year, and while we get along well enough, there’s been an ongoing issue with Jake consistently being late to work and meetings. Most days, he arrives at least 30 minutes late, and he always has an excuse, whether it’s traffic, kids, or something else. 

At first, I thought it was just a phase and tried to be understanding. However, as time went on, it started affecting our team’s productivity. Meetings would have to be delayed, and I often ended up having to cover for him when his tardiness impacted deadlines. The rest of the team has started to express their frustration, and it’s creating tension in the office. 

I decided to bring it up with Jake directly. I approached him after work one day and asked if he could try to be on time more often. I explained how it was affecting the team and that we all relied on each other to be present and accountable. Instead of taking it well, he got defensive, saying I was overreacting and that he had a lot going on in his life. 

I felt frustrated by his response and raised my voice, telling him that he needed to take responsibility for his job and stop making excuses. I didn’t yell, but I was harsh and emotional. He walked away from the conversation visibly upset, and I later overheard him talking to another coworker about how I had no right to confront him like that.

Now I feel bad about how I handled it and realize I might have come off as too aggressive. At the same time, I genuinely believe he needs to take this issue seriously.

Last week, I came home to find out he had taken my expensive headphones and kind of ruined them while playing around with them. I was furious because they were a gift from my dad, and I've been saving up for a new pair. When I confronted him, he just shrugged it off and said it was no big deal.

I felt her pieces were more about getting attention than genuinely wanting feedback.

One of the new people there was Sarah (26F), and she immediately struck me as someone who loved to be the center of attention. Throughout the night, she made several jokes at the expense of others, including some pretty harsh comments about a mutual friend's job and another friend's outfit.

At one point, she turned her attention to me and started commenting on my style, saying things like, ""It's so cute that you think that shirt is trendy."" I tried to laugh it off, but honestly, it made me uncomfortable. Instead of just letting it go, I decided to respond in a way that was definitely not my best moment. I said something like, ""Well, at least I’m not trying too hard to get attention like you are."" 

The mood shifted, and Sarah looked taken aback. She fired back, calling me insecure and suggesting that maybe I should focus on my own wardrobe choices instead of judging hers. The friends around us were caught in the middle, and the tension was palpable. 

Afterward, a couple of our friends pulled me aside and told me I shouldn't have reacted that way, but they also pointed out that Sarah's comments were unnecessary and hurtful. Looking back, I realize we both crossed lines. I shouldn’t have stooped to her level, and she definitely shouldn’t have made those initial jabs at me or anyone else.

Everyone sucks here,"Using a throwaway for privacy. So, I recently had a falling out with my best friend, Jessica, over something that happened at a mutual friend's birthday party. We’ve been close for years, and I really value our friendship. 

The party was at a bar, and I knew it would be pretty rowdy. Jessica and I arrived together, but it quickly got packed, and it was hard to keep track of everyone. I went to the bathroom and when I came back, I found Jessica sitting at a table with a group of guys, laughing and drinking.

Now, I know Jessica has a tendency to get a bit flirty when she drinks. I’m not one to judge; we all have our fun, but I was a bit concerned since one of the guys was someone she had previously dated and had a messy breakup with. I approached the table and jokingly said, “Hey Jess, save some of that charm for your friends!” I thought it would be light-hearted, but she shot me a look and told me to relax.

As the night went on, I noticed she was getting more and more comfortable with the guys, especially the one from her past. I felt uncomfortable and decided to intervene again. I told her that we should stick together since we came to the party as a team. She got annoyed and said I was being a buzzkill and that she was just having fun. I insisted that she should be careful and not lose track of herself. 

At that point, she snapped at me and told me to stop acting like her parent. I felt hurt and defensive, so I said something like, “Maybe if you were a better friend, you’d understand I’m just looking out for you!” This caused a scene, and Jessica ended up storming off to the bathroom. 

When she came back, she avoided me for the rest of the night, and I felt guilty for escalating things. However, I also felt justified in wanting to protect her from potentially bad decisions. After the party, we had a huge falling out where we both said things we didn’t mean. I told her she was being reckless, and she told me I was controlling. 

I really miss my friend, and I keep wondering if either of us was in the wrong here. Was I too overbearing, or was she ignoring good advice? I just wish we could get back to how things were before.",195,1049,0.89,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_84849,2019-03-01 00:00:00,ESH,2165,AITA

She confided in me that she often feels overwhelmed and has been in therapy, which I fully support. Recently, I moved into a new apartment and invited a few friends over for a housewarming party. I wanted to create a fun atmosphere, so I planned some games and prepared snacks.

When Sarah arrived, she seemed off. Instead of joining in the fun, she sat quietly on the couch and hardly spoke to anyone. I tried to include her, but she just shrugged it off and said she wasn't feeling up to it. After a while, I noticed that she was scrolling on her phone, and it seemed like she was looking at social media.

In a moment of frustration, I jokingly said, ""Hey Sarah, if you're going to sit there on your phone, you might as well just go home."" It came out more bluntly than I intended, and I immediately regretted it. Sarah looked hurt, and she left the party soon after. 

The next day she texted me, saying that my comment made her feel worse about herself and that she wished I'd been more understanding of her situation. I felt bad, but I also felt that she was being a bit overly sensitive. I mean, I was trying to have a good time and it was just a joke. 

I ended up responding that she had a responsibility to engage if she came to the party and that she shouldn't take everything so seriously.

Everyone sucks here,"Throwaway account because my friends know my main.

I’ve been friends with Sarah for years, and we usually get along really well. We both love to travel, and we often plan trips together. Recently, we organized a weekend getaway to a cabin in the woods with a group of friends. We agreed to split the costs, and everything was set.

A week before the trip, Sarah confided in me that she was feeling stressed about finances and wasn’t sure she could afford her share anymore. I understood that times were tough for her, so I offered to cover her part this time, thinking I could help out a friend in need. I said, “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it. Just pay me back when you can.” She seemed relieved and grateful, which made me feel good about my decision.

However, once we arrived at the cabin, Sarah started posting pictures on social media, showcasing her new designer outfit and expensive accessories she’d bought specifically for the trip. I felt a bit taken aback, thinking if she could afford that, why couldn’t she chip in for the cabin? I didn’t say anything at the time, but it started to eat away at me.

Later that evening, while we were all sitting around the fire, I jokingly brought it up. I said, “You know, it’s funny how you’re rocking that designer look while I’m covering your share of the cabin.” I thought it would get a laugh, but Sarah got really defensive. She said I was being rude and that she had saved for the outfit as a way to treat herself after a tough period. I didn’t mean for it to come off as hurtful, but I felt frustrated that I was helping her out while she seemed to be flaunting money on unnecessary things.

The rest of the night was tense. We ended up arguing about it, and I ended up saying some things I shouldn’t have about her spending habits. She called me selfish for bringing it up and said I was ruining the trip for everyone. I felt bad for what I said, but I also thought it was unfair for her to expect me to keep quiet about it.

We both ended up apologizing the next day, but the atmosphere was still awkward for the rest of the trip. I guess we both contributed to the mess. So, AITA for bringing up her spending when I was trying to help her out?",514,2436,0.83,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_73662,2020-09-11 00:00:00,ESH,2207,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I (30F) recently had a disagreement with my friend Jake (28M) over a joint project we were working on for a local charity event. We were tasked with organizing a fundraising dinner, and while I took the lead on most of the planning, Jake volunteered to handle the marketing and outreach.

From the start, Jake seemed more focused on making the event fun for himself and his friends rather than prioritizing the charity’s needs. He wanted to create a flashy social media campaign, complete with memes and jokes, instead of highlighting the cause we were supporting. I voiced my concerns about how we should keep the focus on the charity, but he brushed me off, insisting that people would only come if we made it entertaining.

As the event date approached, Jake started inviting a lot of his friends from outside the charity circle. I was uncomfortable with this because I felt like it could dilute the purpose of the event. I tried to talk to him about it, but he dismissed my worries again, claiming I was being too serious. I got really frustrated and, in a moment of anger, I decided to send a group message to all our contacts, emphasizing the importance of the charity and the actual cause behind the event, which inadvertently called out Jake’s approach.

Jake was furious when he saw the message. He accused me of undermining him and ruining the fun. I felt justified in wanting to keep the focus on the charity, but I also recognized that I had overstepped by sending that message without discussing it with him first. In the end, the event was pretty successful, but the tension between us lingered.

I’ve been reflecting on it and I realize we both contributed to the situation — Jake for not taking the project seriously and me for handling my frustrations in a passive-aggressive way.

Everyone sucks here,"I need to provide some context for this situation. I’m a 29-year-old woman, and my brother is 31. We both have our own lives, but we are close enough to maintain a good sibling relationship. My brother has two kids, a 6-year-old boy and a 4-year-old girl. 

Last weekend, we had a family barbecue at our parents' house. It was a nice afternoon, and everyone was in good spirits. However, my brother has a habit of boasting about his kids, which he usually does in front of the family. He often compares them to each other and to my own achievements, which can feel a bit uncomfortable.

During this barbecue, my brother started bragging about how advanced his son is for his age. He mentioned how his son is already reading at a second-grade level and is excelling in his preschool. While I acknowledge that his son is bright, I felt it was unnecessary to compare him to my achievements when I was younger, especially since I never had kids of my own.

So, in an attempt to lighten the mood and maybe gently deflate my brother’s ego, I jokingly said, ""Well, at least your son can read; my dog can barely fetch!"" It was meant as a playful jab, but my brother didn’t take it well. He snapped back, saying I was bitter because I don’t have kids of my own and that my life isn’t as fulfilling. 

Things escalated quickly, with both of us exchanging barbs about our life choices. I didn’t mean to hit a nerve, but I felt like he was constantly trying to one-up everyone with his kids’ achievements.

She recently decided to quit her stable job to pursue her dream of becoming a full-time artist. While I admire her passion, I can’t help but worry about her financial stability, especially since she lives in a big city with a high cost of living.

Recently, Liz asked if she could move in with me for a few months while she gets her art career off the ground. I agreed, thinking it would be good for her and that I could help her out. But I also set some ground rules. One of those rules was that she needed to contribute to the household in some way, whether that was helping with chores or paying a small amount of rent. I didn’t think this was unreasonable, given that she’s an adult and I work hard to pay my bills.

At first, things went smoothly. She kept to herself and focused on her artwork, but then things started to change. Liz began inviting friends over at all hours, often without telling me ahead of time. I’d come home from work to find a group of people hanging out in my living room, sometimes with loud music playing. I brought it up to her, expressing that I needed some notice before she has company and that I also need my space to unwind after work. She shrugged it off, saying I could just join them if I wanted. 

Things escalated when I found out that Liz had posted some pictures of my apartment on her social media account without asking me. The pictures weren’t just of her artwork; they included our living space, and I felt uncomfortable with that. I told her I didn’t want our home being shared with her followers, many of whom I didn’t know. Liz got defensive and accused me of being controlling, claiming that I should be more supportive of her art and her lifestyle choices.

In the heat of the moment, I snapped back, saying that if she wanted to live like a carefree artist, she could do it on her own and not under my roof. She was hurt and said I was unsupportive. Now there's a rift between us, and I feel bad for how I reacted, but I also think I had a right to protect my space and set boundaries.

Everyone sucks here,"So here's the situation: My boyfriend (26M) and I (25F) have been together for about two years. We get along really well, but we definitely have our differences. One of the biggest ones is that he’s super into sports, especially football, while I couldn’t care less about it. I find it boring and honestly, I just don’t get the appeal.

A few weeks ago, he invited me to a football game with his friends. I hesitated at first, but he really wanted me to come, so I agreed. I figured it’d be fun to hang out with him and his friends, even if I wasn’t excited about the game itself.

The day of the game came, and I tried to be supportive. I wore his team’s colors and even made some snacks for us to take. But as soon as we got there, he was glued to the game and barely included me in any conversation. I felt really left out, like I was just an accessory to the event. I tried to engage with his friends, but they were all so focused on the game that they didn’t pay much attention to me either.

At halftime, I was feeling frustrated and a bit neglected. I decided to step away and grab a drink. When I came back, I overheard him telling his friends how he couldn’t believe I wasn't into football and how it was “such a turn-off” for him. I felt hurt by that comment and, honestly, it felt like a slap in the face after trying to be supportive and make an effort.

In the heat of the moment, I decided to make a snide remark about how “maybe he should find someone who cares more about sports.” This led to a heated argument in front of his friends, and we ended up leaving early. He was upset that I had embarrassed him in front of them, and I was upset that he made me feel so unimportant.

Now, after cooling off, I feel bad about how I reacted. I could have just let it go instead of being passive-aggressive. But I also think he was kind of an asshole for talking down about my lack of interest in football when I was trying to support him.

During this time, I developed a closer bond with her, and I genuinely wanted to help her heal.

I told her that I cared for her deeply and wanted to be more than just friends. I thought she might feel the same, but instead, she reacted poorly. She said she needed time and space and felt overwhelmed because she was still processing her breakup.

I felt awful for bringing it up while she was so vulnerable. It created an awkward tension between us, and she started to pull away. I tried to give her the space she needed, but I also couldn't help but feel rejected and hurt.

Eventually, she stormed off, and I felt bad for escalating things, but I also thought she could have been more grateful for me trying to make the best of the situation. The rest of the guests awkwardly tried to change the topic, and it was just uncomfortable. Later in the night, I approached her and said I was sorry for how I reacted, but I felt like she could have done more for her own birthday. She just said she was tired of me always pushing my opinions on her.

Last week, I had a huge argument with my roommate, Jake. We’ve been living together for over a year now, and while we usually get along, things have been tense lately. I started a new job and have been working long hours, which has made me cranky and less tolerant of things.

Jake has a habit of inviting friends over without asking me first, and they can be really loud, especially when I’m exhausted and trying to unwind. Last weekend, he had a bunch of friends over for a party, and I snapped. I yelled at him to be more considerate and just kicked everyone out.

Jake was furious, and I ended up saying some hurtful things about how I didn't want to live with someone who couldn't respect my space. He retaliated by calling me a control freak and said I was being dramatic. We ended up not talking for a couple of days, and now the atmosphere in our apartment is super awkward.

I feel like I overreacted, but part of me thinks he should’ve known better than to throw a party when I’ve been stressed. So, AITA for blowing up at him?",684,2018,0.53,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_66105,2022-04-05 00:00:00,ESH,1077,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I’ll try to keep this brief. 

My best friend, Sarah, and I have been inseparable since high school. We’ve always supported each other through thick and thin. Recently, Sarah got engaged and asked me to be her maid of honor, which I was thrilled about. However, I could tell she was stressed about planning the wedding, and I wanted to be as helpful as possible.

A couple of months later, I got into a bit of a bind. I had been planning a surprise birthday party for my husband, and when I told Sarah about it, she mentioned that she was also planning a bridal shower for herself around the same time. I offered to help her with it, thinking it would lighten her load. But as the party date approached, I realized I’d overcommitted.

The weekend of the party and bridal shower came, and I completely lost track of time. The day before my husband’s birthday, I was working on decorations for his surprise party while trying to help Sarah finalize her bridal shower details. I ended up working late into the night and didn’t get enough sleep. The next day, I was running around to get everything ready for my husband while also trying to remember what Sarah needed for her event.

On the day of the birthday party, I was exhausted and a bit frazzled. A couple of hours into the party, I got a text from Sarah asking where I was. I had totally forgotten to attend her bridal shower, which was happening at the same time. I felt horrible when I realized I had let her down and missed such an important event for her. I quickly sent her a message apologizing, but she was understandably upset. She felt betrayed that I chose my husband's party over her bridal shower, and she confronted me about it.

In my defense, I told her that I had been overwhelmed and didn’t mean to prioritize one event over the other. But instead of just apologizing, I got defensive. I started saying that she needed to understand how stressful planning a surprise party can be, too, and that she was being unreasonable. We ended up arguing, and I ended up saying some hurtful things about her being too demanding.

Ever since that day, things have been tense. Sarah doesn’t want to talk to me, and our mutual friends also think I was out of line for not prioritizing her shower. I feel bad for missing it, and I know I should have managed my time better, but I also think Sarah didn’t consider my situation either. Now I’m left feeling like I lost my best friend over this.

So, AITA for missing my best friend’s bridal shower because I was too stressed with my husband’s surprise party, and for getting defensive when she called me out on it?",784,2618,0.59,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_88311,2024-01-29 00:00:00,ESH,2617,AITA

I work a 9-to-5 job and usually go to bed around 10 PM. Alex, on the other hand, is a night owl. He often stays up until the early hours of the morning playing video games and chatting with friends online. I’ve tried to be understanding about it since I know that gaming is a big passion for him, but the volume is just too much. I can hear every word he shouts and the sound effects from the game. It’s frustrating when I’m trying to sleep.

I brought it up to him a couple of times, asking if he could wear headphones or at least lower the volume after 10 PM. He said he would try, but honestly, it hasn’t changed much. Last week, I finally snapped after a particularly rough day at work. I went into the living room and told him he was being inconsiderate and that his gaming was ruining my sleep. We ended up having a heated argument where I raised my voice, and he fired back, saying I was being uptight and needed to chill out.

It escalated to the point where we both said things we regretted. I felt bad afterward, but he also didn’t seem to take my concerns seriously. Now there's this awkward tension between us.

My friend Mark has a habit of making everything about himself, and it's starting to really annoy me. A few weeks ago, I hosted a small gathering at my place to celebrate my new job. I invited a few close friends, and we were all excited to hang out. I made food, set up some games, and even bought a nice cake.

Mark showed up late, as usual, and immediately took center stage. He started talking about his recent dating life, which, let’s be honest, is always a bit of a train wreck, but he seems to think it’s the most interesting thing in the world. The vibe of the party changed from celebrating my success to him recounting his latest Tinder dates in graphic detail.

At one point, I tried to steer the conversation back to the celebration, mentioning how I was looking forward to starting my new job. Instead of congratulating me, he dismissed it and said, ""Well, I guess we all have to move on from high school jobs sometime, right?"" That stung, but I let it go.

Then, when it was time for the cake, I brought it out and was about to cut it when he decided to make a huge deal about how he was on a new diet and couldn’t eat sugar. He loudly asked if anyone remembered that time he lost 20 pounds and how he’d never let himself go back. I could see my other friends rolling their eyes.

Feeling frustrated, I snapped a bit and said something like, “Not everything has to revolve around your diet, Mark. It’s my celebration!” The room got quiet, and he looked hurt. I immediately felt bad, but I was also tired of him making everything about himself.

Later, I apologized for snapping at him, but he just brushed it off and continued to sulk. Now, I can't help but think that maybe I shouldn’t have lost my cool, but at the same time, he was being really inconsiderate.

She insisted that splitting rent 50/50 is fair regardless of our salaries and told me I should either find a better-paying job or cut back on my personal expenses.

They have been living together for about a year in a small apartment, and while their relationship has generally been good, some tensions have been brewing lately.

Alex is a pretty laid-back person, but he recently started a new job that requires him to work long hours and occasionally bring work home. Because of this, he’s been coming home late and often still needs to work after hours. Sam, on the other hand, has been working from home for a while and has become increasingly frustrated with the noise that Alex makes while working late.

One evening, Alex was on a video call with his boss while trying to finish up an important project. He was unaware that Sam had planned a movie night with some friends, and when they arrived, they were quite loud and started blasting music. Alex, feeling overwhelmed, asked them to keep it down since he was in the middle of an important meeting. Sam felt embarrassed in front of his friends and told Alex he was being too uptight and that he needed to relax and enjoy life a bit more.

Things escalated, and they ended up having an argument about their living habits. Alex felt that he had a right to work in peace, especially since he was putting in extra hours, while Sam felt that he was being inconsiderate by interrupting their plans. Eventually, Sam called Alex selfish and accused him of not caring about their friendship, while Alex shot back that Sam was being inconsiderate of his job obligations.

After the argument, they both went to their separate rooms, but the tension lingered. Alex felt bad for ruining Sam's night, but he also felt like he needed to stand up for himself regarding his work situation.

Honestly, I didn’t mean to be rude, but the thought of missing a whole day of camping really got to me, and I said we could just skip breakfast altogether if he was going to be this slow. 

By the time we finished eating and finally hit the road, we had lost several hours. When we got to the campsite, it was already late afternoon, and I was barely able to set up my tent before the sun started going down. I expressed my disappointment and told him I felt like he just didn’t care about our plans, which made him defensive. He said I was overreacting and that it was just a camping trip, but I felt like he was dismissing my feelings.

We ended up arguing a bit while setting up, and it kind of put a damper on the whole trip. We both said things we didn’t mean, and now things feel tense between us. I might have been too harsh, but I also feel like he could have tried harder to stick to our plan.

Everyone sucks here,"A few months ago, I (32F) was at a family gathering when my sister (30F) announced that she was pregnant. While everyone was excited, I couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy. My sister has always been the golden child — she graduated top of her class, has a great job, and now she’s going to be a mother while I’m still trying to figure out my career and personal life. 

Later that night, in a moment of weakness, I brought up how I felt to my sister. I told her that I was envious of her life and that I sometimes felt like the family disappointment. Instead of being supportive, she became defensive and said I was just being petty. This escalated into a heated argument where I ended up saying some hurtful things about how she wouldn’t be able to handle the challenges of being a parent because she’s always had everything handed to her. 

At that point, our parents tried to intervene, but I was too emotional and defensive. I felt misunderstood and lashed out, saying things I really didn't mean. My sister ended up crying and storming out, and my parents were left trying to calm the situation, expressing disappointment in both of us.

After a few days, I reached out to my sister to apologize for my words, but she hasn’t responded. I feel bad for my outburst, but I also think she could have been more empathetic about my feelings. 

I’ve been reflecting on the whole situation and feel like I acted like an asshole, but I also think my sister could have handled my feelings better. So, AITA for exploding at my sister during a vulnerable moment?",636,2852,0.87,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_14569,2021-01-31 00:00:00,ESH,1561,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I recently attended a party hosted by a mutual friend. There were a lot of people there, and I didn’t know most of them. I was having a decent time until I started talking to this girl who was really into astrology. I’m not a huge believer in it, but I didn’t want to be rude, so I listened. She started asking me about my sign and what I thought of astrology in general.

I made a few jokes about how I didn’t think my life was dictated by the stars, saying something like, “If my destiny is written in the stars, it must be in a very messy handwriting.” She didn’t take it well. She became defensive and started lecturing me about how astrology is a legitimate belief system for many people and how I was being dismissive.

At that point, I thought it would be funny to push her buttons a bit more, so I pretended to be interested and asked her to read my horoscope. She seemed excited, so I played along, but I couldn’t help but throw in a few more sarcastic comments while she was trying to explain the traits of my sign. She got visibly upset and eventually walked away.

Later on, I overheard her complaining to another guest about how rude I was. I felt a bit guilty, but I also thought she was being overly sensitive. I sent her a message later on, trying to apologize for my comments, but I added that she could lighten up a bit. She didn’t respond, which I took as a sign that she was still mad.

In the end, I felt like I was just trying to have a bit of fun, while she was taking everything too seriously. AITA?",42,1391,0.67,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_27613,2022-09-27 00:00:00,ESH,1523,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"This happened a few years ago when I was in my late teens.

I was part of a small group of friends who loved to hang out together, and we often went to a local park to play sports or just chill. There was this one guy in our group, Jake, who had a habit of making really inappropriate jokes. Most of the time, we let it slide because he was entertaining, but sometimes he crossed the line.

One day, we were all hanging out at the park, and Jake started making fun of a girl who was practicing her dance routine nearby. He was imitating her moves and laughing loudly, thinking it was hilarious. I felt really bad for her; she was clearly focused and didn’t deserve to be mocked like that. I said something like, ""Dude, that’s not cool. Just let her be,"" but Jake brushed it off and kept going.

In a moment of frustration, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I went over to the girl and told her that Jake was just joking and not to take it seriously. I thought I was being supportive, but it inadvertently drew more attention to her and made her feel worse. She looked embarrassed and just packed up her things and left. 

When I got back to my friends, Jake was furious. He thought I was trying to humiliate him in front of everyone and called me a “buzzkill.” We ended up arguing, and I threw in some insults about his immaturity, which only made things worse.

I felt guilty for how the situation turned out. I didn’t mean to embarrass the girl further, and I also regretted how I handled things with Jake. Looking back, I think we both acted like assholes—Jake for his mean behavior and me for not managing the situation better and escalating things into an argument.

So, AITA for intervening when Jake was making fun of that girl, even though it ended up causing more trouble?",139,615,0.66,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_24883,2021-10-19 00:00:00,ESH,1792,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I recently had a disagreement about how to handle our neighbor's loud music during the weekends. Our neighbor throws parties almost every Saturday night, and while I get that people want to have fun, it often goes until the early hours of the morning, making it impossible for us to get a good night's sleep.

I wanted to approach the neighbor directly and ask them to keep the volume down or at least end the parties earlier. My partner, however, thought it would be better to call the police if it got too loud, arguing that they need to learn a lesson. I felt that calling the police would escalate the situation and potentially create bad blood between us and the neighbors.

Eventually, out of frustration, I decided to knock on their door one night during a party and ask them to lower the music. It was awkward, and while they did turn it down, I could tell they were annoyed. When I returned home, my partner was upset that I didn’t just let them deal with it as they wanted and accused me of making the situation worse.

Looking back, I can see both sides: I should have communicated better with my partner instead of acting impulsively, and maybe we should have worked together on a more diplomatic approach.

I was feeling a bit impatient because I had a meeting to get to soon, so I ordered quickly and stepped aside to wait for my drink.

While I was waiting, I noticed a woman (30s) who had just come in and walked straight to the counter, bypassing the queue entirely. She stood there, looking at the menu as if she had just arrived, while all of us who had been waiting were visibly annoyed. My friend and I exchanged glances, and I couldn’t help but say a bit loudly, “Wow, some people think they can just cut in line!” 

The woman turned around, looked at me, and said, “I didn’t cut in line; I was just trying to order.” I replied, “You should have waited like everyone else.” At that point, she got really defensive and said, “You don’t know what I’ve been through today!” 

Things escalated, and we ended up having a heated exchange where I raised my voice a bit and she started gesturing angrily. My friend tried to step in and calm things down, but it didn’t really help. Eventually, the barista called out my name for my drink, and I grabbed it and left, feeling frustrated with the whole situation.

Later, my friend told me I could have handled it better and that my comment might have come off as rude and unnecessary. I guess we both contributed to the tension, which made it worse.

Everyone sucks here,"For as long as I can remember, my parents have had a very volatile relationship. They argue constantly, often in front of my younger siblings and me. I’ve always tried to be the peacemaker, stepping in to diffuse situations and support them both, but it’s taken a toll on me emotionally. 

Recently, I decided I needed to prioritize my own mental health and well-being, so I started setting boundaries. This included telling my parents that I wouldn’t get involved in their arguments anymore and that I needed them to figure out their issues on their own. My mom took this really hard and accused me of abandoning her when she needs support, while my dad said I was being overly dramatic and that it was just a normal part of family life.

In the midst of all this, I also had a lot of schoolwork and personal issues to handle. One day, after a particularly tense argument where I told them both to stop fighting in front of us, my mom snapped and called me ungrateful for not helping her through the rough times. She said I was being selfish and should be more understanding of her struggles.

Feeling hurt and overwhelmed, I retaliated by blasting music in my room to drown them out and ignoring their calls for help around the house. I didn’t assist with chores or even check in on my siblings, which I usually do. I knew I was being a bit of an asshole, but I felt justified given the circumstances. 

Now, there’s a lot of tension in the house. My parents are still fighting, my siblings are confused about why I’m no longer helping out, and I just feel like I’m in the middle of a mess I didn’t create.

So, I (27F) have a close-knit group of friends that I've known since college. There are about six of us who hang out regularly. One of my friends, Sarah (26F), has been struggling a lot lately with her mental health. She's been very open about it, and while I do my best to support her, it’s been draining for me and others in the group.

Recently, Sarah started isolating herself even more. She would cancel plans last minute and sometimes wouldn’t respond to texts. I understand that she’s going through a tough time, but it’s been hard for me and the others to stay motivated to include her when she’s consistently unavailable.

In our group chat, we all started venting about how Sarah’s behavior is affecting our dynamic. We would say things like “it’s exhausting always reaching out” and “I just wish she’d be more present.” It wasn’t mean-spirited, just frustration boiling over. But I did feel guilty for saying those things.

One day, our friend Mike (28M) decided to confront Sarah about her behavior in a way that was honestly pretty harsh. He told her that she was being selfish and that we were all tired of her canceling plans. Sarah was understandably hurt. She ended up in tears and left the chat, saying she needed to take a break from everyone.

After that, I felt horrible. I knew I hadn’t defended her when we were talking about her in the chat, and now we had essentially pushed her away. I felt complicit in Mike’s confrontation, and I didn’t speak up when I should have.

Now, everyone’s feeling guilty, and the group is kind of in shambles because Sarah feels betrayed. I’m wondering if I should reach out to her and apologize for not standing up for her, but I’m also worried it might just make things worse.

I have a sister who recently had a baby, and she’s been overwhelmed with the new responsibilities. I offered to help her out by watching her baby a couple of times a week to give her a break, which I thought would be a nice gesture.

However, my partner has been feeling neglected. He works long hours and comes home to find me busy with the baby. He expressed that he feels like I’m not prioritizing our relationship and that it feels like I'm taking on too much responsibility for my sister instead of focusing on us. I tried to explain that I was just trying to help her out, but I could see he was hurt and frustrated.

Last week, I had my sister’s baby over for a longer period than usual because she had a family emergency. My partner came home to a chaotic situation. He snapped at me and said I needed to stop being the “family babysitter” and focus on our life together. I got defensive and told him that it’s not just about us; family is important too, and he should understand that.

In the heat of the moment, we both said things we didn’t mean. I accused him of being selfish for not wanting to support my sister in her time of need. He accused me of neglecting our relationship for someone else’s problems. It escalated to the point where we ended up arguing late into the night.

After things cooled down, I realized that while I was trying to help, I hadn’t been paying enough attention to my partner's feelings. He also acknowledged that he could have been more supportive and understanding of my desire to help my family.

I’ve tried to support him by inviting him out, helping him with his resume, and just being there to listen. 

Recently, our mutual friend Sarah (27F) hosted a small gathering to lift everyone’s spirits. I thought it would be a good opportunity for Jake to socialize and potentially network a bit. However, the night took a weird turn when Jake started drinking heavily and began venting about his struggles, which quickly escalated into him making snarky comments about everyone’s jobs and their “boring” lives.

At first, I tried to laugh it off and change the subject, but then he targeted Sarah, saying her job was meaningless and that she must not be very bright for working in a field that “doesn’t matter.” Everyone went quiet, and Sarah ended up leaving the room in tears. I was furious and confronted Jake, telling him that he was being a jerk and that he needed to apologize. Instead of realizing his mistake, he got defensive and said he was just being honest and that people needed to toughen up.

After a few months, I started feeling overwhelmed by our financial situation. I suggested that since he makes so much more than I do, it would be fair for him to contribute a larger percentage to the rent. I proposed a 60/40 split, where I would pay 40% of the rent and he would cover the remaining 60%. I thought this would help ease my financial burden and be a more equitable arrangement.

He was really upset by my suggestion and told me that splitting everything down the middle was fair and that I should manage my finances better. He said that if I wanted to pay less, I should just get a better-paying job. I felt hurt and unappreciated, so I refused to back down and insisted that my proposal was reasonable.

Before I left for the party, I told my partner that I would be out for a few hours and asked if he could handle dinner for our kids. He assured me he would.

About an hour into the party, the neighbor from the apartment next door knocked on my door. He looked visibly annoyed and asked us to keep the noise down since he had a baby that was trying to sleep. I apologized and promised to lower the volume, but honestly, it felt a bit harsh to interrupt our gathering.

Sarah often mentions how she wants to be as authentic as possible, which I respect, but she’s also been super vocal about how much she hates therapy and refuses to seek professional help.

A couple of months ago, we started discussing the idea of moving in together, which we both want, but we couldn’t agree on the details.

One of the major sticking points has been my partner’s dog. He has a very energetic and somewhat mischievous golden retriever who tends to get into everything, and I’ve expressed my concerns about how that might impact our living situation. I’m not a dog person, and while I understand that his dog is part of his life, I worry about the potential mess and chaos that could ensue.

We had a big argument about this last week. I suggested that maybe we should consider getting a dog trainer or even looking into a pet-sitting service for when we’re both busy. My partner took this as me not being supportive of him or his dog, which led to a heated discussion. In the heat of the moment, I said something like, “If you care more about your dog than about our future together, maybe we shouldn’t move in at all.” 

That comment really hurt him, and he accused me of being selfish and not understanding how much his dog means to him. I can see now that I was overly harsh and didn’t consider his feelings. But on the other hand, I felt like I was only trying to express my genuine concerns about how we could make living together work.

After our argument, we both ended up feeling upset and misunderstood. He posted on social media about feeling torn between his love for his dog and his partner, which made me feel frustrated, as I thought we should have resolved it privately rather than airing our issues publicly.

Everyone sucks here,"I (M/28) recently found myself in a complicated situation with my girlfriend, Sarah (F/26), and my best friend, Mark (M/29). Sarah and I have been dating for over a year, and while we have a good relationship, there have been some struggles, especially when it comes to communication.

A few weeks ago, Mark invited me out for drinks to celebrate a job promotion. I agreed, but I didn't tell Sarah right away because I knew she'd be a bit unhappy about me going out without her. We usually do things together, and she often expresses that she feels neglected when I hang out with friends.

That night, I had a great time with Mark, and we ended up talking about some personal stuff, including my relationship. I mentioned that I felt overwhelmed at times and that it might be good for me to have some time to myself. Mark agreed and suggested that maybe I shouldn't feel so guilty about spending time away from Sarah when I need a break.

The next day, I casually mentioned to Sarah that I went out with Mark. She immediately got upset, accusing me of hiding things from her and not being supportive of the relationship. I tried to explain that I didn't want to hurt her feelings but that I needed some space sometimes. Instead of understanding, she got even more upset, saying that I was selfish for thinking I could prioritize my own needs over the relationship.

Feeling defensive, I fired back and said that she was being unreasonable and that she needed to be more understanding of my need for personal time. Our conversation escalated, and we ended up arguing for hours over it.

In the end, we both ended up feeling hurt and frustrated with each other. I know I should've communicated better about my plans, but I also think Sarah could’ve approached the situation with more understanding. 

AITA for wanting personal time and not telling Sarah about my night with Mark beforehand, while she was overreacting about it?",372,1611,0.51,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_30029,2021-10-29 00:00:00,ESH,1925,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I recently had a falling out with my best friend, and I’m still processing what happened. We’ve been friends for over a decade, and for the most part, we get along really well. However, we have different views about social gatherings, especially regarding how we deal with our mutual friends.

Last month, we were invited to a birthday party for another friend. I was excited to go, but I also mentioned to her that I was feeling a bit overwhelmed with social interactions lately. I’m more introverted, and large groups can drain me quickly. She assured me that it would be a small gathering, so I decided to go.

When we arrived, the party was much bigger than either of us had anticipated. There were people everywhere, and I started feeling anxious almost immediately. I tried to engage and have fun, but after an hour, I felt like I needed to step outside for some fresh air. My friend wanted to stay and socialize, and I didn’t want to pull her away from the group.

So, I told her I’d be outside for a bit and that she could stay. I thought it was understood that I just needed a moment to breathe, but instead, she decided to leave the party and come outside with me. I was surprised and a bit annoyed because I felt it was my choice to take a break, and she didn’t need to stop having fun just because I was feeling overwhelmed.

When we got outside, I tried to explain that I appreciated her concern, but I wanted her to enjoy the party. Instead of understanding, she got upset, saying that I should have just told her I wanted to leave if I didn’t want to be there. I felt like it was unfair for her to put that on me when I was trying to manage my own feelings. We ended up having a heated argument right there, and I said some things I didn’t mean in the heat of the moment, like how tired I was of her always needing to be around people and how she didn’t understand my boundaries. 

In the end, we both left the party early, and now she’s not talking to me. I feel bad about how things escalated, but I also think she overreacted by not respecting my need for space. I’m just confused about how to approach this situation. Did I handle it poorly, or was she being unreasonable?

Everyone sucks here,"I have a younger brother who is 16, and we’ve always had a pretty close relationship, or at least I thought we did. I’m 21 and I’ve been living on my own for a couple of years now. Recently, I moved into a new apartment and invited my brother over to spend the weekend. I wanted to show him my place and we planned to hang out, play video games, and just catch up.

On the first night, everything was going well. We were having fun, but then I noticed that he kept texting someone all night. I didn’t think much of it until he started getting really excited about it and laughing. I asked him who he was texting, and he just said, “Oh, just a friend.” I let it go, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off.

The next day, I went out to run some errands, and when I returned, I found my brother in my room, talking to someone on video chat. I assumed it was the same friend he had been texting. I knocked on the door, and when he opened it, I saw that it was actually a girl I knew from high school who had been very mean to me back then. I voiced my surprise at her being there, and my brother looked embarrassed. He quickly ended the call, saying she just wanted to talk to him.

I lost my cool a bit. I told him that I didn’t want someone in my space who had bullied me in the past and that he should have respected my boundaries by not inviting her over without asking me first. My brother got defensive and told me that I was overreacting and that he was just being friendly. I ended up raising my voice, saying he could have at least respected my feelings since I had opened my home to him.

The argument escalated, and I told him that he needed to leave my apartment if he couldn’t respect my wishes. He got really upset and left, saying I was being an awful brother. I felt guilty after he left, but I was also frustrated that he didn’t see where I was coming from. I reached out later to apologize for how I reacted, but I stood by the fact that he should have communicated better.

Now my parents are involved, and they think we both handled it poorly. They say I should have been more understanding and that my brother has the right to invite friends over. I feel torn because I don’t want to create a rift between us, but I also feel like my feelings were valid.

Everyone sucks here,"Last weekend, I decided to throw a small gathering at my apartment for a few friends to unwind after a long week. I invited about five people, and everyone said they’d bring a snack or drink to share. My friend Jake, who I’ve known for years, said he’d bring his famous guacamole, which I was really looking forward to.

When everyone arrived, we started the night off right, chatting and laughing. I noticed Jake brought a tiny bowl of guacamole, but I didn’t think much of it at the time. As the night went on, people started digging into the snacks, and it quickly became apparent that Jake's guacamole was going fast. I decided to grab a big scoop for myself, but when I went to scoop it out, I realized there was hardly any left.

I jokingly said, ""Wow, Jake, did you really think that little bowl would be enough for all of us?"" He laughed but looked kind of embarrassed. I figured he’d want to share, so I continued to take some guacamole anyway, ignoring the fact that it was almost gone.

As the night progressed, Jake grew visibly upset. When I noticed, I asked him what was wrong, and he snapped, ""It’s just that it’s my guacamole, and you just took the last of it without even asking!"" I felt a bit taken aback, but I brushed it off and made a joke about how he should’ve brought more if he wanted to keep it to himself.

The mood shifted, and tensions rose. I tried to lighten the atmosphere, but Jake wouldn’t let it go. He ended up leaving early, and a few of my other friends started arguing about who should’ve brought what. Everyone kind of turned on each other, and it made the rest of the night awkward.

After everyone left, I felt guilty about how the night turned out. I didn’t mean to upset Jake, but I also think he overreacted about the guacamole. I texted him later to apologize for not considering how much he brought, but I still think he could have handled it better too.

Everyone sucks here,"I’m in a bit of a complicated situation and could really use some outside perspective. 

I (19M) have a younger brother, Jake (15M), who has been dealing with some serious issues at school. For the past few months, he’s been bullied by a group of kids in his grade. It’s mostly verbal harassment, but it’s really taken a toll on him. I’ve tried to support him by encouraging him to talk to our parents or to a school counselor, but he’s been reluctant to do anything about it. He feels very isolated and doesn’t think anyone will help him.

Recently, he came to me very upset, saying he wanted to drop out of school and move in with our grandparents in another state because he couldn't take the bullying anymore. I totally get that it’s tough for him, but I just didn’t think that was the right solution. I told him that running away from the problem wasn’t going to help and that he needed to learn to stand up for himself instead of just escaping.

I was pretty harsh with him during our conversation. I told him that he needed to toughen up and that everyone faces challenges in life. I might have said something like, “You’re just being weak. You need to face this head-on rather than running away.” I thought I was giving him some tough love, but it clearly hurt him and made him feel even more alone.

To make matters worse, my parents found out about our conversation and were furious with me. They said I was being a terrible brother and that I needed to be more supportive. They suggested that we talk to a family therapist about it, which I initially refused because I thought it was unnecessary. I was frustrated and said something like, “So now I’m supposed to coddle him because he can’t handle a few mean words?” 

Now, Jake is even more withdrawn, and I feel guilty for not being more understanding.  At the same time, I think my parents are overreacting a bit. They want to hold family meetings and therapy sessions for something that I believe should be resolved without dragging everyone into it. I just wanted Jake to be stronger and deal with his problems; I didn’t realize I was pushing him away.

So, I guess I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for trying to toughen him up but also not being supportive enough. ESH?",524,1097,0.95,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_22693,2023-08-28 00:00:00,ESH,2236,AITA

Recently, I've started to notice that she has a habit of leaving dirty dishes in the sink for days at a time.

One evening, after a long day at work, I came home to find that she had left a mountain of dirty dishes in the sink again. I tried to be patient, but I snapped and confronted her about it. I told her that it was really inconsiderate to leave the dishes for so long, especially since I had mentioned it to her before. I raised my voice a bit, which I regret, but I was just so frustrated.

In response, she got defensive and yelled back at me, saying I was overreacting and that I needed to chill out. She pointed out that I sometimes forget to take out the trash and that my messiness can be annoying too. Honestly, she had a point, but it felt like she was deflecting from the issue at hand. 

The argument escalated, and we both ended up saying things we didn’t mean. I called her lazy, and she accused me of being a control freak. Afterward, we both cooled down, but I couldn't shake the feeling that we both acted like jerks.

Last week, we went out to dinner together, and I noticed she ordered a salad while I went for the burger and fries. As we were eating, I made a joke about how I must be the unhealthy friend, and she laughed but then got really quiet. I asked her what was wrong, and she said she felt bad about her choices.

I then got defensive, saying I was only trying to help and that she shouldn’t feel bad about enjoying food. This led to a heated argument where I accused her of being overly sensitive, and she said I was being dismissive of her struggle.

I have a 10-year-old daughter, and my partner has a 12-year-old son. They don't always get along, but we do our best to encourage a relationship between them.

Recently, we planned a family camping trip for the weekend. Everyone was excited, but the morning of the trip, my daughter woke up with a terrible headache and felt nauseous. I didn't want to risk her getting worse, so I suggested that we postpone the trip until the following weekend. My partner was frustrated, saying that his son was really looking forward to it and that we shouldn't let one person ruin the plans for everyone else. I understood his point, but I stood firm, saying that my daughter's health was the priority.

We ended up having a heated argument. I accused him of being insensitive to how my daughter felt, while he accused me of being overly dramatic about a headache. In the heat of the moment, I made a dig about how my daughter’s health matters more than his son's feelings, and he shot back that maybe I was just using her headache as an excuse to avoid spending time with his family.

In the end, we decided to go ahead with the trip without my daughter. I felt guilty about leaving her behind, but I thought it was better for the family to stick to the plan. During the trip, my partner’s son was moody, and when I called to check on my daughter, she sounded upset and lonely. I felt terrible.

I thought it would be fine, as we both have the space and want to support her.

However, things took a turn when she arrived with her two kids, who are quite young and energetic. I get it—kids can be a handful, and I appreciate my girlfriend wanting to help her friend out. The problem is that my girlfriend didn’t set any boundaries before she came over. 

From the moment they arrived, the kids were running around the house, knocking over things, and getting into my stuff. I tried to be patient at first, but after a couple of days, I was getting pretty frustrated. I work from home, and the noise made it really hard to focus. I mentioned to my girlfriend that it was tough for me to concentrate, and maybe we should set up some rules for the kids, like no playing in certain areas of the house or at least keeping the noise down during my working hours.

My girlfriend took this the wrong way and became defensive. She felt like I was being too harsh on her friend and her kids. One night, I ended up snapping a bit after one of the kids accidentally spilled juice all over my laptop. I yelled at them to be more careful, which I immediately regretted.

So, I (28F) have a close group of friends, and for the past year, we’ve been meeting up for game nights every two weeks. It’s something we all look forward to, and everyone usually brings snacks. I’m the only one who is gluten-free due to health issues, but I’m pretty chill about it and often bring my own snacks to share.

Last week, we had a game night at my friend Alex’s place. He’s known for his cooking and decided to make homemade pizza for everyone.

When I got there, I noticed that Alex had gone all out with the pizza, and it looked amazing. I complimented him, but then he made a joke about my gluten-free pizza, saying, “I guess we can’t all eat like normal people!” I laughed it off, but I was a bit hurt. 

When it was time to eat, I offered my gluten-free pizza to everyone, and while some people were polite and tried it, a couple of my friends made faces and said things like, “I could never eat that.” In the moment, I felt defensive and snapped back, “Well, at least I’m not going to end up sick after this!” It got a little awkward, and I could tell I had brought the mood down.

Afterwards, Alex and a few others discussed how my reaction was over the top and that I shouldn’t take jokes so seriously. I felt bad because I do appreciate humor, but it also felt like they were being inconsiderate about my dietary restrictions.

Everyone sucks here,"Throwaway account for privacy reasons.

I’ve been living in my apartment for a couple of years now, and I generally get along well with my neighbors. Recently, though, I’ve had some tension with one of them, Sarah, who lives directly above me. 

To give some context, Sarah has two young kids, probably around 4 and 6 years old. They’re energetic, which I totally understand—kids are kids. However, they often run around and jump, making a lot of noise during the evening hours when I’m trying to relax after work. I’ve tried to be patient and understanding, but it’s been frustrating. 

Last week, the noise got especially loud while I was trying to enjoy a quiet evening. I could hear the kids laughing and running, and it felt like they were stomping around on the floor. I decided to knock on her door to politely ask if she could try to keep it down a bit during the later hours. 

When Sarah answered, I was calm and friendly, but she immediately got defensive and started making excuses about how kids are just being kids. I acknowledged that I understood, but I asked if she could please try to keep it quieter in the evenings. Our conversation escalated quickly, and before I knew it, we were both raising our voices. She accused me of being a grumpy neighbor, and I called her inconsiderate for not being mindful of the noise late at night.

After our argument, I felt bad about how it turned out. I knew I could have approached the conversation better, but I was genuinely at my wits' end. Sarah then started complaining to other neighbors about me, which made me feel even worse.

Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I have been living together for about a year now, and we’ve had our share of disagreements, but recently things escalated over something pretty silly. 

We were having a casual dinner with some friends when the topic of pets came up. I have a cat that I adopted before we moved in together, and my partner has always been a bit indifferent towards her. During the conversation, one of our friends made a joke about how my cat is spoiled, and I jokingly agreed, saying that my partner treats her like a queen. 

I didn’t think much of it, but my partner took offense and got visibly upset. After our friends left, they confronted me about making fun of them in front of others. I tried to explain that I was just joking and that it wasn’t meant to be serious, but they continued to insist that I was belittling their feelings about the cat. 

In a moment of frustration, I snapped and said that if they can’t handle a lighthearted joke about a pet, then maybe they need to loosen up a bit. That really set them off, and we ended up having a heated argument where we both said things we didn’t mean. 

Looking back, I realize that I should have been more sensitive to their feelings, especially since they’ve never been a huge fan of my cat. At the same time, I felt like my partner overreacted to something that was supposed to be fun.

Everyone sucks here,"My friend Sam and I have been close for years, and we often hang out together. Recently, we decided to go on a weekend trip to the beach. We both agreed to split the costs for the hotel and food. I took care of booking the hotel and paid upfront, which came to $300. Sam said he’d cover food and drinks, so we were good to go.

While we were on the trip, I noticed that Sam was being pretty cheap. He kept suggesting we eat at fast-food places to save money, even when I wanted to try some local restaurants. I didn’t want to ruin the trip, so I went along with it, but it was frustrating. By the end of the weekend, when it was time to settle up, Sam asked how much he owed for the hotel. I told him it was $150 since we were splitting it.

He looked at me surprised and said, “I thought we were just going to cover our own expenses. I was planning to only pay for food.” I was taken aback because we had agreed to split everything, and I reminded him of that. He got defensive and said he didn’t remember agreeing to pay half for the hotel and that he thought it was unfair since he didn’t want to spend that much on a place.

I ended up feeling annoyed and insisted he pay me the full amount since we had a clear agreement. He eventually paid, but he was clearly upset about it. Later that night, during a conversation about the trip, I made a joke about him being stingy, and he shot back that I was being a greedy friend for expecting him to pay more.

Everyone sucks here,"I (29F) have been dating my boyfriend (30M) for about two years now. We’ve had our ups and downs, but overall, I thought we had a solid relationship. Recently, my best friend (28F) has been going through a rough patch in her marriage, and I've been trying to support her as much as I can. 

A few weeks ago, she confided in me about some deeply personal issues she was facing with her husband. I felt honored that she trusted me enough to share that, and I tried my best to be a good listener and offer advice. However, as the weeks went on, I started to notice that my boyfriend was getting increasingly jealous of the time I was spending with her. He made comments about how I was ""always"" with her and how he felt like he was being pushed aside.

In a moment of frustration, I snapped back at him during an argument and said that if he couldn’t handle me supporting my friend through a hard time, then maybe he wasn’t the right person for me. I was upset and felt he was being unreasonable, but in hindsight, I realize I could have expressed my feelings better. 

Then, things escalated when my friend began leaning on me more and more, and I found myself spending almost every weekend with her. My boyfriend confronted me again, and in a heated moment, I told him that I needed to prioritize my friend’s mental health over his feelings. I could see the hurt in his eyes, but I felt like I was doing the right thing for my friend.

Now my boyfriend is upset and feels neglected, and my friend is still struggling with her marriage. I feel torn because I want to help my friend, but I also don’t want to lose my boyfriend. I suspect that I’ve hurt both of them in different ways, and I’m starting to wonder if I handled this whole situation poorly. 

So, AITA for prioritizing my friend over my boyfriend when she clearly needed me? Or did I have a right to stand up for my friend? I feel like I’ve created a mess and everyone is suffering because of my decisions. ESH?",223,1385,0.98,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_33970,2019-01-08 00:00:00,ESH,1971,AITA

My friend is a fantastic baker, and I pride myself on my savory dishes. Recently, we decided to have a cook-off at my place, inviting a few mutual friends to judge.

The cook-off turned competitive, as expected. I made a delicious pasta dish, while my friend prepared a fancy cake. When it was time for the tasting, everyone seemed to enjoy both, but my dish got a lot more compliments. My friend was visibly annoyed but put on a brave face.

Later that night, while cleaning up, I jokingly said something like, “Well, looks like my savory skills are unbeatable! Better stick to baking!” It was meant to be lighthearted, but my friend snapped back and said, “Maybe if you could bake anything other than box mix, you’d know what real cooking is.” 

I was irritated by the comment, and we ended up arguing. I brought up how my friend is always so focused on baking that they neglect making a complete meal, while I can throw together a full dinner. The argument escalated, and we both ended up saying hurtful things.

In the end, we cooled off separately, but the tension lingered. I feel bad for how it turned out, but at the same time, I think my friend was being overly sensitive about the whole thing.

Everyone sucks here,"I recently had a falling out with my sister over our family’s upcoming holiday gathering. She has two kids, and I have one, and let’s just say our parenting styles are worlds apart. My sister believes in a very permissive approach. Her kids run wild, eat junk food for every meal, and have zero boundaries. My daughter, on the other hand, is more reserved and well-behaved, but she tends to get overwhelmed in chaotic environments.

Last year at the same gathering, my niece and nephew were climbing on furniture, throwing food, and generally causing chaos. My daughter ended up in tears after one of her cousins knocked her down while trying to run past her. It was a mess. I ended up having to take her home early because I couldn’t handle seeing her so upset.

When I heard about this year's gathering, I expressed my concerns to my sister. I suggested that we could have a separate space for the kids to ensure they don’t get too rowdy and overwhelm my daughter again. I thought this was a reasonable request given last year's experience. But my sister blew up at me, claiming I was trying to control her kids and that I was being overdramatic. She insisted that her kids were just having fun and that my daughter needed to toughen up and learn to deal with it.

Feeling frustrated, I told her that if she couldn’t keep her kids in check, I would reconsider bringing my daughter. I didn’t want to put her through another stressful day. My sister seemed to take this as a personal attack on her parenting, and honestly, I didn’t handle the situation as well as I could have either. I could have approached it less confrontationally, but I was just so worried about my daughter.

Now there’s tension between us, and I feel guilty because I love my sister, but I also want to protect my daughter. At the same time, I recognize that I might have been too harsh in my approach.

Everyone sucks here,"This happened a couple of weeks ago at a local coffee shop where I usually go to study. I was sitting in my usual corner, laptop open, when a guy came in and sat at the table next to mine. He seemed nice enough at first, just quietly working on his own stuff. However, after about 20 minutes, I noticed he kept glancing at me and then at my screen like he was trying to see what I was working on. 

I felt uncomfortable, but I tried to brush it off. Then, out of nowhere, he leaned over and said, ""Hey, I couldn't help but notice you look really focused. What are you working on?"" I smiled politely and said, ""Just some schoolwork,"" thinking that would end the conversation. But then he asked if I was a student and started asking me a bunch of personal questions. 

I told him I preferred to keep my work private, but he didn't seem to take the hint. He started leaning closer and making comments about how he thought it was cool I was studying so hard. At this point, I felt really uneasy, especially since I was alone and trying to concentrate.

I lost my patience and raised my voice a bit, saying, ""Can you please stop bothering me? I'm just trying to work here!"" It felt like a justified response since he was invading my space and making me uncomfortable. But then he got defensive and said, “Wow, chill out. I was just trying to be friendly.” 

People in the coffee shop turned to look, and I felt embarrassed. I thought I'd overreacted, but I was also frustrated that he wouldn't take no for an answer. After a moment, I felt bad and apologized, saying, “I’m sorry, I just really need to focus.” But he just rolled his eyes and muttered something under his breath about me being rude.

Looking back, I realize we both could have handled the situation better. I probably shouldn't have yelled at him; it made the whole scene awkward for everyone around us.

We decided to adopt a dog together about a year ago, a sweet rescue pup named Max. I love Max, but I’ve been feeling overwhelmed managing him on top of my work schedule, especially since my partner often travels for work.

I’ve been trying to train Max and make sure he gets enough exercise, but sometimes I struggle to find the time. When my partner is home, he often lets Max jump on him and gives him treats, which I’ve been trying to limit to encourage better behavior. Last week, I came home from a long day at work to find Max had chewed up my favorite pair of shoes. I was frustrated and upset, especially since I had expressed my concerns to my partner about being consistent with Max’s training.

I confronted my partner about it, and our discussion quickly turned into an argument. He insisted that I was being too strict and that I needed to relax a bit with Max. I snapped and told him that if he cared as much about Max’s training as he did about playing with him, this wouldn’t have happened. He got defensive, saying that I was being unfair and that he was just trying to bond with our dog. In a moment of anger, I told him he was being irresponsible and that I often feel like I’m the only one putting in the effort.

Things escalated, and I ended up posting a vent on social media about how I felt like I was the only one taking our dog’s training seriously and that my partner was just treating Max like a toy. This upset my partner, and he went online to defend himself, saying I was exaggerating and making him look bad. Our friends started weighing in, and it turned into a big mess.

Recently, we went to a dinner party at their house, which they hosted. It was a lovely evening, and everyone seemed to have a great time. However, throughout the night, the husband kept making jokes at the expense of my partner's cooking skills. My partner is a great cook, and I could tell that they were getting increasingly uncomfortable as the night went on. 

At first, I tried to laugh it off, thinking it was just playful banter. But as the comments kept coming, I could see my partner's mood shift. They were clearly upset but didn’t want to make a scene. I finally decided to step in and called the husband out, saying, ""Hey, those jokes are getting old. My partner cooks delicious meals, and it's not cool to keep making fun of them."" 

The atmosphere shifted immediately. The husband got defensive and claimed he was just joking, but I could see the tension in the room. The wife tried to smooth things over, but the damage was done. The evening ended awkwardly, and my partner was really hurt.

The next day, I received a message from the wife saying that they felt awkward about the whole situation and that they didn’t understand why I reacted so strongly. I felt a bit guilty because I did escalate things, but I also believed I was standing up for my partner. I can't shake the feeling that maybe I overreacted, but I also think the husband should be more considerate.

For some context, I (28F) have a younger brother, Jake (24M), who has been in a committed relationship with Sarah (23F) for about two years. Sarah has a daughter, Lily (3F), from a previous relationship. I’ve gotten pretty close with both of them, and I often help out by babysitting Lily when Sarah needs a break or has work commitments.

Last week, Sarah asked if I could take care of Lily for a few hours while she had an appointment. I happily agreed, but when I arrived, I noticed that Lily was acting a bit more hyper than usual. After about an hour, it became clear that she was overly tired and had a tantrum over a toy she wanted to play with. In an attempt to calm her down, I took the toy away and tried to redirect her attention to something else. 

Jake came home unexpectedly during this and saw me taking the toy. He immediately accused me of being too harsh with Lily, which made me defensive. I told him that I was just trying to get her to stop crying and that it's normal for toddlers to throw tantrums. He started arguing that I didn’t understand how to handle kids properly and that I needed to be more patient. 

In the heat of the argument, I snapped and told him that if he thinks I’m such a bad babysitter, maybe he should take care of her himself. That really hurt him, and he left the room visibly upset. I later apologized to both of them, but it felt like we were all on edge.

Honestly, I feel like I could have handled the situation better, and I should have been more understanding toward Jake's perspective. But Jake also doesn’t seem to recognize that I do my best to help out, and his sudden criticism felt a bit unfair to me. I really care about Lily and want the best for her, but I also felt like my efforts were being undermined.

So, a few days ago, I bought a big pack of my favorite snacks—these gourmet chips that I really love. I specifically told Mia they were for me and asked her to keep an eye on them. I was looking forward to enjoying them after a long week.

Last night, I came home from work and found Amanda on the couch, munching on my chips. I felt my blood boil. I confronted her, asking why she thought it was okay to take my stuff without asking. She shrugged and said she thought they were for everyone.

I told her those were mine and she should have asked. She got defensive and said it’s just snacks and that I was being dramatic. I snapped back, saying that if she wanted to live here, she needed to respect my things. That made her upset, and she started to cry, saying I was being mean over some chips.

Mia came in and tried to mediate, but I ended up getting frustrated and said that if Amanda can’t respect my boundaries, maybe she shouldn’t be living with us. Now both Mia and Amanda are upset with me, and I feel like I overreacted a bit.

I chuckled a bit but then realized he looked hurt. I went over to check on him and saw that he scraped his knee pretty badly.

They got defensive and started saying I was being rude. Frustrated, I told them they should learn how to be better friends. The kid with the scraped knee finally got up and said he was fine, and they all started to leave. I felt bad for yelling, but I thought they needed to hear it.

Later, I overheard the kids telling their parents about what happened. One of the parents approached me and said I had no right to yell at the kids, and that I should mind my own business. I argued back, saying I was just trying to help.

Early in the trip, we all agreed to share the costs of food and activities. One night, we decided to go out for dinner. I suggested a restaurant I had heard good things about, but one of my friends, Jenna, wanted to go somewhere else. The other two friends sided with Jenna, and they insisted on going to her choice instead. I felt a bit hurt and dismissed since I had really looked forward to the place I suggested.

When we got to Jenna’s restaurant, it turned out to be kind of a letdown. The food wasn’t great, and the atmosphere was chaotic. I couldn’t help but mention how much I would have preferred the restaurant I suggested. Jenna got defensive and said I was being passive-aggressive. I didn’t think I was being passive-aggressive, just expressing my disappointment.

Things got tense during dinner. Jenna snapped at me, and I responded by saying she could have just let it go instead of making a big deal about my opinion. The other two friends also chimed in, saying I was being too critical and that nobody wanted to hear me complain. I felt ganged up on and said something like, “Fine, next time I just won’t bother suggesting anything at all!”

I’m genuinely happy for her, but I also have to admit that her constant focus on dieting and exercise has started to wear on me.

We used to spend a lot of time together, but now it seems like every outing revolves around her meal plans or workout routines. I’m not into fitness the way she is, and I feel like I’m being judged for my eating habits. Whenever we go out to eat, she’ll comment on the menu items, suggesting healthier alternatives, or she’ll refuse to indulge in anything that isn’t “clean.” 

It’s not just about the food, though. I feel like I can't even bring up my own life updates without her turning the conversation back to her weight loss journey or her workouts. I’ve tried to be supportive and listen, but it’s exhausting. I miss the fun, carefree times we used to have.

So, a few weeks ago, I snapped. We were out at a café, and she started going on about how she’d like to cut out sugar completely. I rolled my eyes and said something like, “Maybe just enjoy your life a little instead of obsessing over every calorie.” It came out harsher than I intended, and she looked hurt. 

Since then, she’s been distant, and I feel guilty for what I said. I didn't mean to attack her progress, but I guess I was just frustrated with the constant dieting talk.

After some back and forth, I finally told her that maybe she should stop relying on me so much for emotional support and find other ways to cope. I instantly regretted saying that, but it felt like there was no way to take it back.

My friend has a dog that tends to get a bit anxious when there are a lot of people around, so I thought it would be nice to take him outside for a little while to let him calm down.

While I was outside, I noticed another friend, “Lisa,” who had been drinking a bit too much. She was sitting on the porch, and it seemed like she was getting increasingly upset about something. I approached her and asked if she was okay, and she started venting about how she felt ignored by the group and how no one was paying attention to her.

I tried to comfort her by saying that everyone was just having fun and that it wasn't personal. I even told her she could come inside and join us, but she just got more upset and started crying. At this point, I was feeling overwhelmed, so I suggested, maybe a bit too bluntly, that she could try to get some fresh air and take a breather. 

That didn’t sit well with her. She snapped back, “I don’t need your advice; I need someone to actually listen to me!” I was taken aback but tried to remain calm. I told her I was just trying to help and that I didn’t want to dismiss her feelings. 

We ended up having a heated exchange where I felt like I was defending my intentions, while she accused me of being dismissive. In the heat of the moment, I raised my voice slightly, saying, “I can’t help you if you’re not willing to talk about what’s bothering you!” 

Eventually, I walked away, thinking she just needed some space. When I returned to the gathering, I felt guilty, but I assumed she would calm down eventually.

Later that evening, I overheard other friends talking about how inappropriate our argument was. Apparently, Lisa told them about our confrontation, and a few people were saying I was a jerk for not taking her feelings seriously. I felt bad, but I also thought she could have handled it better too.

Everyone sucks here,"Last week, I was at a local coffee shop that I frequent. I always get the same drink, a caramel macchiato, and I usually enjoy it while working on my laptop. This particular day, the barista, who I recognize from previous visits, was having a rough morning. I could tell because she was moving slowly and seemed a bit short with customers.

When it was my turn to order, I noticed that they had a new promotion for a discounted pastry with any drink purchase. I ordered my usual drink and asked if I could get a pastry as well. The barista looked at me and said, “You have to order that separately; I can’t apply the discount unless you get a different drink or add it on the next transaction.” 

I was a bit frustrated since I thought it was a straightforward promotion. I pointed out that the sign didn’t make that clear and that I was a regular customer. She rolled her eyes and said, “It’s not my fault you didn’t read the sign properly.” I felt embarrassed and a bit defensive, so I snapped back, “Well, maybe you should be clearer about how your promotions work!” 

She shot me a glare but rang me up for my drink. I was still upset, so I decided to take it out on the pastries. I picked one up and said, “Guess I’ll just have to take this for free since you didn’t explain the rules.” I laughed, trying to lighten the mood, but it fell flat. She just stared at me, and I quickly put it back.

After I left, I felt guilty for both snapping at her and having that thought about the pastry. I know it wasn’t her fault that she was having a bad day, and I shouldn’t have been so rude. At the same time, I felt like she could have handled the situation a bit better too. So, AITA for how I handled that interaction?",28,842,0.76,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_20048,2023-11-01 00:00:00,ESH,1717,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Sorry for any formatting issues, I’m on mobile. 

To give some context, I’ve been friends with this group for years, and we usually have a tight-knit bond. Recently, though, things have been a bit rocky. I’ve had a lot of stress at work and have been a bit snappy with everyone. I know I haven’t been myself, which I’m trying to address, but I’m still in a tough spot.

Last weekend, we all went out for a friend’s birthday. I really wanted to have a good time and forget about my work issues for a night. When we got to the bar, I noticed one of my friends was getting a bit too drunk, and to be honest, it annoyed me. I’ve always been the responsible one in our group, and I think I was just in a mood that night.

Throughout the night, I kept making passive-aggressive comments about their drinking, things like, “Wow, you’re really going hard tonight, huh?” and “You know you’ll regret this tomorrow, right?” I didn’t think I was being that harsh, but looking back, I can see how it could come off as judgmental. 

Eventually, my friend called me out on my behavior and said I was being rude and unsupportive. Instead of owning up to it, I got defensive and said they should learn to handle their own drinking. That escalated quickly, and we ended up having a shouting match in front of the whole group. It was embarrassing for everyone, and at one point, I told them they were being immature. After that, things just got awkward, and the night ended with a lot of tension.

Now, I feel really bad about how I acted, but I also think my friend was overreacting a bit. I know I can be a bit blunt, but I didn’t mean to ruin the night. So I’m stuck wondering if I’m the asshole for trying to look out for my friend or if we both messed up.

Everyone sucks here,"I live in a shared house with three other friends, and we have a rotating chore schedule to keep things clean. I usually handle the kitchen because I enjoy cooking and baking, but I also take care of the dishes, which I don't mind most of the time.

Last week, one of my roommates, Alex, had a small gathering. I wasn't home during the party, but I came back afterward to a mess in the kitchen. There were dirty dishes piled high, a few crumbs on the counter, and some spilled drinks on the floor. I was pretty frustrated since it was my day to clean, and it felt unfair that I had to deal with the aftermath of the party.

The next day, I decided not to clean up right away. I left the mess for a few days while I thought about how to approach Alex. When I finally confronted him, I was angry and pointed out that he should have cleaned up after his guests. He got defensive and said he thought I would just take care of it like I always do, and that it wasn’t a big deal since the mess would eventually be cleaned up.

In a moment of irritation, I told him he was being irresponsible and that the least he could do was help out rather than just expecting me to always pick up after everyone. He replied that I was overreacting and that I was being a “control freak” about the chores.

In the end, we both ended up in a shouting match, and the atmosphere in the house became really tense for a few days. Now I’m just feeling bad about how I handled it, and I know I could have approached it in a calmer way instead of letting my frustration get the best of me.

As the night went on, I noticed that the host was stressed out trying to manage everything—serving snacks, drinks, and keeping the music going. I offered to help out by mixing some cocktails for the guests since I enjoy making drinks.

While I was mixing drinks, I accidentally spilled some juice on the counter. I quickly wiped it up with a towel, but in my eagerness to help, I knocked over a tray of appetizers that the host had prepared. The tray fell to the floor, and a few guests ended up stepping on some of the food, making a bit of a mess.

The host was clearly frustrated and asked me to be more careful, and I felt embarrassed. Instead of apologizing right away, I snapped back that accidents happen and that I was just trying to help. This led to a bit of a heated exchange where both of us raised our voices, and I ended up saying some things I didn't mean.

Later, I did apologize for the mess and offered to clean it up, but the mood of the party had shifted, and I could tell that my actions had affected the atmosphere. I felt like I was just trying to contribute, but I also recognized that my response to the host's frustration was out of line.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I’m a part of a local community theater group, and I’ve been involved for a couple of years now. I love acting and being part of the creative process, and I’ve made some great friends through the group. 

Recently, we were producing a new play, and I found out that one of my friends, let’s call her Sarah, was also auditioning for a lead role. Sarah and I have always been supportive of each other, but there’s been a bit of tension lately because she’s been getting more recognition than I have, and I think it’s really been bothering me. 

When the cast list was posted, I was disappointed to see that Sarah was cast in the lead role I wanted, and I was given a smaller part. I tried to play it cool, but I ended up venting my frustration to some other friends in the group. I mentioned how I thought Sarah didn’t deserve the role and how I felt like I was being overlooked despite my hard work and dedication.

Word got back to Sarah about what I said, and she confronted me. Instead of apologizing, I doubled down and told her that I thought I was a better fit for the role and that I just wanted to be honest about my feelings. The conversation turned heated, and we ended up arguing and saying some hurtful things to each other.

Afterward, I felt bad for how I handled it, especially since our group is supposed to be supportive. I apologized to Sarah, but I also felt like she could have been more understanding about my feelings. My friends are now split on the issue, some thinking I overreacted and others believing that Sarah should have been more considerate of my feelings too.

Everyone sucks here,"I live in a small apartment complex where there’s a shared laundry room in the basement. Recently, I’ve been noticing that one of my neighbors, let's call her Susan, has been leaving her laundry in the machines for hours, sometimes even overnight. This has gotten really frustrating because I often have to wait for her to clear her stuff out before I can do my own laundry. 

I approached her politely a couple of times to ask if she could be more mindful about taking her laundry out on time, but she brushed me off, saying she was busy and didn’t have time to babysit her clothes. I could understand being busy, but it was becoming a recurring issue. 

So, I decided to take matters into my own hands. One day, when she left her laundry unattended for six hours, I removed her clothes from the washer and put them on top of the dryer. I thought it was a reasonable compromise, but Susan was furious when she found her laundry there. She accused me of being disrespectful and told me I had no right to touch her things. 

While I felt justified in my actions because I had communicated my frustration to her, I can see how it might have been wrong to move her stuff without her permission. But at the same time, she should have been more considerate of others. In the end, it turned into a heated argument between us, and now there’s a tense atmosphere in our building. 

I guess we’re both at fault here—she for not being considerate and me for taking her laundry out without her consent. So, ESH?",104,1929,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_16009,2021-09-22 00:00:00,ESH,1500,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My best friend and I have been inseparable since high school. We share everything, from our dreams to our fears. Recently, my friend started dating someone. He seems nice, but I’ve noticed some red flags. He can be overly possessive and has made comments that suggest he doesn’t really respect her independence.

A couple of weeks ago, my friend confided in me that she felt uncomfortable with some of his behavior, but she was also very much in love and didn't want to end things. I got worried for her sake and felt it was my responsibility to look out for her. So, I decided to do some digging. I searched his social media accounts and came across some old posts where he was quite derogatory towards women. I screenshot the posts and sent them to my friend with a note saying she should reconsider her relationship.

She was furious when she saw the screenshots. She felt that I had betrayed her trust by snooping into his past and was upset that I was trying to interfere in her relationship. I thought I was protecting her, but now I'm beginning to wonder if I overstepped. I tried to apologize, but she hasn't really spoken to me since.

On the other hand, she started to question her boyfriend and brought up what I found. He then confronted me, saying I was trying to ruin their relationship, which made me feel awful. I didn’t mean for it to escalate like this; I just wanted to make sure she wasn’t being hurt.

Recently, I reached my breaking point after I found a pile of dirty dishes that had been sitting for days. I snapped and ended up calling them lazy and inconsiderate.

In the heat of the moment, we both said some pretty hurtful things. I was frustrated and felt like I was doing all the work to keep our home nice, and they felt attacked and defensive about their habits. 

After cooling down, we did talk things over, but it was clear we both contributed to the fight and neither of us walked away feeling good about it.

My friend Jake (28) and I (27) have been close for several years. We often hang out and do things together, but lately, there's been some tension. Jake has a habit of making fun of me when I express my feelings or share personal stories, which I’ve mentioned bothers me. He usually brushes it off, claiming he’s just joking.

Last week, we went to a party, and I opened up about some struggles I’ve been having with work. Instead of being supportive, Jake made a joke about how I should just ""stop being such a baby"" and ""man up"". It felt really hurtful, especially since I was being vulnerable. 

I tried to laugh it off, but it got under my skin. So, later that night, I decided to get back at him. I started mocking some of his past mistakes, like the time he flopped at a presentation at work. I made it light-hearted at first, but then I noticed he started to look uncomfortable. Instead of stopping, I kept pushing, thinking it would show him how it feels to be on the receiving end of teasing.

Afterward, he confronted me, saying I crossed a line and that it wasn’t cool to poke fun at him, especially when he wasn’t being serious. I told him he needed to learn how it feels and that if he didn’t want to be teased, he shouldn’t dish it out. We ended up having a heated argument, and now he’s been distant with me.

My friend (18M) responded with a kind of harsh joke about how I always lose, which I thought was funny at first. But then I made a joke back about how he only wins because he practices too much and has no life. We were both laughing, but it got a bit tense when he said that maybe I should practice more if I wanted to win. I could tell he was annoyed, and instead of letting it go, I doubled down and said he was just mad because I was better than him at some games.

Things escalated, and we ended up in this back-and-forth where I was being a bit meaner than I intended. Eventually, he snapped and told me to stop being a “brat” and that he was done with my attitude. I felt bad, but I was also frustrated that he couldn’t take a joke, so I told him he was being sensitive. 

After that, a couple of our other friends tried to mediate, but I ended up storming off, feeling pretty hurt and angry.

There was this table nearby where a group of guys was being really loud and obnoxious, laughing and making crude jokes. At first, I thought it was just typical café noise, but after a while, it became too distracting.

I was feeling a bit annoyed, so I decided to quietly ask them to tone it down. I approached their table, and in a somewhat sarcastic tone, I said, ""Hey, could you guys keep it down a bit? Some of us are trying to enjoy our coffee without the concert."" They looked at me surprised, and one of them smirked and said, ""Maybe you should just get a better coffee if you can't handle a little fun!""

At this point, I was already irritated, and instead of just walking away, I decided to keep engaging. I made a comment about how it's not that hard to be respectful in a public space, and that they might want to consider that not everyone finds their jokes funny. They started to mock me, and I could feel my temper rising.

I went back to my friends, but I couldn't let it go. I started loudly talking about how rude they were and how some people just don’t know how to act in public. This caught their attention again, and they started shouting back, calling me a ""buzzkill"" and telling me to go home if I can't take a joke.

Things escalated a bit, and I ended up shouting back that they were just insecure losers trying to impress each other with their childish antics. It was embarrassing, really. My friends were cringing, and I knew I probably should have just let it go.

Eventually, the barista had to step in and ask them to calm down, and they left shortly after. I thought I might have stood up for myself, but I also felt kind of bad for making a scene.

We enjoyed the concert, but during the last act, I started to feel really guilty about leaving my bag out there. I told my friend I wanted to go back and check on it, but he was annoyed and wanted to stay. I insisted, and he reluctantly followed me outside.

Her mother passed away unexpectedly a few weeks ago, and while I understand grief affects everyone differently, I feel like Lisa has been using her loss as an excuse to avoid her responsibilities and dominate conversations.

At first, I tried to be sympathetic. I would check in on her, let her vent about her feelings, and even offered to help her with work since she seemed overwhelmed. But after a few weeks, it became clear that every interaction revolved around her grief. She would respond to casual greetings with detailed accounts of her mother's illness or how she was struggling to cope. It felt like every chat was an emotional burden, and it was exhausting for the rest of us.

Things came to a head last week during a team meeting.

Everyone sucks here,"Hi Reddit! I’m here because I need some perspective on a situation I’ve found myself in.

So, I live with three other friends in a house, and generally, we all get along really well. However, there's one thing that's become a huge source of tension lately.

I have a pretty intense workout routine that I stick to religiously. I wake up early every morning to work out in the living room because that’s the only space I have that’s big enough for the equipment I use. I try to be considerate about the noise, but I can’t really help it if weights clank and my cardio workouts get loud.

My roommates are mostly okay with it, but one of them, let’s call him Tom, has been complaining a lot lately. He says that my morning workouts are too disruptive, and it makes it hard for him to sleep in on the weekends. I totally understand where he’s coming from, but I also feel like I deserve my space and time to work out as well.

Instead of trying to find a compromise, I decided to double down and keep my routine exactly as it was. I told Tom that I’d be finishing my workouts regardless of whether it bothered him. In retaliation, he started blasting loud music from his room right as I began my workouts, which made things worse.

Everyone sucks here,"I'm not sure how to start this, but I could really use some input. Sorry for any typos, I'm on mobile.

My sister and I grew up very close, but things have changed over the last few years. We both got married around the same time, and while her husband is very successful, mine is still in school and working part-time. Because of this, I earn more than her but also take on more responsibilities at home.

Recently, my sister and her husband invited us over for dinner. I was excited to catch up, but I noticed that throughout the evening, my sister kept making comments about how busy they are and how much money they’re spending on their lifestyle. At one point, she casually mentioned how much she loved going out to eat, which hit a nerve because my husband and I rarely go out due to our budget constraints.

I tried to change the conversation, but she kept bringing it back around to her life and how stress-free it is, which just made me feel worse. After a while, I snapped and told her that not everyone can afford to live like she does and that maybe she should be a bit more mindful about her words. I immediately regretted saying it, especially since her husband looked uncomfortable too.

She got upset and said I was being rude and ungrateful, which hurt because I never meant to attack her. I apologized, but it felt like the damage was done. I left feeling guilty, but I also felt like she wasn’t being sensitive to my situation either.

Now, I'm stuck wondering if I was the jerk in this situation. I love my sister, but I don’t know how to approach her anymore without feeling like I'm being belittled. Am I the asshole for snapping at her?",231,1689,0.92,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_73400,2018-01-05 00:00:00,ESH,1659,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Title: AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding after she treated me poorly?

I (28F) recently got engaged to my fiancé (30M), and we’re in the process of planning our wedding. My sister (25F) has always had a competitive nature and tends to overshadow my achievements, even during significant life events. For instance, when I graduated college, she made it all about her recent promotion at work. When I bought a new car, she immediately shared that she just got a new luxury vehicle. 

This behavior extended to my engagement. When I announced it, instead of congratulating me, she made a sarcastic comment about how long it took me to get a ring and followed it up with how she always knew she’d get married first. I brushed it off, but it hurt. 

A few months later, I decided to hold a small engagement party and invited family and close friends. I mentioned it to my sister, and she responded with indifference, saying she might show up if she wasn’t busy with her “more important” plans. This felt dismissive, and I asked her to consider how her words affect me. Instead of understanding, she doubled down, saying I was being overly sensitive.

Fast forward to wedding planning, and I’ve made the decision not to invite her. I want my day to be about love and support, not overshadowed by her need to be in the spotlight. I told my parents about my decision, and they are upset, saying I should include her to keep the peace. They even suggested that I should overlook her behavior for the sake of family unity.

Now, I’m feeling conflicted. I don’t want to cause drama at my wedding, but I also don’t want to feel uncomfortable on what’s supposed to be one of the happiest days of my life. 

Tl;dr: My sister has been dismissive and competitive regarding my milestones, and after she brushed off my engagement, I decided not to invite her to my wedding. My parents think I should include her to avoid family conflict. Am I the asshole?",403,669,0.8,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_80143,2023-05-10 00:00:00,ESH,1949,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I recently attended a friend's birthday party, and it was supposed to be a fun evening with a small group of our close friends. The invitations clearly stated that everyone should bring their own drinks, which I thought was fair, given that we were all in our twenties and could manage that on our own.

When I arrived at the party, I noticed that one of our friends, Sarah, had brought a ton of food and snacks but no drinks for herself. As the night went on, it became clear that she wasn’t going to be sharing any of her food with anyone else, even though she had more than enough for herself. I found it a bit rude, especially when others were sharing their snacks and drinks.

At one point, I jokingly said to Sarah, ""You know, it would be nice if you shared some of that food since we all brought our own drinks."" I meant it lightheartedly, but she took it the wrong way and snapped back, ""Well, not everyone can afford to bring both food and drinks, you know!""

I felt taken aback and a little embarrassed. In the heat of the moment, I shot back, ""Maybe next time don't expect everyone else to cover for you if you're not willing to contribute!"" The conversation escalated and quickly turned into a small argument, with some other friends trying to mediate.

Afterward, I felt bad about how everything unfolded. I didn’t mean to make Sarah upset or to call her out publicly, and she eventually ended up leaving the party early because she felt hurt. But at the same time, I felt that she should have been more considerate of everyone else, given the clear instructions about bringing drinks.

Now, I’m left wondering if I was out of line for saying something, or if Sarah should have been more willing to share the food she brought. Was I the asshole for calling her out in front of everyone, or was she being inconsiderate?",2,1726,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_91415,2024-06-17 00:00:00,ESH,1831,AITA

Over the last few months, I’ve noticed that he’s been less communicative and more withdrawn. I tried to be supportive, offering to listen and help him de-stress, but he often brushed me off, saying he just needed some space. I felt neglected and unimportant, which led to me feeling frustrated. 

One day, after a particularly rough week at work for both of us, I just snapped. I called him out for being distant and not making any effort in our relationship. I told him that it felt like he was choosing work over us and that he was being selfish by not communicating. He got defensive and said I was being unsupportive and that I didn’t understand what he was going through.

In the heat of the moment, I said some hurtful things about how he always puts his job first and that he should grow up and learn to manage his stress like an adult. He ended up storming out and staying at a friend's place for the night. The next day, I felt awful about how I handled things, and I reached out to apologize, but he wasn’t ready to talk.

Now, we’re both feeling hurt and upset, and it’s been awkward between us. I know I shouldn’t have lashed out, but I also feel like he should have been more open with me about what he was feeling. It’s been tough, and I’m not sure how to move forward. AITA for my outburst, or is he also at fault for shutting me out?

We’ve been planning this for a while, and everyone was really looking forward to it. A few days ago, Sarah reached out to me, saying that she was concerned about how many people we were inviting and that she wanted to limit it to just the four of us. 

I can understand her wanting a more intimate setting, but I thought it was a bit unfair since we had already agreed to have a bigger group. I know Jake and Emma were excited to come, and I didn’t want to throw a wrench in the plans. So, I proposed a compromise: we could stick to the original plan for this trip, but I suggested that for the next trip, we could limit the numbers more.

Sarah was not happy with my response. She accused me of being selfish and not considering her feelings. I was frustrated, so I told her that it was unfair to expect me to just drop our friends like that at the last minute. I felt like she was being controlling. In hindsight, maybe I could have been more understanding, but I was really just trying to keep the group together.

That night, Jake and Emma texted me, asking what was up with Sarah. They had noticed that there was tension and wanted to check in. I vented a bit about how I felt Sarah was being unreasonable, and they both agreed that it was important to include everyone. 

The next day, Sarah found out I had discussed it with Jake and Emma. She confronted me and said that I should have kept our conversation private. I told her that I felt she was being dramatic, and that I was just trying to keep the group together. We ended up in a big argument over text, with both of us saying things we didn’t mean.

Now, I feel like I might have overstepped by talking to Jake and Emma, but I also think Sarah could have handled it better instead of trying to exclude them.

One Saturday afternoon, we were there enjoying our usual routine when a group of four or five people came in and took the table next to us. They were loud and animated, laughing and talking over each other.

At first, it was fine, but soon their volume started to drown out our conversations and the sounds of our game. I tried to ignore it, but it was getting distracting. After a while, I politely asked them if they could tone it down a bit since we were trying to enjoy our game. Instead of acknowledging my request, they laughed and got even louder.

Frustrated, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I stood up and asked them again, this time more assertively, to keep it down. They responded by making fun of me, saying things like “What are you going to do, ask us to leave?” I felt embarrassed and angry, so I snapped back that they were being inconsiderate and ruining everyone else's time.

At that point, one of my friends joined in, and we both ended up arguing with them. It turned into a back-and-forth shouting match, and it got really heated. The barista came over to intervene, telling us all to cool it down or leave. We ended up leaving, feeling like we had lost the battle.

I (28F) have a best friend, Lisa (29F), who I’ve known since childhood. We’re super close, and we usually tell each other everything. Lately, she’s been dating this guy, Mark (30M), for about six months. I’ve met him a few times, and while I think he’s okay, I can’t shake this feeling that he’s not really good for her. He seems controlling and often dismisses her opinions or ideas, but Lisa is head over heels for him.

Recently, Lisa told me she was thinking about moving in with him. I panicked because I genuinely believe she’s rushing into things and might end up unhappy if she does. So, I decided to intervene. I had a conversation with her where I pointed out some of the red flags I’ve noticed about Mark, emphasizing how I just want her to be happy and make informed choices. 

Instead of being grateful for my concern, she got really upset and accused me of trying to sabotage her relationship. In hindsight, I realize I might have been too harsh in my delivery and possibly overstepped my bounds as a friend. I was really just trying to protect her.

Feeling guilty, I ended up telling Mark that I was worried about Lisa and how I thought he wasn’t treating her well. Of course, that backfired. Mark confronted Lisa about it, and she was furious at me for going behind her back. Now she’s distancing herself from me, saying I broke her trust.

I feel bad for the way things turned out, but I also believe I was trying to do the right thing. I just wanted to ensure my friend was making the right choice.

However, my cousin Jake has a unique sense of humor that can often border on offensive.

During the party, he made a joke at the expense of my aunt’s recent weight loss journey, which left her visibly upset. The atmosphere shifted, and I could tell people were uncomfortable. Instead of addressing it directly, I decided to try to lighten the mood and jokingly said, “Wow, Jake, you’re really killing it with the ‘personal attacks’ today!” I thought it was a clever way to call him out without creating too much tension.

However, my comment didn't go over as well as I’d hoped. Jake shot back, saying, “At least I’m not the one using my aunt’s struggles for my ‘comedy routines.’” My comment did make him back off for a moment, but it only escalated the situation. 

After that, we went back and forth a bit, and it became clear that neither of us was willing to let it go. A few other family members chimed in, and soon it turned into a full-blown argument.

We had a family meeting where we talked about balancing screen time with responsibilities. I thought we had reached an understanding, but it didn’t improve much. 

Last week, I noticed that Jake didn’t do any of his chores again, so I decided to take a different approach. I took his gaming console and put it in my room, telling him he could have it back only after he completed his chores for the week. I thought this would motivate him, but it backfired. He got furious and stormed off, saying I was being a jerk.

Sarah was furious with me too. She told me I had no right to take his things like that since I'm not his parent. I argued that I was just trying to help him be responsible, but she thought I went too far. She ended up giving him his console back, which felt like a betrayal to me.

In retaliation, when Jake asked me to help him with his math homework the next day, I said no. I told him he needed to learn to handle his responsibilities before asking for help. He got upset and called me a bad brother-in-law.

My neighbor, however, has a large dog that he lets run loose in the yard, and I'm worried about my kids getting bitten. I decided to put up a small fence between our properties to create a barrier. I didn’t talk to him about it first because I thought it would be a good idea and that he would understand.

When he found out, he was furious. He said I was being rude and that it was his property too, and he didn't appreciate me making decisions without consulting him. In my defense, I argued that I was just trying to keep my kids safe and that he could still use his yard. But he’s been really upset and has now started letting his dog run in my yard too as a form of protest.

I feel justified for wanting to protect my kids, but I also realize I didn’t handle the situation well by not discussing it with him first. Now we’re both angry, and the kids are caught in the middle. AITA?",70,1791,0.59,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_88334,2018-06-04 00:00:00,ESH,1038,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Hello,

I’m reaching out because I’m a bit torn about a recent family argument that ended with hurt feelings on both sides. 

Here’s the situation: My sister-in-law, Lucy, recently got engaged and asked me to be her maid of honor. I was thrilled and excited to support her big day. However, she made it clear that she wanted a very traditional wedding, including a large bridal party and specific roles for everyone. This included her best friend, who was a little disorganized and hasn't been the most supportive in the past.

When it came time to plan the bridal shower, Lucy asked me to take the lead since she knew I had experience in organizing events. I was happy to help, but I was also frustrated by her insistence on inviting almost everyone she knew, which would make planning difficult and expensive. I suggested we keep it smaller and focus on close friends and family to make it more personal and manageable.

Lucy didn't take this well. She accused me of trying to undermine her vision for the bridal shower and wedding. In the heat of the moment, I snapped and pointed out that her best friend probably wouldn’t even show up to the shower because she has a history of bailing on plans. I was honestly just trying to help, but I can see how my comment hurt Lucy, who really values her friendship with this person.

Now, Lucy is upset with me for criticizing her friend, and I feel guilty for losing my temper and not being more understanding of her wishes. I believe we both contributed to the argument.

Everyone sucks here,"My friend Sarah has always been a bit of a control freak. She likes to plan every detail of our trips, which can be exhausting, but I usually go along with it because I want to keep the peace. Recently, we planned a weekend getaway to the beach with a few other friends. 

The plan was for all of us to drive together, but when the day came, Sarah insisted on leaving earlier than everyone else because she wanted to get a good spot on the beach. I felt bad for my other friends, who are often late, so I suggested we wait just a little longer. Sarah snapped at me, saying I was ruining her plans, and it turned into a heated argument. 

In frustration, I told her that if she wanted to go alone, she should just go. I didn’t mean it seriously, but she took it to heart and ended up leaving without us. I felt bad afterward, especially since I didn’t want to ruin the trip for everyone else, but I also felt like I was just standing up to her controlling nature.

When we finally arrived at the beach later, Sarah was already set up and sulking by herself. I tried to talk to her, but she ignored me. I ended up spending most of the day with our other friends, and I could tell Sarah was upset and felt alienated.

Later that evening, I confronted her about her attitude, and we both ended up yelling at each other. It got pretty messy, and I ended up saying some hurtful things about her being too uptight and ruining the fun for everyone. We both left the trip feeling resentful.

Everyone sucks here,"Throwaway account because my friends know my main one.

So, here's the situation. My sister and I have always had a rocky relationship, but things really hit a breaking point last year. We both have kids, and we used to have regular family get-togethers. However, right before the holidays, she made a big deal about how we needed to stop bringing our kids to family events unless they were ""well-behaved."" This came after my toddler had a typical meltdown at a gathering, and she basically said she couldn’t stand ""loud, unruly children"" and implied that my parenting was lacking.

I was furious, of course. I confronted her about it, and we ended up in a shouting match. I told her that being a parent is hard, and she should be more understanding. She shot back that she didn’t want her kids exposed to ""chaos."" It got personal, and I ended up saying some hurtful things about her parenting as well, which I regret.

Fast forward a few months, and we ended up not talking at all over the holidays. I tried to reach out to make amends, but she ignored my messages. Eventually, she invited me to her kid’s birthday party but only if I left my kids at home. I felt completely unwelcome and decided to skip it. Instead, I took my kids to a nearby park to celebrate their own little birthday since they felt left out.

At the party, I posted pictures on social media of my kids having fun, and she saw it. She blew up my phone, calling me selfish and saying I was sabotaging her party by showing off my kids. I told her that I didn’t intend to ruin her day; I just wanted my kids to enjoy themselves. We ended up getting into another argument, and once again, I said some things I shouldn’t have.

Now, our family is divided. My parents think I should apologize to her, but I feel like she was the one who started all this by being so judgmental. I know I didn't handle things perfectly either, but I genuinely feel hurt by her actions. 

So, am I the asshole for feeling this way and not wanting to apologize?",481,866,0.57,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_29489,2022-11-10 00:00:00,ESH,2008,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My sister has been struggling with infertility for several years, and it's been really tough for her. She's been very open about her feelings and has often expressed her desire to adopt if she can't have biological children. I totally support her and have tried to be there for her as much as I can. 

Recently, I found out I was pregnant. I was overjoyed but also anxious about how my sister would react. When I told her, she seemed happy on the surface, but I could tell she was hurt. Later, she expressed that she felt like I was “rubbing it in her face” and that my pregnancy was a constant reminder of what she couldn’t have. I didn’t mean to hurt her; I just wanted to share my news.

In an attempt to make her feel better, I suggested that we could talk about the possibility of adopting together when the time came for me to have kids. I thought it would be a way for us to bond and perhaps even help her process her feelings about infertility. Instead, she got really upset and accused me of trying to turn her pain into a competition. I told her I wasn’t trying to make it a competition at all, but rather wanted to support her in any way I could.

Things escalated, and we ended up in a heated argument. I told her it was unfair to project her feelings onto me, and she countered that I was being insensitive by not fully understanding her pain.

Everyone sucks here,"My brother, who’s 30, recently got engaged to his girlfriend of two years. I’ve met her a few times, and while I wouldn’t say we’re close, I think she’s nice enough. The engagement happened pretty quickly, and to be honest, I was a bit surprised, but who am I to judge someone else's relationship?

A few weeks ago, I found out from my mom that my brother's fiancée had been married before, and that her ex-husband had cheated on her, which was part of why their marriage fell apart. My mom emphasized how my brother should be cautious because she claimed that some people never truly heal from past relationships and can carry baggage into new ones.

I decided to bring this up with my brother because I genuinely care about him and want him to be happy. I approached him in what I thought was a supportive way, mentioning that I had heard about her past and that he should just be aware of it. I thought it was better to be open than to hide my concerns.

My brother was furious. He accused me of trying to sabotage his relationship and said that I had no right to judge his fiancée based on her past. He told me that she had been open with him about her previous marriage, and he didn’t see it as baggage but rather as part of her story. He was upset that I had even brought it up and said that I was ruining his happiness.

I felt terrible because that was never my intention. I just wanted to be a good brother. But at the same time, I was frustrated that he couldn’t see where I was coming from. I think I may have overstepped, but I also feel like I was just trying to protect him.

Everyone sucks here,"I need some perspective on a situation that recently happened with my friends. 

So, my group of friends and I have a tradition of hosting a big dinner every month where we take turns cooking. It’s a fun way to catch up, and we all look forward to it. This month, it was my turn to host, and I decided to whip up a big batch of my famous lasagna. I put a lot of time and effort into making it, and I was really excited to share it with everyone.

A couple of days before the dinner, one of my friends, Jake, mentioned that he was trying out a new diet and wouldn’t be able to eat my lasagna. I jokingly offered to make a salad or something on the side, but he insisted that he’d just skip the dinner altogether if I didn’t have something that fit his diet. This annoyed me a bit, as it felt like he was making it all about him, but I didn’t want to cause any drama, so I said I’d try to accommodate him.

On the day of the dinner, I went all out and made enough food for everyone. When Jake arrived, he immediately started complaining about how he was starving and that there wasn’t anything he could eat. I felt frustrated because I had done my best to include him, but it was impossible to please everyone. Instead of talking it out, I snapped at him and said if he was that concerned, he should have brought his own food or just eaten beforehand. 

He got defensive and said I was being inconsiderate for not catering to his dietary choices. The tension escalated, and eventually, we ended up in a heated argument in front of the whole group. Everyone was uncomfortable, and the evening just turned awkward.

Afterwards, I felt bad for how things turned out, and I know I could have handled it better. But I also think Jake could have been more understanding. So, AITA for snapping at Jake during the dinner, or was he being unreasonable about the food situation? I feel like we both overreacted.

Everyone sucks here,"So a few weeks ago, I was at a local coffee shop with my best friend, Jake. We both work full-time and don’t get to hang out as much as we’d like, so this was kind of a big deal for us. While we were there, I noticed a girl sitting alone at a table nearby, looking a bit sad. I recognized her as someone from our community college, where I had taken a few classes.

I thought it would be nice to invite her over to join us, thinking it might cheer her up and that she could use some company. I approached her and asked if she wanted to come sit with us. She smiled and agreed, and I introduced her to Jake. Her name was Lily, and it turned out she was having a rough week due to some family issues.

As we talked, Jake and I tried to include her in the conversation, offering support and trying to lighten the mood. However, as the conversation went on, I noticed that Jake was getting increasingly annoyed. He kept giving me these looks like he wanted me to just carry on with our original plan—just the two of us.

Eventually, Jake just sort of snapped and said, “Hey, can we just have some time alone? We were here first.” It caught me off guard, and I felt really embarrassed. I didn’t want to be rude to Lily, but I also didn’t want to upset my best friend. I told Jake that it wasn’t like we were on a time limit and that it was okay to include her, but he insisted that we needed to focus on our time together.

Feeling torn, I ended up telling Lily that I was really sorry, but we needed to go back to our original plan. She looked hurt, and I felt awful for putting her in that position. She left quietly, and I could tell she was upset. After she left, Jake and I got into a bit of an argument. He said I was too nice and that I needed to prioritize our friendship over trying to be a good Samaritan with strangers. I was frustrated because I felt like I was trying to help someone who needed it, but I also didn’t want to lose Jake's friendship.

So, in the end, we both kind of acted like jerks. I felt bad for how things turned out with Lily, but Jake was adamant that I should have prioritized him.

He has a tendency to dominate conversations and often turns everything into a joke, even when it might not be the right time.

Last weekend, we were all at a birthday party for one of our friends, and Jake started making jokes about the birthday person, who was feeling a bit down about turning a year older. I thought it was really inappropriate, but I tried to let it slide since it was a party and I knew he just wanted to lighten the mood.

At some point, after a couple of particularly cringy jokes about getting old, I finally snapped and said, “Maybe if you weren’t so desperate for attention, you’d notice that not everyone wants to hear your jokes.” It got really quiet, and Jake looked hurt. He said something about me being uptight and that it was just humor, but I stood my ground, insisting that there’s a time and a place.

Everyone sucks here,"This is my first time posting here, so I hope I explain things clearly. I’m on mobile, so bear with me on any mistakes. TLDR at the bottom.

I (28F) have a close group of friends that I’ve known since college. We often hang out and do things together, but over the past year, I’ve started to feel like one of my friends, Sarah (27F), has been a little controlling. For context, Sarah has a very strong personality and often takes charge when we plan outings or trips. 

A few months ago, we decided to plan a weekend getaway. Sarah took the lead on organizing everything, which I appreciated at first. However, when it came to picking accommodations, she insisted we stay at a place that she found without consulting the rest of us. When I finally saw the place, I didn’t like it at all—it was way out of my budget and not at all what I wanted for a relaxing weekend. I brought this up to the group chat, hoping for a discussion, but Sarah quickly dismissed my concerns and said she had already booked it, so it was too late to change anything.

Feeling frustrated, I vented to another friend, Mike (29M), who agreed with me that we should have had a vote on the accommodations. I didn’t name names, but I may have made some sarcastic remarks about Sarah’s “always in charge” attitude. 

When Sarah found out about my conversation with Mike, she was hurt and confronted me. She accused me of undermining her and trying to pit our friends against her. I felt bad because I didn’t mean for her to find out, but I also felt justified in my frustration about how things were handled.

Now, I’m debating whether I should apologize to Sarah for venting or if I should stand my ground and explain I was just expressing my feelings. I don’t want to lose a friend, but I also feel like I was pushed into a corner.

She’s super organized, got great grades, and has already received early acceptance to a school she loves. Lately, she’s been trying to help everyone out with their applications, which I initially thought was nice.

But last week, during one of our study sessions at my house, Jake was really struggling with his personal statement. He kept asking for help, and Mia kept jumping in with her ideas. I could tell he was getting more and more frustrated because he wasn’t looking for a complete overhaul of his work, just some support and encouragement. 

At one point, Mia suggested he completely change his topic, and that’s when he snapped. He told her that she wasn't the one applying to his school and that her advice felt more like criticism. I could see Mia was hurt and I didn't want the situation to escalate, but in a moment of frustration, I blurted out, “Mia, can you just stop? Not everyone has to be perfect like you.

Everyone sucks here,"I grew up in a very competitive family, where achievements were constantly compared and praised. My brother, Jake, was always the ""golden child"" – he excelled in sports, academics, and pretty much everything he did. I’ve always felt like I was in his shadow, trying to carve out my own identity but often feeling overshadowed by his accomplishments.

Recently, Jake won a state championship in soccer, and the whole family was ecstatic. I tried to be supportive, but it stung a bit given that I had just been cut from the school play after auditioning for the lead. During a family gathering to celebrate Jake’s win, everyone was sharing stories and excitement about his future in soccer. At some point, someone asked me about my audition, and I jokingly said, “Well, at least I won’t have to worry about being overshadowed by another ‘star’ on the field!” 

I thought it was a light-hearted jab, but Jake took it personally. He shot back, saying something like, “Well, maybe if you weren’t so focused on trying to be different, you’d actually succeed at something instead of just being a loser.” The atmosphere immediately shifted, and everyone was quiet. I snapped back, telling him that he wouldn’t know what it’s like to fail because he never tried anything he wasn’t sure he could win.

That turned into a full-blown argument, with both of us yelling and saying hurtful things. I called him a “one-trick pony” and said he was only good at soccer because he didn’t have the guts to try anything else, while he accused me of being jealous and bitter. It got so heated that my parents had to intervene and separate us.

I feel bad about how it escalated, but I also think Jake has a habit of putting others down to elevate himself. I never meant to hurt him, but it felt like I had to stand up for myself after all the years of feeling inferior.

Instead of letting it go, I pushed it further by saying that everyone should just try to have a little fun and not take things so seriously, which only seemed to irritate her more.

After dinner, when we were around the campfire, the vibe was off. Sarah was quiet and distant, and I could tell she was annoyed. I tried to apologize for the joke, saying I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings, but she just shrugged it off and wouldn’t engage in conversation.

After that, she was upset, and our parents got involved, trying to mediate. They said I should step up and be more supportive, but I felt justified in standing my ground. In the end, I didn’t go to the wedding, and my sister was heartbroken. 

Now there’s a rift between all of us, and it feels like everyone is taking sides. I wonder if I overreacted, but I also feel like my sister was being unreasonable.

Everyone sucks here,"My sister and I have always had a rocky relationship, but recently, things have gotten even worse. She just got engaged, and while I was genuinely happy for her, I couldn't help but notice how she seemed to completely disregard my own engagement that happened a few months prior. I wanted to celebrate my engagement with her, but she brushed it off and focused all her energy on her wedding planning.

Feeling hurt, I made a comment during a family dinner about how it was nice to finally be engaged and that I hoped she wouldn't forget about my special day when planning hers. My sister snapped back, saying I was just trying to steal her thunder. In the heat of the moment, I shot back that maybe if she spent less time worrying about her wedding and more time acknowledging my life changes, I wouldn’t feel the need to compete for attention.

Afterward, I felt bad for saying that because I do want to support her, but it also felt like I was always sidelined in her life. We both ended up arguing more, and now there’s tension between us that’s making family gatherings awkward.

Everyone sucks here,"I’m posting on behalf of my friend, Alex, who’s been feeling conflicted about a situation involving their roommate, Sam. Alex and Sam have lived together for about a year and generally get along well, but some unresolved issues have recently come to a head.

Alex is a bit of a neat freak, while Sam is more laid-back about cleanliness. Over time, Alex has expressed concerns about Sam’s tendency to leave dirty dishes in the sink for days, and it’s been a source of frustration for Alex. They’ve had several discussions about it, with Alex suggesting a chore chart or a cleaning schedule to help keep things tidy. Sam, however, has brushed it off, claiming they’re just busy and don’t see it as a big deal.

Last week, things escalated when Alex returned home to find the living room in complete disarray. Sam had hosted a small gathering without telling Alex, and the aftermath was overwhelming—empty soda cans, pizza boxes, and leftover food everywhere. Alex was furious and confronted Sam, expressing that this was unacceptable and a blatant disregard for their shared space.

In the heat of the moment, Alex ended up shouting and calling Sam inconsiderate, which led to a heated argument where Sam accused Alex of being uptight and controlling. Both of them said hurtful things, and it ended with Sam retreating to their room and Alex feeling guilty for losing their temper.

Alex now feels bad about how they handled the situation, but they also feel that Sam should take responsibility for their mess and lack of communication. They’re contemplating whether they were in the wrong for getting so angry, but at the same time, they feel justified in wanting a clean living space.

So, are they both the assholes in this situation?",702,2112,0.52,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_10070,2024-04-20 00:00:00,ESH,1735,AITA

During the evening, my friends started playing some loud music, and despite my attempts to keep the volume in check, it ended up getting a bit out of hand.

My roommate came out of her room clearly frustrated and told us to turn it down, which I did immediately. However, I was annoyed that she didn’t mention anything about the music before, and I felt like I was walking on eggshells in my own home.

She got really upset and said I was being inconsiderate, and that she felt like she couldn't enjoy her own space.

Everyone sucks here,"I have a pretty close-knit friend group, and we often hang out together at each other's houses. We usually rotate who hosts, and everyone pitches in for snacks and drinks. However, there's one friend, let’s call him Mike, who has a habit of taking it a step too far when it comes to eating and drinking at our get-togethers.

Mike frequently shows up with a huge appetite and can make a meal out of the snacks we offer. I don’t mind sharing, but he has a tendency to eat a lot more than anyone else and often finishes off whatever snacks we’ve prepared. It has become a running joke that he’s the “snack monster,” but it’s starting to become a problem. When he comes over, he usually wipes out the entire platter of chips or the whole pizza, leaving little for everyone else.

Last week, I hosted a game night and prepared a bunch of appetizers, thinking it would be enough for everyone. As predicted, Mike arrived and practically inhaled the food. I made a light-hearted comment about him being a “snack vacuum,” but he just laughed and kept eating. By the end of the night, there was hardly anything left for the rest of us, and I felt embarrassed having to offer my friends only a few leftover chips.

Afterward, I decided to say something to Mike. I told him that while I appreciate his enthusiasm for food, it might be good etiquette to show some restraint so everyone can enjoy the snacks. He took it poorly and said I was being overly dramatic and that I shouldn't take it so seriously.

Feeling frustrated, I snapped back, saying he needed to stop being so greedy and think about the group. It turned into a bit of an argument, and now he’s upset with me, saying I’m calling him out in front of everyone. I feel bad that it escalated like this, but I do think he needs to realize how his actions affect others.

So, Reddit, AITA for calling out Mike's eating habits at our game night?",917,1828,0.7,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_14599,2022-02-26 00:00:00,ESH,1892,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, a bit of background: I live with my roommate, Alex, and we’ve been friends for a while. We have different schedules; I’m usually out late at work while Alex works from home. Recently, Alex adopted a cat named Whiskers, and while I think it’s great, I didn’t realize how much responsibility it would add to our household.

About a week ago, I came home late from work after a really exhausting shift. I had planned to just eat something quick and crash. When I walked in, Whiskers was running around like crazy, and Alex was trying to catch him. Apparently, Whiskers had jumped on top of a shelf and knocked down a few picture frames, and Alex was freaking out about it.

Instead of helping Alex, I just snapped, saying something like, ""Can’t you control your cat? I’m too tired for this!"" Alex looked hurt, and I could see they were stressed out. In that moment, I just wanted peace and quiet after a long day. I should have realized how overwhelming it must be to train a new pet.

After some more chaos, I decided to go to my room to avoid the situation entirely. I thought maybe a little distance would help calm things down. But when I came out a couple of hours later, Alex was still visibly upset. They confronted me about leaving them to handle it alone, and we ended up having a heated argument. I told them it wasn’t my fault they chose to get a pet, and they accused me of being unsupportive and selfish.

In hindsight, I realize both of us were at fault. I shouldn’t have reacted the way I did, but I also think Alex could have communicated their needs better instead of just exploding when things went wrong. Now there’s this tension in our apartment, and I’m not sure how to fix it.

Everyone sucks here,"TLDR: My friend constantly criticizes my taste in music, saying it's too basic and that I should explore more. I finally snapped back, saying she should stick to her ""pretentious"" tastes if she thinks mine are so bad. AITA?

I’ve always been a fan of mainstream pop music. It's what I grew up with, and I find it catchy and fun. Recently, I've been going out with a group of friends who are more into indie and alternative music. One of them, let's call her L, seems to take it upon herself to critique my music choices every time we hang out.

At first, I thought it was light-hearted banter, but it quickly turned into a pattern. Anytime a popular song comes on, L rolls her eyes and says things like, “You really listen to this basic stuff?” or “You should try listening to something deeper.” I’ve tried to explain to her that I just enjoy what I enjoy and that there’s nothing wrong with liking popular music. I even told her that I appreciate her recommendations but that I don’t always vibe with them.

L just wouldn’t let up. She would go on rants about how mainstream music lacks substance and how I’m missing out by not exploring more. It got to the point where I started to feel self-conscious about my music preferences whenever we were in a group setting.

Last week, while we were hanging out and “Shake It Off” came on, I could see the familiar eye roll from L. I’d had enough. I snapped and said, “You know what, if you think my taste in music is so terrible, maybe you should just stick to your pretentious indie bands and let me enjoy my tunes in peace.” 

After saying that, I felt bad. I don’t want to hurt L’s feelings, but I was just so frustrated with her constant criticism.

Everyone sucks here,"This happened a few days ago. I was at a friend's birthday party, and things got a bit out of hand. I was having a few drinks and started feeling pretty confident, maybe too confident. I’ve always had a playful sense of humor, but sometimes it doesn’t land well.

At the party, there was a guy there named Tom who I knew pretty well. He’s the kind of guy who's always making jokes but can sometimes come off as a bit obnoxious. He was making fun of people and telling some cringeworthy jokes. I decided to join in on the fun and tease him back. 

I made what I thought was a light-hearted comment about him always being the ""life of the party"" but in a sarcastic way. I said something like, ""Yeah, Tom, we all love your terrible jokes. Really makes the party fun!"" A few people laughed, but I could see Tom’s face drop a bit. I thought he was just playing along with the roast.

As the night went on, I kept poking fun at him every now and then, not realizing that he was getting more and more uncomfortable. A couple of his friends even told me to back off, but I was too caught up in the moment to really listen. I thought I was being funny and that everyone was enjoying it.

Eventually, Tom snapped. He called me out, saying I was being a bully and that he was just trying to have a good time. I felt my face flush; I didn’t mean to hurt his feelings. 

I tried to apologize, but I ended up getting defensive, insisting that I was just joking and that he needed to lighten up. The tension in the room was palpable, and I could tell that some people were uncomfortable, including a few of my friends who had been laughing along at first.

After a while, Tom walked away, clearly upset, and I felt terrible. I realized I had crossed a line and that my “jokes” weren’t as harmless as I thought. I texted him later to apologize, but I’m not sure if it was enough. 

I feel like I was trying to be funny, but I also see now that I overstepped. So, I’m not sure if I’m the asshole or if he was too sensitive. I just know that the night ended awkwardly for everyone.",831,1847,0.94,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_36686,2021-11-25 00:00:00,ESH,2063,AITA

Recently, I got a new job that I'm really excited about, but it's a bit of a step up from my previous position. I've been working hard to prove myself, and I've been sharing my experiences and accomplishments with my friends, including Mike.

Last week, we were at a friend's birthday party, and I was talking about a recent project I completed at work. I was feeling proud and wanted to share my excitement. Instead of being supportive, Mike interrupted me and made a snarky comment about how I was just ""tooting my own horn."" It really threw me off, but I brushed it off at the moment and tried to continue my story.

At this point, I felt humiliated and called him out in front of everyone, telling him it was rude to undermine my efforts and feelings. 

After the party, Mike texted me saying that I overreacted and that he was just joking. I told him that while I appreciated his sense of humor, it felt like he was dismissing my hard work and that I didn't find it funny. He then accused me of being too sensitive and said I needed to lighten up.

Everyone sucks here,"I need some perspective on a situation I’m in and I figured this subreddit might help. I’ve created a throwaway account for this. 

So, I (30M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (28F) for about two years now. We both work, but I have a higher-paying job in tech while she works part-time as a barista. We live together and share expenses, but I definitely contribute more financially. A few months ago, we decided to start saving for a vacation together, and I was really looking forward to it.

Things started to go sideways when my girlfriend expressed that she wanted to invite her younger sister (20F) to come along on our trip. I didn't think it was a good idea, primarily because we had already planned this trip as a couple’s getaway and it would significantly increase our expenses. I voiced my concerns, thinking it would be awkward and more complicated. However, my girlfriend insisted that her sister could really use a break and didn’t have the funds to travel on her own.

After some back-and-forth, I reluctantly agreed to let her sister join, but I made it clear that I wouldn't be able to cover her sister's expenses. My girlfriend said she would handle that, which meant she had to take a bit more from our vacation budget to cover her sister's share. I felt a little frustrated because I wanted to enjoy this trip just with her, but I also didn’t want to be the bad guy.

Fast forward to now: we are a few weeks away from the trip, and my girlfriend has been stressing about her sister’s involvement. She’s worried about how to make it all work financially, especially since her sister doesn’t have much money. I suggested we renegotiate the plan and let her sister know she couldn’t come, but my girlfriend blew up at me, saying I was being selfish and unsupportive. 

I tried to explain that I just wanted to keep our vacation special, but I admit I wasn’t very empathetic to her feeling of wanting to help her sister. I was focused on my feelings rather than seeing things from her perspective. So now I’m feeling guilty, but at the same time, I don’t want to be stuck paying for someone else’s vacation.

In the end, we both said some harsh things during our argument, and I realize we’ve both been a bit unreasonable. I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for wanting to keep our trip to just the two of us, or if she’s the asshole for wanting to bring her sister along and putting that pressure on me. 

TL;DR: My girlfriend wants to bring her sister on our planned vacation, which I don’t agree with. We argued about it and both said hurtful things. Am I the asshole for wanting this trip to be just for us?

I believe it's important for him to have limits on how much time he spends on screens, especially video games, while my partner thinks he should be allowed more freedom to explore and play without restrictions.

One weekend, my partner went out with friends and left our son with me. I decided to stick to our agreed-upon screen time limits and told our son he could only play for an hour. He threw a huge tantrum, saying his friends get to play as much as they want and that I was being unfair. I stood my ground, but I felt guilty watching him cry about it.

In frustration, I called my partner to vent. When I told him about the tantrum, he said I was being too strict and that I should just let our son enjoy his time. This upset me because I felt like he was undermining my authority as a parent. In retaliation, I decided to limit our son's screen time even further, saying he could only play on weekends and not during the week at all.

Feeling frustrated, I tried to steer the conversation back to my accomplishment. I thought it would be a moment for me to shine a little and celebrate my success. Instead, my brother kept cutting me off and bragging about his work, which really started to get under my skin.

I (30F) have been living with my boyfriend (32M) for about a year. He has a 10-year-old daughter from a previous relationship that he shares custody of. I don’t have kids of my own, but I love his daughter and we’ve been building a nice little family together. 

However, there’s been some tension lately regarding finances. I work a decent job and make a good salary, while my boyfriend is currently between jobs and has been for a few months. He does receive some child support, but it doesn’t cover all his expenses, and he seems to be relying on me more than I expected. I’ve been paying for most of the household bills, groceries, and even some of his daughter’s expenses, which I initially didn’t mind. But I’ve been feeling increasingly resentful about it.

A few months ago, we had a conversation about budgeting and how his financial situation was affecting us. I suggested that he take on a part-time job or look for something more stable, but he seemed resistant, saying he wants to focus on being a good dad and that he’ll find something soon. I get that, but it feels like he’s prioritizing that over our financial stability.

Last week, we had friends over for dinner, and I offered to cook. I made enough food for everyone, but my boyfriend insisted on ordering takeout instead because he didn’t want to “burden me” with extra dishes. I was frustrated because I felt like I was already carrying a heavy load financially, and this felt like a waste of money. During dinner, it came out that he had secretly ordered the takeout anyway and didn’t tell me until it arrived. I lost it a bit and called him irresponsible for spending money we didn’t have. 

He got defensive, saying he was trying to provide a nice experience for our friends and that I was being overly harsh. I ended up snapping and saying that if he couldn’t pull his weight, he shouldn’t be making decisions about our finances. It turned into a huge argument, and we both said some hurtful things.

Things escalated when he reluctantly joined us but kept looking at his phone, clearly distracted. I snapped at him to put his phone down and be present, which turned into a full-blown argument. He called me controlling, and I told him that he doesn't respect family time. 

Lily, in an effort to defend her brother, jumped in and said I was being unfair and that I should just let Jake be himself. In frustration, I told her to stop taking sides and that as a parent, I needed to set boundaries. My husband tried to mediate, but I was too upset and ended up yelling that I was just trying to create a family moment and that they were ruining it.

Afterwards, Jake went to his room and remained upset, and Lily stopped speaking to me. I felt bad for how it all unfolded, but I also think Jake should learn the value of family time. Now, I’m left wondering if I overreacted or if I was right to want my son to participate.

Everyone sucks here,"I'm a 17-year-old guy, and I have a younger sister named Lily who is 14. Our parents are really strict about our grades and how we behave at home. Recently, they decided to introduce a new rule: we both have to do our homework in the living room, so they can supervise us and ensure we’re not slacking off. 

Lily is a bright kid, but she has a tendency to get distracted easily. Whenever we sit down to do homework, she ends up playing with her phone or watching TV instead of focusing. I’ve been trying to help her stay on track, but it’s really frustrating when she keeps getting sidetracked.

Last week, I was trying to work on a tough math assignment when Lily started playing music really loudly from her phone. I snapped at her, telling her to turn it down because I couldn’t concentrate. She rolled her eyes and told me to lighten up, which just made me angrier. 

In a moment of frustration, I said something pretty harsh: ""You’re such a dumbass. If you focused even half as much on school as you do on your phone, you wouldn’t be failing your classes."" Immediately, I felt guilty. I knew I shouldn’t have stooped that low, especially since I’ve had my own struggles with school.

Lily started crying and went to tell our parents. They came in and scolded me for being mean to her, which I deserved. I tried to explain that I was just frustrated with her lack of focus, but my parents grounded me for a week and told me I needed to be more supportive.

Now I feel bad for what I said, but at the same time, I think I was justified in being upset about her distractions. We both messed up here—she shouldn’t have ignored me, and I shouldn’t have called her names.

Everyone sucks here,"Title: ""AITA for not telling my friend that her boyfriend is cheating on her?""

So, here’s the situation. I have a close friend, Sarah, who has been dating Jake for about a year. I really like Jake; he's charming, funny, and seems to treat her well. The problem is that a few weeks ago, I saw him out with another woman at a local bar, getting pretty cozy. They were holding hands and laughing, and it definitely seemed like they were more than just friends. 

I thought about telling Sarah, but I hesitated. I know how much she loves Jake and how excited she is about their relationship. I didn't want to ruin things for her without solid proof. So, I kept quiet and tried to forget about it.

Then last weekend, I was having a small get-together at my place, and guess who shows up? Yup, Jake. He walks in with Sarah, and I can’t shake off the feeling of unease. During the party, he was acting all sweet to her, but I couldn't help but glance over at him and that other woman, who I later found out is his coworker. That’s when I realized that I wasn’t just being a bystander; I was actively hiding something from Sarah, and it didn’t sit right with me.

After a few drinks, I let slip a comment about “the fun time at the bar last week” in front of Jake, thinking it might prompt him to confess. He looked at me confused, and I saw a flicker of panic on his face. I didn’t mean to create a scene, but it was like the truth was begging to come out. Sarah saw the tension and asked what I meant, and I ended up getting dragged into an awkward conversation.

Long story short, Sarah ended up confronting Jake, but he denied everything. She was upset with both of us—me for implying something was wrong and him for not being truthful. I feel guilty because I didn't directly tell her what I saw, but I also think Jake was being deceitful and should have been honest in the first place. Now, our friendship is strained, and I can’t help but feel like I made things worse.

So, AITA for not coming clean about what I saw, or for saying something at the party?",322,2280,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_92108,2022-08-10 00:00:00,ESH,2057,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I (23F) live in a shared apartment with two other roommates, and things have been pretty tense lately. One of my roommates, Sarah (22F), has a boyfriend who spends the night almost every weekend. I don’t mind them being together, but the problem is that they’re super loud and it’s really disruptive. I’ve had to deal with their noise late at night and sometimes even early in the morning. 

I’ve mentioned to Sarah a couple of times that it’s hard for me to sleep when they’re being so noisy, but she always brushes it off and says they’re just having fun. Lately, I’ve been feeling increasingly frustrated because I have early classes and need my sleep.

Last weekend, I’d had a particularly rough week, and I was so fed up with their antics. So, thinking it was fair game, I decided to invite my boyfriend over for the night too. I was determined to make some noise of my own. We were intentionally loud, and I even cranked up the music a bit. I know it was petty, but I felt like I was finally getting back at them for all the sleepless nights.

Afterward, Sarah confronted me about it, saying that it was inconsiderate of me to do that, especially since they were just enjoying their time together. I argued that I was just matching their energy and that they needed to be more mindful. Now, we’re both upset with each other, and the atmosphere in the apartment is pretty awkward.

Recently, one of my closest friends, Jake, has been dating a girl named Lisa for a few months. From the start, I wasn't too fond of her because she’s been quite controlling and dismissive of Jake's friendships. 

Last week, Jake invited all of us to his birthday party, but Lisa insisted on planning everything and wanted to limit the number of people invited. I wasn't comfortable with that and shared my concerns with Jake, hoping he’d see how unfair she was being. He brushed it off, saying Lisa was just trying to help.

At the party, things took a turn. I tried to engage with Jake, but Lisa kept interrupting and making snide comments about my friendship with him. At one point, I snapped and told her to back off. Things escalated, and I ended up calling her manipulative in front of everyone. Jake looked really upset, and Lisa walked out in tears.

Afterward, Jake confronted me, saying I embarrassed him and hurt Lisa’s feelings. I felt bad for the fallout but also thought I was right to stand up for our friendship. I ended up leaving the party early, and now Jake isn't talking to me. I can understand why he’s upset, but I also think I had a right to defend myself and our friendship.

I feel like I might have been an asshole for how I handled it, but I also believe Lisa was overstepping her bounds.

I had brought a few bottles of wine, and Jake showed up with a case of beer. As the night went on, things got a bit rowdy, but everyone was having a good time.

At one point, Jake made a joke about me being ""the mom friend"" because I was trying to keep everything organized and make sure everyone was safe. I laughed it off initially, but he kept pushing it, making more jokes about how I was just there to babysit everyone. I felt embarrassed and frustrated because I was genuinely trying to help. After a few drinks, I snapped at him and told him to stop being such a jerk and to grow up.

Things escalated a bit, and Jake got upset. He called me a buzzkill and said I was ruining the party. I told him I didn't appreciate his comments and that he needed to respect my feelings. The argument got louder, and eventually, we both decided to just cool off and separate for the night.

The next day, Jake texted me, saying I overreacted and that I was being sensitive. I replied that I felt he was being really disrespectful and that I was just trying to be a good friend. He said I should lighten up and not take everything so seriously.

Now we’re not talking, and I feel like we both crossed some lines. I shouldn’t have snapped at him like that, but I also think he should have been more considerate.

However, I’ve noticed that over the past year, our dynamic has changed a bit. I’m in a stable job, making decent money, while Jake has been struggling to find consistent work since he lost his job at the start of the pandemic. 

Recently, Jake reached out to me and asked if I could help him out with rent for the month. He explained that he had a few interviews lined up but was running low on savings and needed just $500 to cover his rent. I felt bad for him, but I was hesitant because I’ve lent him money before—usually for small things like groceries or bills—and he hasn’t always paid me back on time. I’ve also been trying to save up for a big trip I’ve planned for next year.

After thinking it over, I told Jake that I couldn’t help him this time. I explained my financial situation and that I needed to prioritize my own savings. He got really upset and accused me of not being a supportive friend. I countered that I had supported him in the past and that he needed to take responsibility for his finances.

In the heat of the moment, I may have snapped and said something like, “Maybe if you’d been more responsible with your job search, you wouldn’t be in this position.” Jake got defensive, and we ended up having a pretty heated argument. Afterward, I felt bad for how I spoke to him, but I also felt justified since I’ve helped him before and he hasn’t really changed his approach to getting back on his feet.

I’ve noticed that I’m the one picking up the slack more often. A few weeks ago, I had a rough week at work, and when I got home, I found the living room covered in dirty dishes, laundry strewn everywhere, and the trash overflowing. I was really stressed and overwhelmed, so I blew up at J, expressing how frustrated I was that I had to do everything myself. I told him it felt like he didn’t care about our living space or me.

He got defensive and said he was feeling overwhelmed too and that he needed a break. I acknowledged that everyone has tough weeks, but I felt he was using that as an excuse to avoid helping out. In response, I ended up saying some hurtful things, like how I felt like I was living with a child who didn’t care about cleanliness.

After that argument, J tried to pitch in more, but he ended up doing things his way, which didn’t really align with how I like the apartment to be organized. I would find him stacking dishes in a way that would topple over or leaving laundry in the wrong spot. I started snapping at him again, leading to more arguments. 

I know I should have appreciated his efforts, but his way of doing things just added to my frustration. It turned into a cycle where I would get annoyed, he would retreat, and then I would feel guilty for how I treated him. 

Last week, we had another blowup after he forgot to take out the trash again, and I accused him of not caring about our home. He shot back that I never acknowledge the little things he does and that I’m too hard on him. We both ended up feeling hurt and misunderstood.

Dirty dishes pile up in the sink, crumbs are left on the counters, and food spills often go unnoticed for days.

Everyone sucks here,"Hi all. 

I have a younger brother, Jake, who just turned 16. He’s a good kid overall, but he has a tendency to be a bit self-centered and doesn’t always think through his actions. My parents have always been a bit strict with him, but they also tend to spoil him with things like video games and gadgets.

Last weekend, Jake decided to throw a small party at our house while our parents were away for the weekend. He assured me it would just be a few friends, but before I knew it, there were over a dozen kids in our living room, and it quickly turned into a loud, chaotic mess. I was frustrated because I had planned to use the time to catch up on some schoolwork and relax. 

Initially, I tried to be a good sister and helped him set up the party. I even bought snacks for him and his friends. But as the night went on, it became clear that Jake wasn’t keeping things under control. They were drinking and being rowdy, and at some point, someone knocked over a lamp, which broke. I confronted Jake about it, but he shrugged it off, saying it was no big deal.

As the night progressed, the noise level escalated and they started messing around with the furniture, which really upset me. I finally snapped and told everyone to leave. I raised my voice and said Jake was being irresponsible and that I was tired of cleaning up after him. In the heat of the moment, I may have called him “a spoiled brat” in front of his friends.

After everyone left, Jake was furious with me and we had a huge fight. He accused me of ruining his night and embarrassing him in front of his friends. I told him he was the one who made a mess of things and that he should have listened to me when I told him to keep it low-key. He ended up storming to his room, and I felt guilty about the way I handled it.

The next day, we both ended up apologizing to each other. He admitted he should have been more responsible, and I acknowledged that I didn’t need to call him names, even if I was frustrated. My parents came home to find the place still a bit messy, and we both got in trouble for not managing the situation better.

Looking back, I realize we were both at fault. Jake for throwing an out-of-control party without considering the consequences, and me for losing my temper and not handling the situation more maturely.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I (28M) recently moved in with my long-term girlfriend (27F) after dating for three years. We had discussed our future together, and I was really excited about taking this next step. However, there was one big issue we never fully resolved: her love for cooking and my complete indifference towards it.

My girlfriend is a fantastic cook and loves experimenting with new recipes. She often invites me to join her in the kitchen, but honestly, I just don’t care about cooking. I prefer simple meals, and I’m fine with takeout. I’ve told her multiple times that I appreciate her efforts but that I really don’t want to spend hours in the kitchen. 

Fast forward to us living together. She cooks almost every day, and while I admire her passion, I often find myself in the living room watching TV while she’s busy cooking. I give her occasional compliments, but I mostly stay out of the way. I think she sees it as me not supporting her hobby, but I just don’t want to be a part of it. 

Recently, she asked me to help her prepare a meal for a dinner party we were hosting. I flat-out told her I wasn’t interested and that I would take care of the cleaning and setting up the dining area instead. She seemed disappointed but didn’t push it. Later that week, she decided to cook something special for the two of us as a surprise. I could tell she was really excited about it, but when I tasted the meal, I didn’t like it at all. 

Instead of being polite, I made a face and said, “I don’t think this works for me.” I instantly felt bad, and she got upset, saying I could have at least pretended to like it. I brushed it off, thinking it was just a meal, and suggested that maybe she should stick to simpler dishes in the future. 

Now, we’re both feeling frustrated. She thinks I’m dismissive of her passion, and I feel like my preferences are being ignored. I know I was rude about the meal, and maybe I should have been more considerate about how much effort she put into it, but I also think she needs to recognize that I just don’t have the same enthusiasm for cooking. 

So, I’m wondering, am I the asshole for being honest about my feelings towards her cooking and not wanting to engage in it? Or is she overreacting?",343,2875,0.87,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_68871,2018-12-29 00:00:00,ESH,2223,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I'm 25 and have a pretty good relationship with my mom, but her boyfriend, Mark, really gets under my skin. He’s always making these offhand comments that are supposed to be funny but just come off as condescending. For example, he'll often say things like, ""Don't worry, I can show you how to do that, sweetheart,"" whenever I’m working on something. It’s infuriating because I’m a grown adult and I don’t need someone to hold my hand. 

Mark has also started to come to family dinners more often and takes every opportunity to put me in my place in front of my mom. Last week, he did it again. My mom asked me about my job, and when I explained a project I was working on, he interrupted with a laugh, saying, “Wow, sounds complicated! Good thing you have someone to help you, huh?” I snapped and shot back, “Yeah, good thing I don’t need a babysitter to handle it.” 

After that, things got tense. My mom told me I was being rude and that I should show him some respect, while Mark acted all hurt and defensive. I felt justified, but I could tell I crossed a line. I know he means well, but I can’t stand the way he talks to me. I’ve tried to have a conversation with my mom about how it bothers me, but she just says I need to be more patient with him.

Everyone sucks here,"Title: AITA for not wanting to share my promotion celebration with my friend?

So here's the situation. I recently got promoted at work, and I was really excited about it. To celebrate, I decided to treat myself to a nice dinner at a restaurant I really like. I mentioned it to my friend, who has been struggling to find a job for a while now. She immediately asked if she could join me to celebrate my achievement.

At first, I was hesitant because I wanted this to be a personal celebration. I also knew that she’s been feeling down about her job situation, and I was worried that my celebrating would make her feel worse. But I didn’t want to hurt her feelings, so I agreed.

When we got to the restaurant, everything was going well until I started talking about my new job, all the responsibilities, and how I was looking forward to new challenges. I noticed that my friend was getting increasingly quiet and seemed less interested in the conversation. I tried to engage her by asking about her job search, but she brushed it off and didn't want to talk about it.

At some point, I could tell she was getting upset, so I suggested we change the subject. Instead of letting it go, she brought up how she felt so envious that I got promoted while she's still struggling. I felt really awkward and didn’t know how to respond. I tried to reassure her, but it turned into a discussion about how I was ""just lucky"" and how she felt like she never catches a break.

In the moment, I got frustrated and told her that I didn’t want to feel guilty about my success and that it was okay for me to celebrate without feeling like I had to downplay it because of her feelings. She got really upset and said I was being insensitive and selfish for not considering her feelings during my celebration.

Now, I feel bad because I didn’t mean to hurt her, but I also think it’s unfair for her to try to make me feel guilty about my achievements. Am I the asshole for wanting to celebrate my promotion without feeling bad about it? Or for getting frustrated with her when she expressed her jealousy?

Everyone sucks here,"So, I’ve been friends with this guy, Jake, for a few years now. He’s a great dude, but he has this habit of going on and on about his latest crushes. Recently, he started talking about this girl, Mia, who he’s really into. He told me he was planning to ask her out, and I was supportive, encouraging him to go for it.

A couple of days later, I bumped into Mia at a coffee shop. We ended up chatting for a while, and I thought she seemed really cool. I mentioned that Jake had a crush on her and that he was planning to ask her out. In hindsight, I realize I probably shouldn’t have said anything, but I thought it would be sweet for her to know. 

Mia seemed flattered but also a bit surprised. She told me she didn’t feel the same way about Jake, but she appreciated me telling her. I felt a bit awkward after our conversation, but I thought I was just being a good friend by being honest.

Later that week, Jake asked me if I had seen Mia and what she thought about him. I hesitated but ended up telling him that I mentioned his crush, but I didn’t give him the details about her not being interested. I didn’t want to hurt his feelings, and I thought maybe he could still pursue her if he really thought they had a connection.

Fast forward to a few weeks later, and Jake is still all about Mia. I can see he’s getting more and more invested, while Mia seems to be avoiding him. Eventually, he found out from another friend that Mia wasn’t interested, and he was pretty upset with me for not being more upfront about it. He thinks I should’ve just told him the whole truth when I had the chance.

I feel bad because I didn’t want to hurt his feelings, but I also realize that I kind of led him on by not being honest. And now, I can see that I’ve messed things up for both of them. I’ve been trying to apologize to Jake, but he seems pretty hurt and distant now.

So, AITA for trying to protect my friend’s feelings, or should I have been more honest with him from the get-go? I thought I was doing the right thing, but now I wonder if I was just being selfish.",522,738,0.67,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_43293,2022-07-03 00:00:00,ESH,2065,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I recently had a pretty heated situation with my roommate that left both of us feeling frustrated. To give some context, we’ve lived together for about a year, and while we generally get along, we have our differences. I’m pretty laid back, while he tends to be more uptight and controlling about our shared space.

A few weeks ago, I had some friends over for a small gathering. We were having a good time, playing games, and enjoying some drinks. My roommate had mentioned earlier in the week that he wanted to keep the apartment clean since he was worried about an upcoming visit from his family. I assured him that we would keep the noise down and wouldn’t mess up too much.

However, as the night went on, things got a bit louder than I expected. We were all having fun, and I didn’t think too much of it. Around midnight, my roommate came out of his room, clearly annoyed. He started yelling at us to be quiet and to clean up. I snapped back, saying it was just one night and that he could deal with it. I didn’t mean to be rude, but I was caught up in the moment. 

After he went back to his room, I felt bad for how I reacted, so I sent him a text apologizing and offered to help clean up in the morning. He didn’t respond, but I figured he just needed some space. The next morning, I woke up to find that he had already cleaned up everything without waiting for me. I offered to help with the dishes, but he shot me down, saying he didn’t want me touching anything anymore. 

I ended up getting annoyed because I felt like he was overreacting about a single night of fun. I told him he was being dramatic, and he said I was inconsiderate for not respecting his wishes. We argued for a bit, and it ended with both of us being upset and not talking for a few days. 

Looking back, I know I could have handled my reaction better, but I also think he was too rigid. So, AITA for standing my ground during the party, or was he justified in being upset?",356,942,0.52,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_17393,2024-02-26 00:00:00,ESH,1956,AITA

A few weeks ago, we were playing a really intense session. I was having a rough day, and when I made a mistake in the game, I laughed it off and said, “Well, that’s just me being me.” I thought it was funny, but Jason didn’t take it that way. He started berating me for my gameplay, saying things like, “You need to take this seriously if you ever want to get better!”

I snapped back, telling him he didn’t have to be such a jerk about it and that it was just a game. I pointed out that he wasn’t exactly a pro himself and needed to chill out. He got defensive and said I was ruining the fun for everyone with my attitude.

We ended up arguing back and forth, both of us saying hurtful things. I called him overly competitive and toxic, while he accused me of being lazy and not trying hard enough. After that, we decided to take a break from gaming together since it got so heated.

Now, our mutual friends are caught in the middle, and they think we both acted immaturely. I really just wanted to enjoy the game and not feel pressure, but I may have overreacted to his criticism.

Everyone sucks here,"This happened last month. I was at a local park with my dog, trying to enjoy a nice weekend afternoon. The weather was perfect, and I had brought a book to read while my dog played.

As I was settling in, a woman with two kids approached me. The kids were probably around 8 and 10 years old. The woman asked if I could watch her kids for a bit while she went to grab something from her car. I was a bit taken aback, but I figured it would only be a few minutes, and they seemed to be well-behaved, so I said yes.

She left, and the kids started playing with my dog, which was fine at first. However, a few minutes turned into 20 minutes, and I began to feel uncomfortable. I tried to keep an eye on the kids, but they started wandering away from my area. I called out to them to come back, but they were more interested in running around and playing tag.

When the mom finally came back, she looked frazzled and immediately started scolding her kids for wandering off. I mentioned that I didn’t realize she would be gone so long and that I wasn’t really prepared to babysit. She got defensive, saying that it was just a short errand and that I should have been more responsible.

Feeling frustrated, I snapped back that I was not their babysitter and that she shouldn't have left them with a stranger. This led to a yelling match between us, and several people in the park started to stare.

In the heat of the moment, I ended up telling her she should have been more responsible as a parent, and she shot back that I should have been more understanding and helpful. Eventually, she stormed off with her kids, and I felt bad about how it escalated, but I also felt justified in what I said.

During the party, my sister’s fiancé, Jake, started making some comments about how he could never date a girl who was taller than him. He’s around 5’7”, and my sister is about 5’10”. At first, I thought he was joking, but then he kept talking about how height is a big deal in relationships, and how he wouldn’t want “a giant” walking around next to him.

I was a bit taken aback by his comments and didn’t really appreciate the way he was talking about my sister. I mean, she’s not just some trophy to be measured against his standards, right? So I chimed in and said, “Well, good luck telling my sister she’s too tall for you, buddy. Maybe you should have thought about that before proposing.”

Jake looked really offended and shot back that I was being rude and that he was just sharing his personal preferences. I replied, “Yeah, but you could have done that without being an idiot about it.” The atmosphere got awkward, and my sister looked really uncomfortable.

A few family members tried to intervene, and my parents were clearly upset with me for escalating the situation. Jake ended up walking away, and my sister pulled me aside later to tell me that I made things worse and that I embarrassed her in front of everyone.

I tried talking to him about it, asking if he could try to keep the noise down when he comes in at night. He brushed it off, saying he shouldn’t have to change his routine just because I’m an early riser. I understand his point, but I was getting tired of being woken up every single night.

In retaliation, I started playing loud music in the living room early every morning while I made breakfast. I figured if he could keep me up at night, I could wake him up in the morning. I made it a point to play my music at full volume, often choosing songs that were upbeat and a little obnoxious. He complained, but I told him it was just part of living together and that he should get used to it.

As the night went on, we started playing a party game that involved sharing embarrassing stories. It was all in good fun until it was Sarah’s turn. She decided to share a story about a time I had a particularly embarrassing moment at a previous party—one where I accidentally spilled a drink all over myself and made a complete fool of myself. While everyone laughed, I felt a little uneasy. It wasn’t the best memory for me, and I was surprised she would bring it up in front of everyone.

Later, during a game of charades, Sarah made a comment about my performance that felt a little too personal. In a moment of frustration, I snapped back and called her a ""lame attention-seeker"" in front of everyone.

One day, I exploded and confronted Alex about it. I told him that living with someone messy was driving me crazy and that he needed to step up. Alex got defensive and said he thought I was being uptight and controlling, which hurt because I was just trying to suggest a compromise. We ended up having a huge argument where we both said things we didn’t mean. 

To make matters worse, I found out that Alex has been feeling really stressed about work and is dealing with some personal issues. I didn't know this when I confronted him, and I realize now that I could have approached the situation with more understanding. Instead, I just added to his stress.

So, we both contributed to the toxic atmosphere in our apartment. I feel guilty for not being more compassionate, and I know he shouldn't have dismissed my feelings about cleanliness, either. Now we're both walking on eggshells, and I don’t know how to fix things. 

So, AITA for confronting him about the mess, or is he the one being unreasonable?",421,1077,0.82,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_73801,2018-07-03 00:00:00,ESH,1794,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I’ve always been a bit of a night owl. I thrive when everyone else is winding down for the day, and I often find myself being the most productive late at night. My roommate, Lisa, however, is the complete opposite. She goes to bed early and wakes up at the crack of dawn, ready to take on the day.

We share a small two-bedroom apartment, and our schedules have been clashing more frequently lately. Lisa has a demanding job, and she likes to get her beauty sleep, which I totally understand. However, I often stay up working or gaming, and the noise from my keyboard and occasional video calls can be disruptive.

Recently, Lisa confronted me about the noise. She told me that she had been losing sleep because of it and asked if I could keep it down after a certain hour. I agreed to try my best, but I also reminded her that I do pay half the rent, and I feel like I should be able to use the space how I want, especially since I’m not trying to be loud on purpose.

One night, I was really engrossed in a project and lost track of time. I had my headphones on, but I didn’t realize how loud I was talking during a call. Lisa knocked on my door and asked me to keep it down, but I was frustrated and told her that she was being unreasonable and that it’s not fair for her to dictate how I use the apartment.

Things escalated, and we ended up arguing, with both of us raising our voices. I said some hurtful things about her needing to be more flexible, and she called me inconsiderate. Afterward, we both felt bad about the argument, but the tension is still there.

So, Reddit, AITA for wanting to use my space how I want, or is she right for wanting a quieter environment to sleep? I think we both messed up a bit in how we handled it.",512,887,1.0,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_28638,2023-04-06 00:00:00,ESH,1741,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Hi everyone, first time posting here.

I’m [30M] and my best friend [32M], let’s call him Jake, and I have been close since college. Over the years, we've shared a lot, including living together for a while. Recently, though, our friendship has hit a rough patch.

Jake has been struggling with his job and is going through a tough time. He started to lose motivation and has been quite negative lately. I’ve tried to be supportive, but it’s been really draining. I often find myself feeling down after our conversations because he tends to focus on the negative rather than looking for solutions.

Last week, I invited him over for game night to help him unwind. I thought it would be a good distraction. Unfortunately, as the night went on, he started venting about his job and how unfair life is. At first, I tried to listen, but eventually, I snapped. I told him that while I understand he's going through a tough time, he needs to start taking responsibility for his situation instead of complaining all the time. I mentioned that I feel like he needs to change his mindset if he wants things to improve.

Jake got really upset and accused me of not being supportive. He said he just needed a friend to listen and not judge him. I ended up getting frustrated and told him that he’s pushing people away with his negativity and that he needs to figure things out on his own sometimes.

After he left, I felt really bad. I reached out to him the next day to apologize for how I spoke to him, but he didn't respond. It’s been a few days and our communication has been pretty much non-existent since then. I honestly don't know if I overstepped or if he just needs to be called out on his behavior.

So, am I the asshole for confronting him about his negativity and trying to push him to improve, or is he overreacting? ESH?",652,2409,0.83,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_96592,2023-07-09 00:00:00,ESH,1824,AITA

Sarah is a bit more outgoing and has a tendency to overstep boundaries without realizing it.

We all went to a party together last weekend, and Jake and I were having a great time catching up. At one point, Sarah decided to take it upon herself to ""liven things up"" and started dancing in a very attention-seeking way. Jake found it funny at first, but when she began to act really provocatively, I could see he was getting uncomfortable.

I tried to subtly tell Sarah to tone it down because I could see how it was affecting Jake, but she just laughed it off and said I was being boring. When Jake finally spoke up and told her he didn’t like the way she was acting, Sarah got defensive. She accused him of trying to control her and said that we were both being judgmental. I felt the tension rising and tried to mediate the situation, but I ended up getting frustrated.

In the heat of the moment, I snapped at Sarah and told her she always makes everything about herself and never thinks about how her actions affect others. She got really upset and left the party early. I felt bad afterward, but I also stood by what I said because I genuinely think she crosses lines and doesn't respect boundaries.

The next day, Jake texted me saying I shouldn't have yelled at Sarah and that I should have just let her be herself. I told him I was just looking out for him, and he said that I shouldn’t have put him in a position where he had to choose between us.

About a month ago, Mia started dating this guy, Ethan (17M). At first, we were all excited for her, but then it became clear that she was spending all her time with him and completely ignoring our plans. Jake and I tried to be supportive; we understood that new relationships can be intense. However, it started to feel like she was ditching us regularly. 

Last week, we had a planned outing for the three of us, but Mia texted us last minute to say she couldn't make it because Ethan had surprised her with concert tickets. I was already frustrated because this was the third time she had canceled on us, and I snapped. I texted her, “You know, we used to have fun together before you got with Ethan. It feels like you don't even care about our friendship anymore!”

She responded with a long message about how I was being selfish and that she loved us but was just happy in her relationship. At that point, I was really hurt, and I told her, “Maybe you should figure out if you actually want friends or just a boyfriend because it seems like you can’t have both.”

I didn’t expect her to react the way she did. She ended up leaving the group chat and said she needed space. Jake and I talked about it, and he agreed that I may have gone overboard, but he also felt like Mia was neglecting our friendship. 

Now, it’s super awkward between all of us. I'm starting to feel guilty for what I said, but at the same time, I feel justified because I miss my friend.

One day, I snapped and confronted him about it. I told him that he needs to stop being lazy and start taking his job search seriously. I mentioned how I worked hard to get where I am and that he needs to put in the effort too. He got defensive and said that I was being a jerk, and that it’s not easy to find a job in this market.

Mark made a joke about my job, saying something like, “At least you’re not working that dead-end job forever,” which I took as a dig. I know he didn’t mean it maliciously, but I felt my temper flare up. Instead of just brushing it off, I shot back at him and made a comment about how he was never going to get his life together and still lived with his parents at 30.

I'm a huge planner; I love having everything scheduled and organized. My partner, on the other hand, is more spontaneous and prefers to go with the flow.

Last week, we had a weekend trip planned to visit some friends in another city. I had everything mapped out, from the time we would leave to the places we would stop for food. I even made a packing list for both of us. The night before we were supposed to leave, I reminded my partner to pack, and they said they would do it in the morning.

After the breakup, Sarah was in a really bad place. She was crying constantly and was very withdrawn.

To be honest, I wasn’t thrilled about it. I’m usually the one who’s a bit more guarded about bringing boyfriends into our friend group until I know them well. I voiced my concerns to Sarah, saying it felt a bit too soon and that I didn’t want the dynamics to change, especially since we usually had a close-knit vibe.

Sarah got defensive, insisting that everyone should be open to meeting new people, and that Jake was a great guy. She accused me of being elitist and not wanting her to have a good time. I relented, telling her I would at least give him a chance, but I remained skeptical.

He was loud, made inappropriate jokes, and acted like he was trying too hard to impress everyone. I also caught him making some offhand comments that felt dismissive towards the rest of us, which bothered me.

Last week, I was looking forward to our game night, but when I arrived, I found out that Emily had decided to take over the evening. She brought her own games, insisted on playing a specific type of board game that none of us really liked, and kept trying to dictate the rules. My friends seemed uncomfortable, but no one spoke up. I tried to suggest we play one of our usual games and even brought a couple of my favorites, but she just brushed them aside.

After a while, I lost my patience and jokingly said something like, ""Wow, it feels like we're here for Emily's game night and not ours."" Jake got upset and told me I was being rude and dismissive. I told him that I just wanted us to have our night like we always do, but he said that if I couldn't accept her, I was welcome to leave. I ended up leaving in frustration, and now I'm feeling guilty for how I handled the situation.

Later, I texted Jake to apologize for being harsh, but I also told him that I think Emily needs to understand that this is our tradition and not her personal game night. He replied that he thinks it would be best if I stayed away from future game nights until I can be more accepting of her. 

Now I feel conflicted. I do think I overreacted and could have approached it differently, but I also believe my feelings about our game nights are valid. I’m worried I’ve ruined my friendship with Jake and that I didn’t handle the situation well. AITA?",376,2066,0.9,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_34970,2021-08-03 00:00:00,ESH,1903,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I (28M) recently had a falling out with my younger brother (24M) over a family event. Growing up, our parents were strict about our relationship with each other, constantly comparing us and pitting us against one another. This created a lot of tension and resentment between us, but we both tried to keep some form of a relationship as adults.

Recently, our family planned a reunion for the first time in years. I was excited to see everyone, but my brother had some different ideas. He reached out to me a few weeks before the event, asking if I would be willing to lend him some money to help cover his travel expenses. I was hesitant because he had borrowed money from me in the past and never paid it back, plus I was saving for a trip of my own. I told him I couldn't help him this time, and he got really upset.

Fast forward to the reunion, and my brother showed up with a girlfriend who I had never met before. During the event, I noticed him making fun of me in front of her, telling stories from our childhood that painted me as the bad guy. I felt embarrassed and hurt, but instead of confronting him in the moment, I decided to play along and make some jokes at his expense, trying to keep the mood light.

After a few hours of this back-and-forth, my brother pulled me aside and confronted me about making fun of him. I told him I was just giving back what he was throwing at me. This escalated into a full-blown argument where we both ended up saying some pretty hurtful things. Our parents intervened, and it turned into a chaotic scene.

Now, my brother is furious with me and is saying he feels betrayed because I didn’t support him at the reunion and I didn’t help him out financially. I feel like he was trying to undermine me in front of his girlfriend and the family. I honestly think we both overreacted, but I’m left wondering if I should have just let his jokes slide and stayed quiet, or if I was justified in standing up for myself.

I appreciate his enthusiasm, but I'm just not that into working out. I prefer to stay active in my own ways, like hiking or biking, but I don't want to lift weights or run on a treadmill.

One day, Alex cornered me and started lecturing me about how important it is to maintain a gym routine and how I’m wasting my potential by not pushing myself harder. I tried to explain that I’m happy with my lifestyle, but he just kept insisting that I was making a huge mistake and that I’d regret it when I was older. 

I got frustrated and told him that he sounded like a condescending jerk who thinks his way is the only way. In the heat of the moment, I also brought up that he used to be really out of shape and that his obsession with fitness is just a cover-up for his insecurities. He got really upset, saying I was being unfair and harsh, and stormed out of my apartment.

Now I feel bad about how I reacted, but I still think he was overstepping by pushing me so hard. I don't think I should have said what I did about his past, but I was just so tired of him lecturing me. AITA?",715,665,0.89,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_33127,2024-04-13 00:00:00,ESH,1202,AITA

When they arrived, I noticed her boyfriend was wearing a vintage band t-shirt with a bunch of holes in it. It looked like it had seen better days. I jokingly said, ""Wow, nice shirt! Did you get it from a thrift store or is it just really old and worn out?"" I laughed, thinking it was a lighthearted tease. However, my friend's boyfriend didn't seem to take it well. He just stared at me and didn’t respond, and the atmosphere became awkward.

Feeling the tension, I tried to lighten the mood by complimenting my friend's outfit, hoping to divert attention from the comment I made. But instead, her boyfriend snapped, saying, ""It’s called vintage, dude. Maybe you should learn about fashion before making jokes."" I felt embarrassed and defensive, so I shot back, ""Sorry, I just thought we could joke around. No need to be rude.""

At this point, my friend looked really uncomfortable. She tried to mediate, saying, ""Can we just enjoy the evening without fighting?"" I agreed but still felt justified in my initial comment. The rest of the night was tense, with everyone trying to avoid the topic. 

After they left, my friend texted me saying I should apologize to her boyfriend for what I said. I was confused because I felt like he overreacted, but I also didn’t want to hurt her feelings.

I (28M) have a close-knit group of friends that I’ve known since college. We all used to hang out regularly, but as we’ve gotten older and life has become busier with jobs and relationships, our meetups have become less frequent. I live with my boyfriend (30M), who is really social and always encourages me to maintain those friendships. 

Last month, we planned a weekend getaway with my friends. I was really looking forward to it because I missed them, but I also had a lot of work piling up. I decided to go on the trip anyway, thinking it would be a nice break from my stress. However, as the weekend approached, my workload increased, and I ended up feeling really overwhelmed. 

During the trip, I found it hard to relax because my mind was constantly racing with thoughts about the tasks I needed to complete. I tried to engage with my friends, but I ended up being a bit withdrawn and distracted. I also received a few urgent messages from work that I felt I had to respond to. 

***\~present\~***

On the second night of the trip, my friends planned a big night out. Everyone was excited, but I was feeling guilty about not being fully present and about the work I needed to catch up on. When they started pressuring me to join them, I snapped. I told them that I didn’t want to go out and that they should have just left me at home if they wanted to ignore my stress. I ended up storming off to our rental to work. 

The next morning, I woke up to find that my friends were disappointed and hurt by my outburst. They felt that I had come on the trip only to ruin it with my negativity. They confronted me about it, and I felt defensive, insisting that I had a right to prioritize my work. In the heat of the moment, I told them that they didn’t understand how hard it was to balance everything, and I blamed them for not being more supportive. 

Now, back home, I feel terrible about how I handled things. My friends have been distant, and I can tell they’re put off by my behavior. I realize that I could have communicated my stress better instead of lashing out. At the same time, I feel like they didn’t take my workload seriously and pressured me into a situation I wasn’t comfortable with.

We both had a long week at work, and the plan was to chill, order some pizza, and watch a few movies. I was in charge of picking up the food. On my way there, I texted her to ask if she wanted something different than what we discussed. I thought it would be nice to surprise her. She replied with a long list of things she wanted, which I didn’t have time to read fully because I was driving.

I ended up getting what I thought was a good mix of our usual favorites: pepperoni pizza, garlic knots, and some wings. When I got to her place, she looked at the food and immediately frowned. She said she wanted vegan options and a salad, which I totally missed since I didn’t read her text. I felt bad, but I also thought she could just eat the pizza, and I tried to explain that I had a lot on my plate that day.

We started watching the first movie, but the vibe was off. Every time I reached for a slice, she made a comment about how I didn’t bother to consider her preferences. I snapped back, saying it wasn’t my fault she didn’t communicate clearly, and that I was just trying to make the night enjoyable. Things escalated, and soon we were both arguing about how we should have handled the food situation better.

By the end of the night, we were both upset, and I felt like I couldn’t even enjoy the movie. I ended up leaving early, and now we haven’t talked since.

Everyone was really excited for him and asked a ton of questions. I jokingly said, ""Is she a keeper, or just another one of your flings?"" I thought it was a light-hearted tease since Jake has had a few short-term relationships in the past.

Well, everyone laughed, but Jake got kind of quiet, and I could tell he was uncomfortable. Later on, my aunt pulled me aside and told me that I shouldn't have made that comment because Jake was really serious about Lisa and my joke made him feel belittled. I thought maybe she was overreacting, but I apologized to her to keep the peace.

When I went back to the table, I noticed Jake was still quiet, so I tried to lighten the mood by sharing a funny story about our childhood. But instead of laughing, he snapped at me, saying that maybe I should stop trying to be funny when it clearly wasn’t working. This escalated into a bit of a family argument, with my other relatives jumping in to defend either me or Jake.

In the end, I felt like we all handled the situation poorly. I shouldn't have made that joke, and Jake shouldn’t have lashed out at me like that.

So, I (30F) have a younger sister (24F) who recently had a baby. I love my niece and I try to support my sister as much as I can. I’ve been watching the baby once a week while my sister works, and it’s been a great bonding experience for me. However, things took a turn last week.

My sister is a bit of a germaphobe and is very strict about who can hold the baby. She’s particularly upset about people who don’t get vaccinated for various reasons. She’s always lecturing me about how important it is to keep the baby safe from illness, which I totally get. I’m fully vaccinated and take health precautions seriously.

However, during my last visit, I had a friend (31F) over who wanted to meet the baby. I thought it would be okay since I’m around the baby all the time, but my sister completely flipped out when she found out. She accused me of being irresponsible and putting her child at risk. I tried to explain that my friend was also vaccinated and that we were being cautious, but she wouldn’t hear it.

In my frustration, I told her she was being overbearing and that it’s not healthy to be such a control freak. I thought I was just being honest, but it really hurt her feelings. Now, she’s upset with me and says I don’t respect her parenting choices.

I feel bad for upsetting her, but I also think she needs to lighten up a little. We both said some harsh things during the argument, and now it feels like there’s a rift between us that shouldn’t be there.

Everyone sucks here,"My friend Jake has been dating his girlfriend Emma for about a year now. I really like Emma, but Jake has been acting increasingly possessive and controlling over her, to the point where it's starting to concern me. He constantly checks her phone when they’re together, gets upset if she hangs out with friends without him, and has made a few offhand comments about how she should dress or what she should do.

One night, I was at a party where both Jake and Emma were present. Emma was talking to a few friends of hers, and Jake was sitting off to the side, looking visibly annoyed. I decided to go over and chat with him. During our conversation, he made another one of those comments about how Emma should be more mindful of his feelings and not wear such revealing clothes when she’s out with friends. That really rubbed me the wrong way, and I told him that he was being unreasonable and that Emma deserves to wear whatever she wants. I basically said he needs to trust her more or else he risks pushing her away.

Jake took this as me siding with Emma and got angry. He accused me of trying to undermine him in front of her. In the heat of the moment, I told him he needed to stop being so controlling and to think about how Emma might feel. Unfortunately, Emma overheard this exchange and looked really uncomfortable. Jake got defensive and stormed off, and Emma followed him to try to calm him down.

A few days later, I texted Emma to apologize for how things went down. I told her I didn’t mean to put her in a difficult position and that I just wanted her to be happy. She thanked me but seemed hesitant. In retrospect, I realize that I might have overstepped and created unnecessary tension between them. But I also believe that Jake’s behavior is concerning and needed to be addressed.

Emily and Jake dated for a brief period in college, and while she insists she is over him, I know there are still some unresolved feelings on her part. When I first started talking to Jake, I made sure to tell Emily right away. I thought I was being respectful, but she seemed to brush it off and said she was happy for me.

I need some perspective on a situation that happened a few weeks ago, and I've been feeling guilty about it ever since. So, a little background: I (27F) have a close friend, Jess (26F), who has been in a long-term relationship with her boyfriend, Mark (28M). They’ve been together for about five years, and while I’ve always thought they were great together, I've noticed some issues lately.

Mark has been increasingly distant, not just with Jess but with everyone. He often cancels plans at the last minute and seems uninterested in being social. Jess has confided in me that she feels neglected and is worried about their relationship, but she’s also very much in love with him.

A few weeks ago, I was hanging out with Jess and she started crying about how she felt like she was losing Mark. I wanted to be supportive, but I also couldn’t help but feel frustrated with Mark for how he was treating her. In a moment of anger, I ended up texting Mark about how he needed to step up his game because Jess was hurting and deserved better.

Looking back, I realize that it was a huge overstep. Mark was understandably upset and confronted Jess about my message. This led to a big fight between them, and Jess felt caught in the middle. Mark accused her of not standing up for him, while Jess felt betrayed that I would reach out to him like that.

After things calmed down, Jess told me she appreciated my concern but that I really shouldn’t have contacted Mark directly. I apologized, but I still feel like I was trying to look out for her. Both of them are now upset with me, and I feel like I’ve created a rift in their relationship. 

So, AITA for texting my friend’s boyfriend about their relationship issues? I just wanted to help Jess, but now I’m feeling like a total jerk.

However, we have a recurring issue regarding our pets. I have a dog, Max, who I've had since he was a puppy, and she has a cat, Whiskers, who she adopted a few years ago.

When we first moved in together, we agreed that both pets would need to coexist peacefully. Initially, Whiskers was fearful of Max, which I understood. Max is a big, playful dog, and sometimes he gets too excited. I always tried to keep him in check around the cat, and over time, they started to tolerate each other.

Recently, though, Whiskers has started to act out. She'll scratch the furniture or knock things off shelves, and my girlfriend is convinced it's Max's fault for making her anxious. I’ve tried to reassure her that it’s just typical cat behavior, but she insists that the dog is the source of the problem.

Last week, while my girlfriend was out, I decided to take Max for a long walk to tire him out. When we returned, Whiskers was in a particularly feisty mood. I didn’t think much of it; I let Max off his leash, and he bounded over to her, wagging his tail. In response, Whiskers freaked out and hissed, which startled Max. He playfully barked back, and in the chaos, Whiskers knocked over a vase, breaking it.

When my girlfriend came home and saw the mess, she blamed me for not managing the situation better. I felt frustrated because I was just trying to give Max some exercise and wasn’t expecting this to happen. In retaliation, I started pointing out how Whiskers often gets into trouble on her own, like when she tore up my favorite hoodie. 

We ended up arguing about it, and I said some hurtful things about how her cat is a pain sometimes. She called me insensitive, and I told her she was overreacting about everything being Max’s fault.

Recently, I’ve been trying to eat healthier and stick to my meal plan, which includes a lot of fresh vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. I often buy specialty items for my meals, which can be a bit pricey. One evening, I made a big batch of quinoa salad loaded with veggies and herbs. I put the leftovers in a container and wrote my name on it, just to be clear.

Sam got really defensive and accused me of being unsupportive and not understanding what he was going through. I admit I was a bit harsh in my delivery, but I was feeling hurt and overwhelmed by his constant need for support without reciprocation. 

In a moment of anger, I told him that I couldn’t keep being his emotional crutch if he wasn’t going to make an effort in our friendship. He ended up storming out, and we haven’t spoken since.

Everyone sucks here,"Throwaway account for privacy reasons.

So, I (28F) have a close friend, Sarah (27F), who recently had a baby. I offered to help her with babysitting a couple of times a week to give her a break and to bond with the baby. I really enjoy spending time with kids, and I thought it would be a nice way to support her.

Last week, I planned to take care of the baby while Sarah went out for a much-needed girls' night. Before she left, she asked me about my plans for the evening. I joked that I might order pizza for us and watch some movies. She laughed and said that was great, but she wanted to make sure I’d feed the baby her pureed food instead of letting her eat anything from takeout.

Well, once Sarah left, I was feeling a little overwhelmed. The baby was crying, and I just wanted to calm her down. I ended up getting takeout for myself and thought, ""What's the harm in letting her have a little taste of my pizza crust?"" So, I handed her a small piece, thinking it wouldn’t hurt just this once.

When Sarah came back, she saw me with the baby and the crust and flipped out. She was really upset that I had disobeyed her instructions and was worried about how it could affect the baby's stomach. I tried to explain that it was just a little piece and she seemed to enjoy it, but she wouldn’t hear any of it. 

In the heat of the moment, I snapped back and said she was overreacting and that it was just food. We ended up having a pretty big argument, and she asked me to leave. I felt bad for upsetting her, but I also felt like she was being overly controlling.

Now I’m wondering if I was wrong for not following her instructions, but I also think she overreacted to the situation. AITA in this scenario?",329,1111,0.91,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_62088,2024-02-01 00:00:00,ESH,1713,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Hi everyone. First time posting here, so I appreciate any feedback.

Context:

My sister and I have always been close, but things have been rocky since she got engaged a few months ago. I’m really happy for her, but she’s been very much in her own world and has started to act like her wedding is the only thing that matters. She’s been planning every detail obsessively and has even made comments about how I should be ""honored"" to be her maid of honor.

Judgment needed:

Last week, I finally snapped during a conversation where she was ranting about her wedding guest list. I told her that while I support her and want her to be happy, her constant talk about the wedding was exhausting and selfish. I pointed out that I have a job, a life, and my own problems, and she shouldn’t expect me to drop everything for her wedding planning. I also reminded her that it’s okay to let people have other priorities besides her big day. 

She was really hurt by what I said and has been distant since. I feel guilty for how I handled the situation, but I also think she needs to understand that not everyone can be as consumed by the wedding as she is. I’ve canceled plans to help her with some aspects of the wedding because I feel she isn’t considering my feelings at all.

Everyone sucks here,"My friend and I have been close for years, but recently we got into a heated argument over a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance has been going through a tough time and has been relying on both of us for support. I felt overwhelmed and started venting to my friend about how I thought our acquaintance was being a bit needy and draining. My friend, however, took it upon themselves to confront our acquaintance about what I said without telling me they were going to do that.

When the confrontation happened, our acquaintance was understandably hurt and came to me upset, which put me in a really awkward position. I felt betrayed that my friend didn’t respect my thoughts and privacy, and I confronted them about it. My friend defended their actions by saying they wanted to help our acquaintance and thought I was being unsupportive.

We both ended up saying things we regretted. I accused my friend of being a busybody and not respecting my feelings, while they called me selfish for not being more empathetic.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I (F27) recently had a bit of a situation that’s been weighing on my mind. I was at a coffee shop with my friend, and we were enjoying our drinks and chatting. It was a pretty busy day, and the place was packed. 

At one point, I noticed a woman sitting alone at a table nearby with a couple of friends. She was visibly upset, and I could see her wiping away tears. Now, normally I wouldn’t intervene in someone else’s business, but I felt a bit compelled to say something, thinking maybe she just needed someone to reach out.

I approached her table with a friendly smile and said, “Hey, I couldn’t help but notice that you seem upset. Is everything okay?” She looked at me, surprised, and said, “I’m fine, thanks.” But I persisted, thinking that maybe she just needed a little more encouragement. “You know, it’s okay to talk about what’s bothering you. Sometimes just sharing can help.” 

That’s when her friends chimed in, clearly annoyed with me. One of them said, “She said she’s fine! Mind your own business.” I felt a bit taken aback but also defensive, thinking I was just trying to be kind. I shot back, “I’m just trying to be supportive! People shouldn’t have to suffer alone.” 

Things escalated a bit, and the woman started to get visibly upset by the interaction, telling me to just leave her alone. I felt embarrassed and frustrated, so I walked back to my table. My friend said I probably shouldn’t have pushed the issue, but I felt like I was just trying to help someone in need. 

In hindsight, I guess I should have respected her boundaries, but I also think her friends could have been kinder about it.

Everyone sucks here,"I live with my best friend, Alex, and another roommate, Jamie, in a 2-bedroom apartment. Alex and I have been friends for years, and I thought living together would be a breeze. However, I've noticed that Jamie has some pretty strange habits that have made living together a bit tense.

For instance, Jamie has a habit of leaving the kitchen in a total mess after cooking. Like, I’m not the biggest neat freak, but I do expect dishes to be rinsed and put in the dishwasher. Instead, Jamie just piles everything up in the sink and leaves it for days. I’ve brought it up a couple of times, gently suggesting that they should clean up after themselves, but it hasn’t changed anything.

Last week, I came home after a long day at work and found a mountain of dirty dishes in the sink, along with some old food that had been left out on the counter. I snapped and sent a group message to both Alex and Jamie, saying something like, “I’m tired of cleaning up after you, Jamie. Can you please just take responsibility for your mess?”

Jamie responded with a passive-aggressive message, saying, “Maybe if you weren’t so uptight, you wouldn’t care about a few dishes.” This made me even angrier, and I fired back with, “It’s not about being uptight; it’s about being considerate! You can’t just leave your mess for someone else to deal with!” 

That escalated into a back-and-forth where both of us said some really hurtful things. Jamie accused me of being a control freak, while I called Jamie lazy and inconsiderate. Alex tried to mediate, but it only seemed to make things worse, as Jamie started directing some of their anger at Alex too.

In a moment of frustration, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I took all of Jamie's dirty dishes and put them in their room, along with a note that said, “If you want to live like a slob, at least do it in your own space.” I thought this would be a wake-up call, but it just led to a huge argument where Jamie yelled at me for invading their privacy and ruining their space.

Now the atmosphere in the apartment is super tense. Jamie is still mad at me and has been giving me the cold shoulder, while Alex is stuck in the middle and trying to keep the peace. I feel justified in my actions because I really can’t stand the mess anymore, but I also regret how it all played out and how we ended up fighting.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I work part-time at a coffee shop, and one day during a slow shift, my coworker Alex and I were chatting about our weekend plans. I mentioned that I was going hiking with some friends, and Alex started sharing his plans to visit his family, who live a few hours away.

As we talked, another coworker, Jenna, overheard us and chimed in, saying that she thought family visits were overrated and that people should focus more on having fun than spending time with family. I didn’t think much of it at first, but I noticed that Alex looked a bit hurt by her comment, as he really values his family time.

In a moment of frustration, I said something like, “Well, Jenna, maybe if you had a family worth visiting, you’d understand.” The atmosphere in the shop instantly shifted. Jenna looked shocked, and Alex looked uncomfortable, not wanting to be in the middle of it. 

Jenna shot back, saying that I was being rude and that everyone has different family situations, and I was being insensitive. I argued back, saying that she needed to think before she spoke about something so personal. At this point, the tension escalated as other coworkers started to weigh in, siding with Jenna and saying I took it too far.

I ended up feeling frustrated because I thought I was just defending Alex, but I realized I may have crossed a line with my comment about Jenna's family. In hindsight, I could have handled the situation better and not made a personal dig. And Jenna shouldn’t have dismissed Alex’s feelings about his family in the first place.

I invited all of my friends and family, including my brother, to come and support us.

A few days before the gig, my brother told me that he had a big game the same night. I was disappointed but understood that he had prior commitments. On the day of the gig, I noticed he had posted on social media about his game but then mentioned that he was going to stop by after. I thought it was a little weird since his game was supposed to go late, but I was still happy that he planned to come.

During the gig, I saw him walk in halfway through our first set. I was thrilled to see him, but I also noticed he was wearing his team jersey and clearly had been drinking. After we finished our set, he came up to me and started loudly talking about his game, interrupting our performance. I asked him to keep it down and respect the music, but he just laughed it off.

After the gig, I confronted him about his behavior. I told him it was rude to overshadow my moment and that he should have stayed quiet or waited until the show was over. He snapped back, saying I was being too sensitive, and that it was just his way of showing support. Things escalated, and we ended up arguing in the parking lot.

Our parents later got involved, and now my brother is upset with me for ruining what was supposed to be a fun night. My friends have also said I was too harsh on him.

Everyone sucks here,"My partner (26 F) and I (27 M) have been together for three years, and we both share a passion for cooking and hosting dinner parties. Over the past year, we've developed a routine of inviting friends over every couple of weeks for a themed dinner night, which has been a lot of fun and has allowed us to try new recipes together.

Recently, we decided to host a dinner for some close friends of ours, but I also wanted to invite my sister (30 F), who I haven't seen in a while due to her busy schedule. My partner was a bit hesitant because she felt it would be too crowded and wanted to keep the gathering intimate. I argued that it would be nice for my sister to meet our friends, and I’d love for her to join us.

Despite my partner's concerns, I went ahead and invited my sister without fully discussing it with her first. I thought it would be a nice surprise and a way to reconnect as a group. When my partner found out, she was quite upset with me for not discussing the decision first and for going against her wishes. She felt it was unfair to change the plans we had mutually agreed upon.

In my defense, I didn't see it as a big deal since we have hosted larger dinners in the past. I thought my sister would fit right in and add to the fun. However, I also recognize that my partner has a vision for how she wants our gatherings to go, and I should have respected that rather than just deciding on my own.

When my sister arrived, it became clear that my partner felt overwhelmed and slightly resentful towards me. The atmosphere was tense, and I could tell she was upset that I hadn't considered her feelings enough before inviting my sister. I tried to lighten the mood, but it seemed like my partner was more focused on her frustrations than enjoying the evening.

At one point, my partner pulled me aside and told me that she felt I was being inconsiderate and selfish for not thinking through the impact of my decision on the evening.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I've been working at a local grocery store for about six months now, and I generally enjoy my job. I get along well with most of my coworkers, but there's one guy, Dave, who's been there longer and seems to think he knows everything about the job. He's often condescending, especially towards newer employees.

Recently, we got a shipment of fresh produce that needed to be stocked. Dave was assigned to do the backroom while I was tasked with organizing the display in the front. He kept making comments about how I was doing it wrong and that I should follow his exact methods. I found his tone really frustrating, especially since I’ve been doing this long enough to know how to arrange things effectively.

As the day went on, Dave started to micromanage me, hovering around, making snide remarks about how if things weren't done his way, they'd look unprofessional. I snapped and told him that I was capable of doing my job without his constant interference. He got defensive and we ended up arguing in front of other coworkers.

In a bid to prove a point, I decided that I would deliberately take my time stocking to show him that I didn’t need his approval. I started rearranging the fruits and vegetables in a way I thought looked artistic, even if it wasn’t the most practical layout. When it came time for the store to open, things were still a mess, and customers were complaining about not being able to find what they needed.

By the end of the shift, both of us were upset and the store manager had to step in to mediate our argument. Dave said I wasted everyone’s time, and I told him he should have left me alone to do my job. Now, I feel guilty for escalating things and creating a hostile work environment, but I also think he could have respected my ability to work independently.

AITA for trying to teach him a lesson about respect, or were we both just in the wrong?",859,1028,0.65,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_91991,2019-01-02 00:00:00,ESH,1892,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"About six months ago, my brother had a birthday party, and my family decided to do a surprise barbecue for him at our parents' house. My brother is a really laid-back guy and loves casual gatherings, so my parents planned a pretty simple affair, inviting close friends and family. 

My sister-in-law, on the other hand, is a bit more high-strung and likes to throw “perfect” parties. She insisted on handling the decorations and food, claiming that she could elevate the event. While I wanted to keep things simple, I didn't want to cause any friction, so I agreed to let her take the lead, thinking it would make her happy.

However, as the day approached, it became clear that my sister-in-law was getting more and more stressed. She began making changes to the plan without consulting anyone, adding a fancy cake, expensive hors d'oeuvres, and even a photo booth, which felt out of place for a casual gathering. I thought it was getting ridiculous, but I held my tongue to avoid any drama.

When the day of the party arrived, my brother was genuinely surprised and grateful for the effort. But during the party, my sister-in-law started to complain about the lack of “appreciation” for her hard work, which put everyone in an awkward position. I could see my brother trying to keep the mood light, but it became tense when she insisted that everyone take formal photos for her Instagram.

In a moment of frustration, I bluntly told her that it was ridiculous to turn a laid-back celebration into a commercial event and that nobody was there for the photo op. This led to a heated argument between us, and I ended up saying some hurtful things about her need for validation and how she always needed everything to be perfect. 

My brother tried to mediate, but it was too late; she stormed off, and we ended up ruining what was supposed to be a fun day. I felt guilty afterward for escalating it, but I also felt like she was being unreasonable about the whole situation. Now it's created a rift in the family, and we haven't been able to have a civil conversation since. 

Looking back, I see we both contributed to the chaos: her by pushing for something more than what the day called for, and me by not speaking up sooner and then exploding.

Their parents let them run wild, and while I understand kids need to play, I was pretty upset to see my hard work damaged. I didn’t say anything at first, but when I saw the kids doing it again, I yelled at them to stay away from my garden and told them they were being disrespectful.

The parents overheard me and came over, and instead of apologizing, they confronted me, saying I was being too harsh and that kids will be kids.

I didn't think it would affect our friendship, but Jake seemed distant after that. I tried to support him, but every time I brought it up, he brushed it off and changed the subject.

Last week, we attended a mutual friend's birthday party, and I noticed Jake was particularly withdrawn. When I tried to talk to him, he snapped at me, saying I shouldn't be so smug about my promotion. I was taken aback and told him I didn’t mean to rub it in his face. But instead of calming down, he got even angrier, accusing me of not understanding his struggles and being insensitive.

Feeling frustrated, I responded, “Maybe if you worked harder, you would have gotten the promotion too!” That was a low blow, and I regretted saying it almost immediately. He stormed off, and I spent the rest of the night feeling guilty about it.

The next day, I reached out to apologize, but he refused to talk to me. Days passed, and I tried to give him space, but I could tell he was still upset. Then, I overheard him talking to our other friends, and he was saying how he couldn’t believe I would throw my success in his face like that.

Feeling hurt and frustrated, I texted him, “I didn’t mean to upset you, but you’ve been acting like a jerk ever since my promotion. Maybe you need to get over it.” That led to a huge argument over text, with both of us saying things we didn’t mean. He accused me of being arrogant, and I called him a sore loser.

Everyone sucks here,"I (27F) recently had a situation with my brother (24M) and his girlfriend (23F) that has left me feeling conflicted. 

For some background, my brother and I grew up in a pretty rough environment. Our parents were always fighting, and we had to fend for ourselves a lot. Because of that, I’ve always had a protective instinct over him. As we grew older, I moved out to go to college and build a life for myself, but I always tried to be there for him whenever he needed me. 

My brother started dating his girlfriend about a year ago. At first, I thought she was great. She seemed nice, and they genuinely looked happy together. However, over time, I've noticed some red flags. She can be pretty controlling and often insults my brother, even if it's in a joking manner. I’ve seen her belittle him in front of friends and family, and it makes me uncomfortable. 

A few weeks ago, my brother invited me over for dinner, and his girlfriend was there. During the meal, she kept making sarcastic comments at my brother’s expense, which I finally decided to call her out on. I told her that she needs to stop putting him down, even if she thinks it’s harmless. She laughed it off but then turned it into a big deal, claiming I was trying to ruin the mood. My brother looked uncomfortable but didn’t defend me or say anything to her. 

After dinner, my brother told me that I was being too harsh and that it was just how they communicated. I was frustrated and told him that I just wanted him to see how unhealthy their relationship was becoming. He ended up getting angry with me and said I was overstepping my boundaries. 

I felt bad for calling her out, but I genuinely believe she’s not good for him. I’ve been reflecting on whether I should have just kept my mouth shut or if I was right to try to protect him.

Everyone sucks here,"So here's my story:

A few weeks ago, my friends and I decided to have a game night at my place. We were all excited. I set up the snacks, drinks, and the board games. Everything was going smoothly until my friend Mike, who can be a bit competitive, showed up with his girlfriend, Sarah. 

Sarah had a reputation for being overly dramatic, and I knew that she didn't handle losing well. During the first game, we chose a strategy-based board game, and it didn’t take long for tensions to rise. Mike and Sarah started bickering over trivial moves, and I tried to lighten the mood by cracking jokes and encouraging everyone to keep it friendly. 

During the second game, things escalated. Mike was frustrated with Sarah's gameplay, and he made a snarky remark about her strategy. Sarah, in turn, snapped back at him, and that’s when I decided to intervene. I told them both to chill out and that it was just a game. That really set Sarah off. She accused me of taking sides and said I was being rude to her. I didn’t think I was being rude; I was just trying to keep the peace.

Feeling a bit attacked, I raised my voice, saying that we were all here to have fun, not to fight. At that point, the atmosphere became really tense. Mike jumped in and defended me, but Sarah started crying and left the room. Mike followed her, trying to smooth things over. 

While they were gone, the rest of us were awkwardly silent, and I felt bad for how things had spiraled out of control. When they returned, Sarah was still upset and refused to play any more games. The night ended pretty sourly with her saying she didn’t want to come back to my place again.

Now I’m left wondering if I was too harsh in trying to diffuse the situation, or if I should have just let them argue it out. AITA for stepping in and trying to stop the argument, or should I have stayed out of it?",304,1408,0.59,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_89565,2024-08-14 00:00:00,ESH,1860,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Last weekend, my friends and I decided to hit up a local café that has been getting a lot of buzz on social media. It was a nice place, but it was packed, and we had to wait a while to find a table. While we were waiting, I overheard a loud group at a nearby table making some pretty edgy jokes. One of the guys in that group, who seemed particularly obnoxious, kept making jokes that crossed the line into being inappropriate, especially towards a couple of women seated next to them.

I was irritated by this guy's behavior, so when he made another crude joke, I decided to interject. I called him out and told him that his jokes were not funny and that he should have more respect for the people around him. He turned to me, smirked, and said, ""Oh, lighten up! It’s just a joke, are you really that sensitive?"" This only fueled my irritation, and I found myself getting more aggressive. I told him that his sense of humor was trash and that he probably did this all the time to compensate for his lack of personality.

At this point, he got defensive and started arguing back, insisting that comedy is subjective and that I was overreacting. The situation escalated, and we ended up having a shouting match in the café. My friends were visibly uncomfortable, and a few other patrons looked over, clearly shocked at our confrontation.

Eventually, the café staff came over to diffuse the situation, asking us to calm down or consider leaving. I realized that I had let my annoyance get the best of me and I felt ashamed, but I also felt justified in standing up against someone being disrespectful. However, as we left the café, I couldn't help but feel that I overstepped and that my reaction might have been just as annoying as his original behavior.

As the night went on, Sarah and I were both getting a little tipsy, and we started joking around, playfully teasing each other. At one point, I started to talk about how I had a crush on a guy from our friend group (let's call him Mike, 23M). Sarah, in a joking manner, encouraged me to flirt with him, saying I should go for it. So, I decided to take her advice and approached Mike.

We started chatting, and things were going well. I was feeling confident, and I decided to lean in and give him a kiss. However, I didn't realize that Sarah was watching and didn’t take it too well. After the kiss, she pulled me aside and confronted me. She told me that she was actually interested in Mike and felt betrayed because I went for him without checking in with her first.

I genuinely didn’t know she liked him; she never mentioned it to me. I apologized, but she was really upset and said I should’ve respected her feelings. In the heat of the moment, I snapped back and told her she shouldn't have encouraged me if she was interested in him. We ended up getting into a heated argument in front of others, which made things super awkward.

Now, we’re not talking, and I feel bad for how everything went down. I know I should’ve been more aware of her feelings, but I also feel like she shouldn’t have encouraged me to flirt if she had feelings for him.

In a moment of anger, I snapped back, saying that if she wanted to be with someone who treats her poorly, that was her choice, but she shouldn't expect me to pretend to like him. That turned our gathering into an awkward tension-filled affair, and Sarah ended up in tears. 

I later realized that I should have approached the situation with more empathy instead of frustration. I just knew how much she had suffered, and I thought I was helping her see that she was worth more. But I also could have been more supportive rather than critical at such a sensitive time.

Later on, after some drinks, I jokingly said, “So, how does it feel to be a corporate sellout?” I thought it was funny, but he got really defensive and started saying that he worked hard for his success. And then Sarah jumped in, saying I was ruining her wedding reception with my negativity.

I felt really bad because that wasn’t my intention at all. To be honest, I was just trying to be funny, but I also know I can be a bit blunt sometimes. I apologized to Sarah, but she was still upset.

I’ve mentioned it before, but he always brushes it off, saying he’ll get to it when he can.

Last week, after noticing the sink was overflowing with his dirty dishes yet again, I snapped a little. I was tired of trying to be patient. I told him that it was really frustrating living with someone who can’t take a few minutes to clean up after himself. I went on to say something like, “It’s really not that hard; it makes you look lazy, honestly.” 

That comment did not go over well. He got defensive and claimed that I was being unreasonable considering how stressed he was. He said I should be more understanding and that everyone has their limits. I felt bad, but I was also annoyed that he couldn’t take any responsibility.

Now there’s this weird tension between us. We’re not talking as much, and I feel like I’ve crossed a line, but I also think he needed to hear it. 

So, AITA for calling him out on his mess when he’s stressed? Am I the asshole for losing my temper?",624,2583,0.54,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_20403,2024-01-26 00:00:00,ESH,1373,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Some background: I've been dealing with a lot of personal issues lately, including stress from work and a family member's recent illness. It's been overwhelming, and my mental health has taken a hit. I have a close friend, Alex, who I confide in about these struggles. 

Last week, after a particularly difficult day, I invited Alex over for comfort. We ended up drinking a bit and, in a vulnerable moment, I shared some things I probably shouldn't have about my feelings for him. I’ve always seen him as just a friend, but in that moment, I let my guard down and kissed him. It felt nice at the time, but I didn't really think it through. 

The next day, I felt regretful and confused about what had happened. I told Alex I wasn’t ready for anything more than friendship and that I didn't want to complicate things, especially given my current state. He seemed hurt and angry, saying I led him on and made him think there was a chance for more. 

Now things are awkward between us. I feel guilty for what happened, but also frustrated that he reacted so strongly when I was just being honest about my feelings. We both said things we didn't mean during our conversations, and now we’re not speaking. 

Am I the asshole for kissing him when I wasn’t really ready for more? Did I lead him on? Should I have kept my feelings to myself?",774,1366,0.73,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_66050,2020-01-30 00:00:00,ESH,1333,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I (30M) recently had a pretty awkward situation with my neighbor (28F) that left me questioning whether I handled things poorly. So, I live in a small apartment complex, and I've had a pretty friendly relationship with my neighbors. We chat occasionally, but I wouldn’t say we’re close friends. 

A couple of weeks ago, my neighbor knocked on my door late at night. I opened it, and she looked really distressed. She told me that she had just had a huge fight with her boyfriend, and she needed someone to talk to. I felt bad for her, so I invited her in. We ended up talking for a couple of hours, and during that time, she got pretty emotional and started crying. It was a bit awkward for me, but I tried to be supportive.

At one point, she asked if she could crash on my couch for the night since she didn't want to go back to her apartment alone. I hesitated but agreed, thinking it was just a friendly gesture. I set up the couch for her and went to bed in my room. 

The next morning, when I woke up, I found her still on the couch, and she seemed a bit different—more flirty than before. We talked a bit more, and she mentioned that she really appreciated me being there for her. I kind of brushed it off, thinking she was just emotional from the fight.

Later that day, she texted me and suggested we hang out more often, maybe grab dinner or something. I didn't think much of it at first, but she continued to text me, and I started feeling uncomfortable. I didn’t want to lead her on or give her the wrong idea, so I decided to tell her that I thought it might be best if we kept things friendly and not cross any boundaries.

Well, that didn’t go over well. She got upset and accused me of being insensitive to her feelings and not understanding what she was going through. I tried to explain that I was just trying to be respectful, but she ended up saying some pretty hurtful things about me being a bad neighbor.

Now I'm feeling confused. I wanted to be supportive, but I also didn’t want to give her the impression that I was interested in her romantically. I think I handled the situation poorly by not setting boundaries sooner, and now it feels like it has affected our relationship as neighbors.

AITA for trying to keep things friendly and not wanting to complicate the situation further? I never intended to upset her, but I also don’t want to get involved in a messy situation.",508,1683,0.85,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_36756,2021-10-25 00:00:00,ESH,2401,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I recently had an argument that escalated over something I thought was trivial but apparently wasn’t. We've been living together for about two years, and I noticed that my partner tends to leave the bathroom in disarray after getting ready in the morning. I appreciate that we both have our routines, but it seems like the whole space gets chaotic with towels on the floor, makeup everywhere, and the sink often left with water and hair products.

I decided to bring it up in a light-hearted manner one day, suggesting we could work together to keep the bathroom tidy. I mentioned how much nicer it would be for both of us to have a clean and organized space. Instead of taking it well, my partner interpreted it as me nitpicking and criticizing their habits. They snapped back and said I was being controlling and that I shouldn’t act like I’m their mother.

Feeling hurt and misunderstood, I tried to explain that I was just looking for a compromise and offered to come up with a cleaning schedule together. I thought it might help if we both had a clear idea of what needed to be done. My partner, however, took offense to this as well, saying they didn’t want to be told how to clean or live their life. The conversation quickly turned into a heated argument, where we both ended up saying things we didn’t mean.

In the heat of the moment, I might have raised my voice and said something along the lines of, “You never take this seriously!” which I regret because it only escalated the situation. The argument left both of us feeling resentful, and now there’s this lingering tension whenever we talk about chores.

So, I can’t help but wonder if I crossed a line here. AITA for trying to address the mess in the bathroom, or did I go too far in how I handled it?

Everyone sucks here,"I recently went to a friend's housewarming party and was excited to catch up with everyone. I knew a few people there but not all, but it was a relaxed atmosphere. During the party, I ended up chatting with a couple of people about our jobs and hobbies. One guy, let’s call him Mark, really started getting on my nerves. He was overly critical of everyone’s career choices, including mine, which I found quite rude.

At one point, he made a snide comment about my job being “pointless” and suggested I should be doing something “more meaningful.” I tried to brush it off, but it really bothered me. I retaliated by making a sarcastic remark about his job, saying something like, “Well, at least my job pays the bills, unlike whatever you do.” We both laughed, but it was tense, and I could feel the mood shift.

As the night went on, Mark continued to make passive-aggressive comments, and I couldn't hold back anymore. I made a joke about his outfit, calling it “preppy in a bad way,” which honestly wasn’t even a clever insult, but it felt good to let off some steam. He looked genuinely hurt, and a couple of other guests seemed uncomfortable.

After that, I felt pretty bad about the whole thing and tried to apologize to him, but he brushed me off and said he didn't want to talk to someone who made fun of his clothing. I ended up leaving the party feeling mixed about the whole situation. My friend later texted me and said I should have let it go instead of escalating it, but I was just so annoyed by Mark's attitude.

Everyone sucks here,"Last weekend, I went to a friend's birthday party at his apartment. It was a small gathering with about ten people, and we were all having a good time, chatting and enjoying some drinks. As the night went on, a couple of people started playing a game in the living room that involved a lot of shouting and laughter. It was all in good fun, but it quickly became a bit chaotic.

At one point, I was sitting on the couch, trying to enjoy my drink and catch up with another friend. However, the noise from the game was getting louder, and I found it really hard to concentrate on our conversation. It was also starting to give me a headache. After a while, I lost my patience and yelled out, asking them to keep it down a bit because I was trying to talk.

The room fell silent for a moment, and the people playing the game looked stunned. One of the players, who I think was just trying to enjoy the birthday celebration, shot me a glare and said, ""We're just having fun, no need to ruin it for everyone!"" I felt embarrassed, but I also thought I had a right to enjoy the party without a headache.

My friend whose birthday it was awkwardly tried to mediate by suggesting we could take the game to another room. Some people agreed, but others were clearly upset. I ended up feeling bad for interrupting their fun, but I also wished they had considered the people who weren’t playing.

After some tension, the group moved to another room, but the vibe had definitely shifted. My friend later told me that I should have just dealt with it instead of making a scene. I felt like everyone could have handled the situation better, but I also regretted yelling.

Everyone sucks here,"23F here, sharing an apartment with two roommates, both of whom are really nice people. The issue comes down to our shared living space, particularly the kitchen. I’ve always been a bit particular about cleanliness, but I understand that everyone has different standards. At first, I tried to keep my opinions to myself and just clean up after myself, but it’s become increasingly frustrating.

One of my roommates, Sarah, is a great cook but doesn’t clean up after herself very well. She often leaves dirty dishes piled up in the sink, food crumbs on the counters, and spills on the floor. I’ve tried to address it gently by mentioning it in passing, but it seemed to fall on deaf ears. I even sent a group message one day, suggesting we all pitch in for a chore chart to keep the kitchen tidy, but that didn’t get much response either.

After a few weeks of this, I finally snapped. One night, I came home to find the kitchen in complete disarray. There were dishes piled up, food all over the counters, and it smelled like something had gone bad in the fridge. I lost my cool and sent a very blunt message to both my roommates, expressing my frustration and saying that it was “disgusting” and “completely unacceptable.”

In hindsight, I realize that the way I approached it was pretty harsh. Instead of creating a constructive atmosphere, I just fueled negativity. My other roommate, Jenna, who usually keeps things tidy, felt caught in the middle and didn’t appreciate my tone either. She opened up about feeling overwhelmed by the situation and how my message made her feel attacked, which I hadn’t intended at all.

Now, there’s tension in our apartment. I’ve tried to apologize, but both Sarah and Jenna have been a bit distant since my outburst.

So, I recently had a situation that left me wondering if I handled it poorly. A few weeks ago, I was at my friend Jess's birthday party. Jess has a pretty small apartment, and there were about 15 people crammed in there. The atmosphere was lively, and everyone was having a good time.

As the night went on, Jess's roommate, Mike, who tends to be a bit of a stickler for rules, started getting annoyed with the noise levels. He came out a couple of times to ask us to keep it down. I totally get it; he was trying to have a quiet evening, but it felt like he was being overly dramatic about it.

At one point, Mike snapped and told us to ""shut up"" if we wanted to stay in the apartment. I felt that was really rude, especially since it was Jess's party. I was a bit tipsy and decided to retaliate. I told him that if he wanted us to be quiet, he should have stayed in his room instead of coming out to ruin the fun. This led to a bit of a shouting match between us, where I was saying he was being a buzzkill and he called me disrespectful.

Eventually, Jess had to step in to calm things down, but the atmosphere was really tense after that. I felt justified for standing up to Mike, but looking back, I realize I could have handled it better. I might have escalated the situation instead of trying to find a compromise.

Everyone sucks here,"So here’s the situation. My sister (29F) and I (26F) have always had a somewhat competitive relationship. We grew up in a household where our parents often compared us, so we’ve kind of carried that into adulthood. 

Last month, I planned a surprise birthday party for my best friend. I put a lot of effort into it, coordinating with mutual friends, booking a venue, and even arranging for a live band. The night before the party, my sister casually mentioned that she was planning to announce her pregnancy at a family dinner the following week, right after my best friend’s party. I didn’t think much of it at the time.

The day of the party, my sister showed up uninvited (she wasn’t really invited because I wanted it to be just close friends). She brought a cake with her that said “Auntie [Sister’s Name]” on it and made a big deal about how she was pregnant. The attention immediately shifted from my friend to her and her news, and it felt like I had worked so hard for the party only to have it stolen right from under me.

I was upset and confronted her. I told her that she always has to make everything about her, and that she was being selfish for showing up with that cake at my friend’s party. We got into a heated argument, and I may have said some harsh things about how she’s always needed to be the center of attention. I felt justified in being upset, but I also realized that I might have overreacted.

Afterward, our parents got involved, each taking sides. My mom said I should have been more understanding, while my dad agreed with me that my sister was being inconsiderate. 

So, AITA for getting really angry at my sister for stealing my friend’s moment in the spotlight? I feel like we both acted poorly, but I just wanted to celebrate my friend.",203,2634,0.68,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_12441,2021-12-10 00:00:00,ESH,1773,AITA

But then I began getting messages from friends of this ""Jordan,"" asking why I hadn’t responded to their invites or why I was ignoring them. It was getting frustrating, and I realized that I had somehow been mistaken for this person.

I did some digging and found out that there was a ""Jordan"" who lived in my city, had a very similar last name, and had published a few articles online. It was clear that people were confusing us. After a couple of weeks of this, I decided to take action. 

I sent a polite message to a couple of the people who had contacted me, explaining that I wasn’t ""Jordan"" and that they should reach out to the correct person. Most replied with apologies, but one guy, who seemed particularly insistent, snapped back at me, accusing me of lying and that I was just trying to ghost him. I was annoyed but tried to remain civil.

After that, I got an idea. I created a fake social media account using a photo of an actor and the name ""Jordan.""

Everyone sucks here,"I went to a cafe with some friends to grab coffee and catch up. While we were there, I noticed a woman at the next table who was clearly having a loud argument on her phone. She was using a lot of profanity and raising her voice, and it was disrupting the peaceful atmosphere of the cafe. I found it really annoying, especially because we were trying to talk and enjoy our time together.

After about ten minutes of this, I decided to say something. I leaned over and politely asked her if she could take the call outside, explaining that it was quite loud and distracting. She snapped back at me, saying it was none of my business and to mind my own. I felt frustrated because I thought I was just trying to be considerate to everyone in the cafe.

In response, I got upset and raised my voice, telling her that she was being incredibly rude and that other people were trying to enjoy their time. It turned into a bit of a scene, and I could feel the eyes of other patrons on us. Eventually, she hung up and left the cafe, but I felt bad for escalating things and making such a public fuss.

My friends were split on the situation. Some said I was right to speak up, while others felt I overstepped.

Everyone sucks here,"I have a friend, let's call him Jake, who is really into fitness and health. We’ve been friends for years, and I appreciate him for his enthusiasm. However, lately, he’s been a bit overbearing about it. He constantly talks about his workout routines, meal prep, and how everyone should be eating clean and exercising more. I get it; he’s passionate about his lifestyle, but it’s becoming exhausting to hear about all the time.

Recently, I hosted a small gathering at my place with a few friends, including Jake. I wanted it to be a relaxed, fun evening, so I prepared some snacks and ordered pizza. I knew Jake would probably have a lot to say about my food choices, but I didn’t expect him to be so vocal about it during the gathering.

As soon as Jake arrived, he started criticizing the food. He pointed out the high calories in the pizza and said my chips were unhealthy. I tried to lighten the mood by joking that it was a cheat day, but he just kept going. At one point, he even suggested that I should have had a salad instead and started talking about how great his meal prep was. It felt really awkward, and I could tell my other friends were uncomfortable too.

In the heat of the moment, I snapped and told him he was being a buzzkill and that not everyone wants to hear about his fitness regime all the time. I felt bad afterward because I know he meant well, but I was frustrated. Jake didn't take it well either; he got defensive and told me I was being rude for not wanting to take care of my health. He stormed out, and the vibe of the night was ruined.

Now I feel guilty for snapping at him, but I also think he needs to learn when to back off. Everyone should be able to enjoy a night without being lectured about their choices. I’m not sure who’s in the wrong here, but I guess we both could have handled things better.",806,2867,0.9,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_20787,2023-11-08 00:00:00,ESH,1840,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Hey everyone,

I recently had a pretty heated argument with my coworker, Sarah. We were working on a group project together, and I noticed that she was consistently late with her contributions. I brought it up in a team meeting, saying, ""Sarah, we really need your part to stay on schedule.""

She snapped back and said, ""Maybe if you weren’t so controlling, I wouldn’t have to rush."" I was taken aback and replied, ""I’m not controlling; I’m just trying to keep the project on track.""

After the meeting, I sent her a message saying, ""You really need to step up your game; I can't do everything for you."" I realize that it might have come off a bit harsh, but I was frustrated because I was putting in a lot of effort and felt like she wasn’t pulling her weight.

To make matters worse, I later found out that Sarah was dealing with some personal issues that were affecting her work. I felt guilty that I hadn’t considered her situation before confronting her. 

So now I’m wondering, was I the asshole here for calling her out in front of the team and sending that message, or was she being unreasonable by not communicating her struggles with the group?

I’ve always had a strained relationship with my stepmom; she’s very controlling and often tries to dictate how I should live my life. For instance, she keeps telling me to apply for jobs that I’m not interested in and insists on picking out my clothes when we go shopping together.

Things came to a head when she announced she was going to throw a family dinner and wanted to invite some of her friends. She insisted I dress in a way that she deemed appropriate, which included a dress I absolutely hated. I told her I wasn’t going to wear it and that I’d choose my own outfit. She got really upset and said I was being disrespectful to her and her friends.

In retaliation, I decided to wear the most ridiculous outfit I could find in my closet—an old Halloween costume that was way too small and completely silly. When I showed up to the dinner, she was furious and embarrassed in front of her friends. I know I shouldn't have done that, but I was so frustrated with her constant control over my life.

My dad just sat there awkwardly, not taking sides, which made me feel unsupported. Afterward, my stepmom yelled at me for ruining the evening, and I argued back that she was the one making it unbearable in the first place.

Everyone sucks here,"I want to start by saying that I’m not against my roommate having friends over, but I feel like I may have overreacted recently. My roommate, Sarah, and I have been living together for over a year. We generally get along well, but there's been a bit of tension lately.

A few weeks ago, Sarah started seeing a new boyfriend, and it feels like he’s over almost every other night. At first, I was okay with it, but it quickly became a problem for me. He’s nice enough, but he tends to take over the common areas, leaving a mess behind. I’ve mentioned it to Sarah a couple of times, asking her to remind him to clean up after himself, but nothing changed.

Last Friday, I came home after a long day at work, and I found the living room a complete disaster. There were snack wrappers everywhere, dirty dishes piled up in the sink, and they had left the TV on at full volume. I was exhausted and just wanted some peace, but instead, I walked into chaos.

I snapped and told Sarah I couldn’t deal with it anymore. I said I needed her to limit the time he spent at our place because I didn’t want to live in a pigsty. She was upset and said I was being unfair and overbearing. She argued that it was her boyfriend and she should be able to have him over whenever she wants. I countered that as my roommate, she should be considerate about how his presence impacts our shared space.

In hindsight, I realize I could have approached it differently, maybe suggesting we set some ground rules together instead of just demanding changes. But I was frustrated and overwhelmed. Sarah ended up crying, and now there’s this awkward tension between us. 

We both have our faults here. I didn’t manage my frustration well, and maybe I should have been more understanding of her excitement about her new relationship. But I also think she needs to acknowledge the shared living space and not let it turn into a mess.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I (22F) have a younger brother, Jake (17M), who has been struggling with his mental health for a while. I care about him deeply and want to help, but he’s been really resistant to any kind of support. He refuses to go to therapy and often shuts me out when I try to talk to him about his feelings. 

Recently, I found out that he’s been skipping school and spending time with a group of kids who I know have a bad influence on him. I’ve tried talking to our parents about it, but they just brush it off and say he’s a teenager and it’s normal behavior. It’s frustrating because I see him heading down a path that could ruin his future.

In an attempt to get through to him, I decided to take a more drastic approach. One morning, I went into his room while he was still sleeping and started blasting music at full volume. He woke up furious and yelled at me, but I told him I was just trying to help him get up and be productive. I also followed up with some tough love and told him that he needs to stop hanging out with those friends and start taking his life seriously. 

He ended up storming out of the house and hasn’t talked to me since. My parents found out and were furious with me, saying I overstepped my boundaries and that I should have respected his space. Now, they’re mad at both of us and it feels like I’m being blamed for everything.

As the night went on, I tried to engage with everyone, but the conversations felt forced. At one point, I overheard Sarah telling a funny story about me from our college days, but she exaggerated some details that made me look really silly. I felt embarrassed and decided to intervene, so I jokingly called her out on it, saying, “Wow, Sarah, that’s such a stretch! I didn’t even do that!” 

The mood shifted a bit, and Sarah looked hurt. I realized I might have ruined the moment for her. Instead of apologizing, I got defensive and said that it wasn’t fair for her to poke fun at me in front of her new friends. 

After that, the vibe at the party was awkward, and a few guests even quietly left. I ended up leaving shortly after, feeling upset. Sarah texted me later that night, saying I made her feel bad on her birthday and that I should have just let her have her fun.

So, my neighbor and I have had a somewhat rocky relationship. He tends to blast music late at night, which often keeps me and my family awake. I've spoken to him about it before, and he always promises to keep it down, but it never lasts long. One night, I was exhausted after a long week at work, and his music was particularly loud. I decided I had enough and went over to knock on his door at around midnight.

He opened the door, clearly annoyed, and I tried to stay calm. I told him that it was too loud, and that I needed to get some sleep. Instead of apologizing or even acknowledging the issue, he snapped and said I should just ""deal with it"" because he had a right to enjoy his music. I lost my temper and told him he was being selfish and that he should show some consideration for his neighbors. 

Things escalated, and I ended up saying some pretty harsh things about his taste in music and how he was a terrible neighbor. He shouted back that I was uptight and needed to lighten up. Eventually, I stormed off, feeling guilty for losing my cool but also frustrated that he wasn’t respecting my request.

The next day, I felt bad about how I handled things and thought about apologizing, but then I remembered how many times I’d already tried to be civil with him. I decided against it.

One evening, Sarah invited a few of our mutual friends over for a small get-together to celebrate her anniversary with Mike, who I still hadn’t met. When I arrived, I noticed that Sarah had put a lot of effort into the evening, complete with decorations and a special cake. I thought it was sweet.

As the night went on, I felt a little out of place since everyone else was already familiar with Mike. I tried to engage in conversations, but I could tell that Sarah was mostly focused on Mike and didn’t give me much attention. Feeling neglected, I started to drink a little more than I usually would, hoping to loosen up and join in the fun.

At one point, I made a joke about how I was the ""third wheel"" and ended up making a comment about how Sarah could do better than Mike, thinking it was all in good fun. The atmosphere changed instantly. Sarah looked hurt, and Mike seemed taken aback.

Everyone sucks here,"I recently hosted a game night at my apartment and invited a group of friends, including my roommate, Jake. Jake has a girlfriend, Mia, who is notoriously picky about food. She's gluten-free and also avoids a bunch of other things, but since I wanted everyone to have a good time, I decided to prepare a variety of snacks to accommodate her dietary restrictions.

I went out of my way to get gluten-free chips, salsa, a veggie platter, and I even made a large gluten-free pizza. I spent around $80 total, mostly on the gluten-free ingredients because they can be pricey.

The night of the game night arrives, and I’m excited to see everyone enjoying the snacks. But as Mia shows up, she immediately starts complaining about the food. She takes one look at the pizza and declares it ""not really her thing,"" then picks at the veggie platter, saying she doesn't like raw vegetables. Instead, she pulls out a massive bag of gluten-free cookies she brought for herself and starts munching on those while telling everyone that they should try them because they are ""so much better"" than what I made.

I felt a bit hurt but tried to brush it off. However, as the night goes on, Mia continues to dismiss the food I prepared, making snide comments about it being ""not good enough"" for her standards. At one point, I jokingly told her that if she liked her cookies so much, she should just bring her own food from now on. She took that personally and got upset, saying I was being rude.

Later, when everyone was leaving, I jokingly suggested that Mia should leave the leftover cookies as a thank-you for my efforts, since she barely touched anything else. Instead of laughing it off, she got defensive and said she brought the cookies for herself and didn’t owe me anything. I rolled my eyes and told her it was only fair since I catered to her needs all night.

Jake ended up getting annoyed with both of us and said we were acting childish. I felt justified because I spent a lot of time and money accommodating her, while Mia felt I was being a jerk for trying to make her feel guilty.

I’m part of a close-knit group of friends, and we often hang out together and plan trips. Last summer, we decided to go on a weekend camping trip. I was really looking forward to it, but about a week before we were set to leave, one of my friends, Sarah, mentioned that she was thinking of bringing her new boyfriend, who I had never met. 

I wasn’t super thrilled about it because our trips usually have a certain vibe, and I was worried a new person would change that. I voiced my concerns to a couple of friends, saying I felt it might be awkward. Some agreed with me, but others thought I was being unreasonable and that Sarah should be able to bring whoever she wants.

Despite my reservations, I didn’t say anything to Sarah directly. When we got to the campsite, it became clear that this guy, Tom, didn’t really blend in with our group. He was loud, made a lot of off-color jokes, and seemed to want to dominate every conversation. I found myself feeling increasingly annoyed as the weekend went on. 

On the second night, after a few drinks, I snapped and told Tom that he needed to tone it down and stop trying so hard to be the center of attention. He got defensive, and an argument broke out. Sarah jumped in, clearly upset that I had called out her boyfriend in front of everyone. Things escalated, and I ended up saying that maybe if she had chosen better, we wouldn’t be in this situation.

We were reading a book that had some controversial themes, and during our last meeting, I made a comment about how I didn’t think the author did a good job addressing some of the sensitive topics. I jokingly said, ""Well, if I was writing this book, I would have done it better,"" intending it to be lighthearted. A couple of people laughed, but one member, let’s call her Lisa, seemed really offended and immediately called me out.

Instead of just brushing it off, I snapped back and said something along the lines of, ""If you can't handle criticism of a book, maybe you shouldn't be in a book club."" I felt like I was defending my opinion, but looking back, I realize my tone was pretty harsh.

Lisa then threw back that I was being elitist and that my opinion didn't matter more than anyone else's. This escalated into a back-and-forth where we both ended up speaking over each other, and I could feel the tension in the room. By the end of the meeting, several members were visibly uncomfortable, and I could tell that I had crossed a line.

We arrive at the restaurant and are seated. Our server greets us and starts taking drink orders. My boyfriend, who can be a bit verbose, starts talking about some random sports event he watched last week. I’m seated next to him, and I’m not really in the mood to talk, so I just nod along while he goes on and on.

Boyfriend: “Umm, hold on, I’m still thinking.”

Me: “You had time to look at the menu while you were talking.”

He looks at me, clearly annoyed, and says, “I was just trying to make conversation!” The server looks a bit uncomfortable.

Instead of just apologizing, they got defensive and argued that I was overreacting and that I shouldn’t expect perfection all the time.

In retaliation, I decided to stop cleaning the bathroom completely, figuring that if they had to live in it, maybe they’d finally understand how frustrating it was. They were clearly annoyed by the mess, but I felt justified in my actions since I had expressed my feelings multiple times.

Now we’re both living in a messy bathroom, and it’s causing tension between us. I realize that I probably should have approached the situation differently instead of punishing my partner, but I also feel like they should take my concerns seriously. We're both feeling frustrated, and I’m not sure how to fix this. So Reddit, am I the asshole for refusing to clean up after my partner to prove a point, or are we both just being unreasonable?",805,1660,0.87,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_14839,2019-07-23 00:00:00,ESH,1798,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Hello everyone,

I (28F) have a close-knit group of friends that I've known since high school. Among them is Sarah (27F), who has always been the life of the party. She's charming, funny, and we’ve had countless great memories together. The thing is, Sarah has been struggling with alcohol for a while now. She's been in and out of rehab, and it’s affected her relationships and her job. Despite this, she often insists that she’s fine and still wants to hang out and party like old times.

Recently, our friend group decided to throw a surprise birthday party for another friend, Mark (28M). We wanted it to be a fun night, but we also knew that Sarah would want to drink heavily, which we all felt could lead to trouble given her current state. The last time she drank heavily, she ended up having a blackout and caused a scene, which embarrassed her and worried all of us.

I felt it was necessary to address this, so I talked to our friend group and suggested we ask Sarah to stay sober for the night. Most of my friends agreed, but a couple thought it was unfair and that we should let her make her own choices. After some debate, we decided to have a chat with her, expressing our concerns but ultimately leaving the decision up to her.

When we told Sarah about the party and our suggestion, she was furious. She said we were trying to control her life and that she didn’t need anyone telling her how to live. I tried to explain that it was out of concern, but she felt attacked and accused me of being judgmental. She stormed out of the conversation, and the whole situation turned awkward.

The night of the party arrived, and I couldn’t help but feel guilty. We had made arrangements for a fun night without heavy drinking, but I was still unsure if we handled it the right way. During the party, Sarah showed up anyway, and she didn't take it well when she saw that everyone was committed to having fun without alcohol. She ended up getting upset, and the mood shifted. We all tried to keep things light, but Sarah picked a fight with me over my “interference” in her life.

In the end, the party ended on a sour note. Some friends blamed me for how things turned out, saying we shouldn't have brought it up with her at all, while others felt that I did the right thing by looking out for her. I’m left wondering if I overstepped by trying to protect her or if she was overreacting.

So, AITA for trying to protect my friend from herself?",193,534,0.98,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_71746,2024-07-11 00:00:00,ESH,2449,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My friend and I have been close for years, and we often share personal stories and experiences. Recently, she confided in me about a terrible fight she had with her boyfriend, where he said some really hurtful things. I felt really bad for her and wanted to support her, so I encouraged her to vent about it and suggested she might want to consider breaking up with him.

A few days later, she seemed to be in a better mood and had decided to forgive him. However, I couldn't shake the feeling that he didn't deserve her forgiveness after what he said. So, in a moment of poor judgment, I shared some screenshots of our conversations with another mutual friend, thinking it might help them understand why she was upset and encourage her to stand her ground.

When my friend found out, she was furious. She felt betrayed that I shared her private feelings and discussions without her permission. I apologized, but I still think she should have listened to my advice instead of taking him back.

Now, I’m wondering if I was in the wrong for sharing her story, or if she’s overreacting by being mad at me. Am I the asshole for trying to look out for her but crossing a line in the process?",674,1733,0.81,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_44069,2019-05-18 00:00:00,ESH,1186,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Last weekend, I hosted a small gathering at my apartment to celebrate my birthday. I invited a few close friends and asked everyone to bring a dish to share. Among the guests was my friend Sarah, who has a reputation for being a bit of a food snob and always critiques everyone’s cooking.

When Sarah arrived with her dish, I noticed it was a store-bought pasta salad. I had spent a lot of time preparing a homemade lasagna and side dishes, so I couldn't help but make a light-hearted comment, saying, “Wow, it must have been a real challenge to whip up that pasta salad!” Sarah responded with a scowl and said, “At least I didn’t burn anything.” 

The mood shifted a bit after that, and I felt bad for my comment, but I brushed it off. Later in the evening, while everyone was eating, Sarah kept making snide remarks about my cooking, claiming that her store-bought salad was somehow superior. I got annoyed and snapped back, telling her that if she didn’t like my food, she could just leave.

Things escalated, and we ended up in a heated argument in front of everyone. Friends tried to mediate, but it was awkward, and the fun atmosphere of the party was ruined. Ultimately, Sarah left in a huff, and I felt terrible about how the night turned out. 

I know I shouldn’t have provoked her with my earlier comment, but I also think she was too harsh on my cooking. AITA?",574,1478,0.53,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_89829,2022-01-31 00:00:00,ESH,1371,AITA

At one point, a couple of my buddies started playing a game that involved a lot of teasing and joking around. I thought it would be funny to join in and started making some light-hearted jabs at one of my friends, who is a bit more sensitive than the others.

At first, he laughed along with us, but as the game went on, I could tell he was starting to get uncomfortable. I didn’t stop, thinking he was just playing along. Eventually, he snapped and told me to knock it off, but I brushed it off as him being overly sensitive. Later, I overheard him talking to a mutual friend, and it sounded like he was really upset about what I had said.

Feeling guilty, I tried to apologize later in the night, but he just ignored me. I ended up getting frustrated and told him he was being too dramatic, which didn’t help the situation. My other friends started to pick sides, and soon, the party atmosphere became tense.

Everyone sucks here,"So, my best friend Jake and I have been inseparable since childhood. We share everything: secrets, dreams, and even the same friend group. Recently, Jake started dating a girl named Amy, and they quickly became serious. I was happy for him, but it seemed like Amy was taking more of his time and attention, which made me a bit uncomfortable.

One night, our friend group planned a big get-together, and Jake told me he couldn’t make it because he was going to dinner with Amy's parents. I was disappointed but understood. However, in the group chat, I jokingly said something along the lines of, ""Guess Jake's too busy for us now that he has a girlfriend!"" 

To my surprise, Amy replied, saying she found my comment rude and disrespectful. I thought it was a harmless joke, but I ended up feeling defensive and took it too far by saying something like, ""Well, maybe he should pick his friends over some girl he's only known for a couple of months."" 

The group chat exploded with mixed reactions. Some friends sided with Amy, saying it was a low blow, while others agreed that my joke was just friendly banter. Jake eventually jumped in, saying I shouldn't have said anything like that, and it felt like he was choosing Amy over our friendship.

Now, there’s this tension between us, and Jake is upset that I didn’t respect his new relationship. I feel like I was just being honest about my feelings, but I also regret how I handled the situation.

Everyone sucks here,"My friends and I planned a weekend camping trip in the mountains. There were four of us: me, my best friend Sarah, and another couple, Mike and Jess. We were all excited and packed our gear, ready for a fun escape from the city.

On the first night, we set up camp and started a fire. Everyone brought food to share, and we had a great time cooking and laughing. However, as the night wore on, Jess started drinking a bit too much. At first, it was all in good fun, but soon she became overly loud and started making jokes at Mike's expense, poking fun at his job and embarrassing him in front of everyone.

I tried to lighten the mood by changing the subject, but Jess wouldn't stop. Mike looked visibly upset, and I could see he was getting really uncomfortable. I told Jess to ease up and that she was crossing a line, but she brushed me off, saying I was being too serious.

At that point, I lost my patience. I told Jess that if she couldn't respect Mike, then maybe she shouldn't be drinking so much. This caused a huge argument, and Jess accused me of ruining the fun. Mike then jumped in, defending Jess and saying I was overreacting. It turned into a heated back-and-forth, and Sarah was stuck in the middle, trying to mediate.

Eventually, Jess stormed off to her tent, and Mike followed her to talk. I felt bad for escalating things, but I also felt justified for standing up for Mike. Later, when we were all sitting around the campfire again, the vibe was completely off. I apologized to Mike for my outburst but also pointed out that he should have stood up to Jess. He said I was being too harsh, and that made me frustrated all over again.

Now I feel like we all acted poorly: Jess for drinking too much and being disrespectful, me for losing my cool, and Mike for not addressing Jess's behavior sooner.

Everyone sucks here,"I live in a small town and have a close-knit group of friends. Recently, we started a weekly game night to hang out and relax. I love hosting, but I have a pretty small apartment, so I usually ask everyone to bring snacks or drinks to share. 

One of my friends, Mark, has been coming to the game nights for a while now, but he tends to bring the same thing every time: a pack of cheap chips and a soda. Honestly, it’s getting a bit old, especially since I put in a lot of effort to make sure there are different snacks and drinks every week. 

Last week, I decided to be a little more direct and told Mark, in front of everyone, that I appreciated him coming, but it would be great if he could change it up a bit and bring something different next time. I thought it was a lighthearted suggestion, but he got really defensive and accused me of being ungrateful. I ended up snapping back and said, “Well, if you’re going to keep bringing the same boring stuff, maybe you shouldn’t come at all.”

The tension was palpable after that, and a couple of other friends chimed in, saying I was being a bit harsh, while others agreed that Mark's contributions were lacking. Mark left early, clearly upset, and now our group feels strained. 

I’ve been thinking about it a lot, and I realize that while I was frustrated, I might have overstepped by calling him out publicly. But at the same time, I feel like I was justified in wanting some variety and expecting my friends to contribute more to our hangouts.

My girlfriend, however, doesn't understand the importance of this time for me and tends to get annoyed when I'm glued to my computer screen for hours. 

Last week, I was particularly excited about a new game release that we had been waiting for, and my friends had planned a big gaming session to kick it off. I told my girlfriend about it earlier in the week, and she seemed fine with it, even saying she would use that time to catch up on her own hobbies. However, when Friday night rolled around, she seemed to change her mind. 

She came into the room while I was setting everything up and said she wanted to hang out instead. I explained that I had already made plans and was really looking forward to it. She got upset and accused me of prioritizing my gaming friends over her, which made me feel really frustrated. I tried to reassure her that I still wanted to spend time with her, just not tonight. 

In the heat of the moment, I snapped and told her she was being unreasonable for trying to pull me away from something I had been looking forward to for days. That did not help the situation, and she ended up leaving the room in tears, saying I never prioritize her. I felt guilty afterwards, but I also feel like she overreacted by trying to interrupt something that I had already committed to.

She politely asked if I could move my bag from the chair next to me because she needed to clear the table for a new customer.

I reluctantly moved my bag but made a comment about how I didn’t understand why she couldn’t just wait a little longer since there were other open tables.

After she cleaned that table, she came back and asked if she could refill the sugar and napkin holder on my table. Annoyed, I snapped, “Can’t you just do that later?” I immediately felt bad for being rude, but I was stressed and just wanted to focus on my studying. 

She looked taken aback, and I could sense the tension. I went back to my studying, but I felt guilty for how I treated her. When I finished my drink, instead of cleaning up after myself like I normally would, I just left my cup and napkin on the table.

I’m a 24-year-old working professional, and my younger brother, who’s 21, has been struggling to find a job after graduating. He’s been living with our parents, and I’ve noticed that he’s become increasingly frustrated and withdrawn. Our parents have been putting a lot of pressure on him to find a job quickly, which I know isn’t helping his mental state. 

Last week, I invited him out for dinner to catch up. During our conversation, I tried to encourage him and suggested he consider internships or volunteer work to gain some experience. Instead of being receptive, he snapped at me and said, “You don’t know what it’s like; you got a job handed to you.” I was taken aback and, feeling defensive, I replied, “Well, maybe if you actually tried harder instead of moping around, you’d find something.” 

This led to an argument where we both said some hurtful things. He accused me of being condescending and unsupportive, while I told him he was acting like a child for not taking charge of his life. Our parents heard us arguing and got involved, scolding us both for not supporting each other and creating unnecessary drama.

Everyone sucks here,"I (28F) have a close friend (30F) who has been going through a tough time after a recent breakup. I’ve been trying to support her as much as I can, taking her out for meals, listening to her vent about her ex, and even inviting her to my house for movie nights. 

Last week, I invited her over for dinner and planned a nice meal, something special I thought she would enjoy. I even made dessert! However, when she arrived, she seemed really distracted and started scrolling through her phone the entire time we were eating. I tried to engage her in conversation, but she was barely responding, and it felt like I was having dinner with myself. 

Feeling frustrated, I finally asked if everything was okay and if she wanted to talk about anything. She looked up and snapped that she was fine, but she was just messaging a guy she was interested in and didn’t want to miss his replies. I couldn't help but feel hurt and a bit disrespected. I told her that if she was more interested in texting than spending time with me, maybe she should have just stayed home. 

She got defensive, saying that I should be more understanding given her situation, and that I was being selfish for wanting her full attention. I ended up raising my voice and told her she was being inconsiderate. We ended the evening on a sour note, and she hasn’t reached out since.

Looking back, I feel like I overreacted, but I also think she was being rude. So, Reddit, AITA for getting upset and calling her out? Or is she in the wrong for prioritizing her phone over our time together?",925,2639,0.98,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_98099,2018-09-16 00:00:00,ESH,1555,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"This is a bit of a complicated situation. So, here’s the backstory:

A few weeks ago, my friend Sam threw a party to celebrate his promotion at work. Sam is a pretty laid-back guy and always throws great gatherings, so it was nice to have something to look forward to. I was excited to see our mutual friends and enjoy the night.

The party was going well, with music, food, and everyone in a good mood. As the night went on, I noticed that one of our friends, Alex, had had a little too much to drink. He was being loud and kind of out of control, but we all know Alex can get like that sometimes, so I just kept an eye on him.

At one point, Alex decided to try and show off by doing a dance move on the table. We all laughed it off at first, but then he slipped and fell, knocking over drinks and bumping into Sam’s new TV stand, which caused some serious damage. Everyone went quiet, and the atmosphere shifted. 

Sam, understandably upset, yelled at Alex to get out. Alex, feeling embarrassed and defensive, started shouting back, saying it was just an accident, and that everyone else had been encouraging him to dance on the table. It escalated into a heated argument, and I found myself stuck in the middle. 

Instead of diffusing the situation, I made a joke about how maybe Alex should stick to dancing in the living room instead of on tables. It was meant to lighten the mood, but it just made things worse. Alex shot back at me, saying that I was just as much of a jerk for not having his back. To be honest, I didn't think he was handling the situation well either, but I wish I had just kept my mouth shut.

After Alex stormed out, Sam and I ended up in a heated conversation about the whole thing. He admitted that he was upset about the TV stand but also about how Alex had acted. I told Sam that Alex needed to take responsibility for his actions, but I also realized that I didn't help the situation by making that joke.

In the end, I feel bad for how everything unfolded. I think we could have all handled it better. So, am I the asshole for not supporting my friend when he needed it and for making a joke at the wrong time?",48,1283,0.81,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_36643,2019-07-03 00:00:00,ESH,2145,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My best friend, Jenna, and I have been inseparable since high school. We used to share everything, including our dreams and plans for the future. However, over the past few months, things have taken a turn. Jenna has gotten really into this new relationship with a guy named Lucas, and it's like she has forgotten about everyone else.

I’m happy for her, but she’s become a bit obsessed. All she talks about is Lucas—his hobbies, his likes, how great he is in bed—it’s exhausting. I tried to be supportive at first, but after weeks of non-stop updates, I snapped one night at dinner. I told her that while I’m glad she’s happy, I miss my friend and that Lucas isn’t the only thing in her life. I said she sounded like a “walking advertisement” for their relationship.

She got really upset and accused me of being jealous and not wanting her to be happy. I said that wasn’t true and that I just wanted her to find balance in her life. We ended up arguing, and I may have taken things too far by saying that if she kept pushing me away, she might end up alone when this relationship falls apart.

In the heat of the moment, I also mentioned a few of her flaws that I’d always kept to myself, like how she can be really self-centered and dismissive of other people’s feelings when she’s wrapped up in her own world. It wasn’t kind, and I could see how hurt she was.

Afterwards, I felt terrible for bringing up her flaws and for my harsh words. I reached out to apologize, but she hasn’t responded. Now, I’m left wondering if I was right to express my feelings or if I overstepped by being rude and pointing out her weaknesses.

My girlfriend (28f) and I (30m) have been together for about three years, and we both have demanding jobs. I work in tech, and she’s in healthcare, which often means late hours and stress. We both enjoy our careers and try to make time for each other, but it can be tough.

Recently, my girlfriend got a promotion, and I’m incredibly proud of her. She’s been working really hard, and I wanted to celebrate this milestone. I thought it would be great to plan a surprise dinner with our closest friends and family to make her feel special.

I spent a couple of weeks organizing everything, coordinating with our friends, and booking a nice restaurant for the celebration. I wanted it to be a surprise, so I didn’t tell her about it until the day of, thinking it would make it even more exciting.

However, when I finally revealed the surprise, she didn’t react the way I expected. She seemed overwhelmed and upset, saying she had a lot of work to catch up on and didn’t feel like celebrating. It turns out she had a stressful week and just wanted to relax at home. 

I was disappointed and felt a bit hurt that she wasn’t excited about something I put so much effort into. I tried to convince her to join us, saying it would be good for her to unwind and that all of our friends were looking forward to it. Ultimately, she decided to stay home, and I went to the dinner without her.

At the dinner, I ended up feeling guilty because I noticed that everyone was having a good time, but I felt like I was celebrating without her. I shared my feelings with my friends, and some of them agreed that I should have checked in with her beforehand. Others felt that I was just trying to do something nice for her.

Now I’m left feeling confused. I thought I was being supportive by celebrating her achievement, but I also recognize that I might have overstepped by not considering her feelings first.

Everyone sucks here,"A few weeks ago, my girlfriend and I were invited to a weekend getaway with a group of her friends at a cabin in the mountains. I was initially excited about it, but I learned that we would be sharing the space with a couple of her friends who I have always found a bit difficult to deal with. They have a tendency to be dismissive and often make snide remarks, especially about things like music and movies, and I knew that being in close quarters could be tough.

The day before we left, I jokingly mentioned to my girlfriend that I might not be able to handle being around them for an entire weekend. She laughed it off and assured me that it would be fun, but I was still anxious about it. On the drive there, I made a few comments about how I hoped they wouldn't be as annoying as usual, and I think my girlfriend started to feel a bit embarrassed.

Once we arrived, everything started off fine, but later that evening, the group decided to play some music. I didn't particularly like the playlist they put together, which was filled with songs I consider cringey. I made a few sarcastic comments about the music, which led to some eye-rolling among the group. I didn’t mean to offend anyone; I was just trying to lighten the mood with humor, but it backfired.

At one point, one of her friends snapped at me, saying I could just keep my opinions to myself if I didn’t like it. I reacted poorly and told her that if she had better taste in music, maybe I wouldn’t have to comment. My girlfriend looked mortified, and the rest of the group went quiet. I could tell I had crossed a line, but I felt backed into a corner and defensive.

The vibe in the cabin shifted, and I could see my girlfriend was upset with me. I tried to apologize later that night, but she said I needed to learn how to control my comments and be more respectful, especially since I was a guest. I felt frustrated because I thought my comments were light-hearted, and I didn’t think anyone would take them seriously.

The next day, things were still tense, and I ended up feeling isolated. I decided to leave early, which made my girlfriend even more upset. She said it was immature to bail out because I couldn’t handle a little discomfort. But I felt that I was being unfairly criticized for my opinions.

Now, she’s not speaking to me much, and her friends are also giving me the cold shoulder. I’ve apologized but still feel that their reaction was over the top. I think we all contributed to the awkwardness of the situation, but I’m not sure if I’m the only one at fault.

So, I work at a call center and usually, I'm pretty good at handling customer complaints. However, last week was one of those days where everything seemed to go wrong. I was on a call with a very frustrated customer who had been transferred to me after two other representatives couldn’t help her. She was really upset about an issue with her bill, and honestly, I could understand her frustration.

But here’s the thing: my supervisor had just pulled me aside for a quick chat before that call. She told me we were going to have a staff meeting soon, and I needed to prepare some notes for it. I was trying to juggle that while also managing the angry customer on the line. As a result, I started to feel overwhelmed. 

At one point, the customer was getting increasingly agitated, and I could feel my patience wearing thin. I ended up snapping at her, saying something like, ""I can't help if your bill doesn't make sense!"" I immediately regretted it, but she hung up on me. 

Later, my supervisor overheard the call and pulled me into her office. She was clearly disappointed and said that I need to maintain professionalism, no matter the circumstances. I apologized and explained how stressed I was, but she said that’s no excuse for being rude to customers. 

I felt bad about how I handled the situation, but I also think the pressure of trying to prepare for the meeting while dealing with a difficult call was a lot to manage at once. A few days later, I overheard another coworker, who had also been stressed, venting about a similar situation and she mentioned that she had handled it better than I did. I couldn't help but feel defensive and I told her that we all have our breaking points.

Now, I'm wondering if I was in the wrong for snapping at the customer or if my supervisor was too harsh on me given the circumstances. And maybe I shouldn't have vented to my coworker like that.

I had a particularly long week at work and was exhausted by Friday. I mentioned to my partner that I needed help with the cleaning this weekend, especially since we had friends coming over for a get-together on Saturday night. They promised they would help but didn’t seem to take it seriously. 

Saturday morning, I woke up and started cleaning, expecting them to join me. By noon, they were still on the couch watching a show. I asked them again to help out, and they just said they’d get to it later. After a few hours of cleaning on my own, I started feeling really frustrated. I snapped and said something like, “It’s not fair that I’m doing all the work while you sit around.” 

They got defensive and started listing all the times they helped out in the past, claiming I was overreacting.

The deadline for the event was approaching, and I was getting anxious because I hadn’t heard from her in weeks.

One evening, I messaged her to ask if she could drop it off soon. She replied that she was busy and would do it when she could. I got frustrated because she tends to prioritize her social life over family obligations. I know she has the time; she just chooses to spend it differently. Instead of letting it go, I snapped and sent her a long message about how inconsiderate she was being and how I felt like I was always the one putting in effort to keep our family connected.

She responded defensively, saying I was being dramatic and that I should be more understanding. This only fueled my anger. I ended up calling her, and we both yelled at each other for a while.

Last week, I was serving when a friend of mine, Jake, who is a decent singer, was set to perform. I was excited to see him play, but I also had a lot on my plate at work that night. I was juggling multiple tables, and the café was packed. During one of his sets, I took a moment to listen, and I really enjoyed it, but I couldn’t stay and watch for too long since I had to attend to customers.

While I was running around, I overheard some of the audience whispering about how I hadn’t been paying attention to Jake. One of them even said, “Wow, his friend really doesn’t care about him.” I felt uncomfortable but didn’t let it get to me too much.

Later that night, I noticed some of the customers were a bit too loud and rowdy, almost drowning out the performances. I decided to politely ask them to tone it down since it was disrespectful to the performers. They didn’t take it well and started shouting back, saying they paid to be there and they would do what they wanted.

I thought I was being funny, but Jenna took it seriously and said she would be disappointed if people didn’t put in effort. I brushed it off, thinking it was just a light-hearted comment.

Fast forward to our meeting day, and I showed up in my costume, which was indeed fabulous if I do say so myself. I put a lot of effort into it, but I wanted to keep it fun rather than overly serious.

Everyone sucks here,"Last summer, my best friend and I decided to start a small side business selling handmade crafts online. We pooled our savings and set up a modest website, and things started off pretty well. We were both excited and eager to make this work.

About a month in, I noticed that my friend was often distracted and not pulling their weight. I was doing most of the marketing and customer service while they would sometimes just disappear for days. When I brought it up, they confessed that they were going through some personal issues, including family problems and anxiety. I understood and tried to be supportive, but I also felt frustrated because I was doing all the work.

As the summer went on, my friend's situation didn't improve, and I ended up covering more and more of our costs, from materials to website fees. I started feeling resentful, and during a conversation where we discussed profits, I blurted out that I was tired of doing everything while they sat back and did nothing. My friend got defensive and accused me of being unsupportive during their tough time.

Things got heated, and we ended up arguing. I said some hurtful things about their lack of commitment and how I was essentially running the business on my own. They retaliated by saying I was being selfish and only thinking about profits rather than our friendship.

After that fight, we both cooled off, but the dynamic of our friendship changed. We’re both upset and feel like we crossed a line. Neither of us has reached out to make amends because we're both waiting for the other to take the first step. I wonder now if I went too far in expressing my frustration or if they needed to step up more.

I felt a bit offended, as it's not just a preference for me but an actual health issue. I explained that it's not just about being picky; it's about avoiding serious health consequences. The conversation escalated, and I ended up suggesting that if he really cared about his friends, he would be more understanding and not dismissive of my dietary needs.

Everyone sucks here,"I'm feeling really conflicted about a situation that happened at work, and I could use some perspective on whether I'm in the wrong.

I work in a busy call center, and last week we were experiencing an unusually high volume of calls due to a promotion we were running. My team was already understaffed, and the pressure was mounting. I was trying my best to keep up, but I could feel the stress building.

During one particularly hectic shift, a coworker, Sarah, who tends to be a bit of a procrastinator, was obviously overwhelmed. I overheard her on the phone with a customer, and it sounded like she was struggling to answer their questions. I was just about to take a call when I heard Sarah say something that wasn't entirely accurate. Instead of letting her handle it, I jumped in and started correcting her in front of the customer. I thought I was helping, but in hindsight, I might have embarrassed her.

Sarah got flustered and ended the call rather abruptly, and I could see she was upset. Afterward, she confronted me, saying I shouldn't have interrupted her like that and that it made her look unprofessional. I thought I was just trying to assist her, but I realized that my approach might have come off as condescending.

Later, during our break, I vented to another coworker about how Sarah always seems to struggle and how it makes our job harder. I didn't realize she was nearby and overheard me. She then confronted me again, saying I should be more supportive instead of tearing her down behind her back. 

Now, I'm feeling guilty because I didn’t mean to undermine her, but I also think that I was trying to keep the customer happy. My manager also caught wind of the situation and pulled me aside, mentioning that I need to be more of a team player.

Everyone sucks here,"I need some perspective on a situation that has gotten out of hand between my sister and me, and I can’t help but feel that we both share some responsibility for the mess.

So, here’s the context: my sister and I have always been pretty close, but we have very different lifestyles. I’m more of a free spirit, while she’s always been the responsible one, focusing on her career and family. She’s married with two kids, and I’m single, working a job I love that allows me to travel a lot. 

A few months ago, I made plans to take a trip to a music festival. I was really excited and even invited my sister and her husband to join. They both declined, saying they had family commitments, which I understood. However, I was shocked when I saw them posting about a weekend getaway to a cabin with their friends on social media, right around the same time as the festival. 

I felt hurt and betrayed that they chose to spend time with friends rather than support my plans. In a moment of frustration, I commented on one of their posts saying something like, ""Must be nice to have time for friends while I’m out here going alone to a festival. Thanks for the support, sis."" It was a petty thing to say, and I immediately regretted it, but I was really feeling the sting of rejection.

My sister responded with a long message, expressing how disappointed she was in me for “throwing shade” and how she thought I’d be more understanding of their family commitments. She also said that I was being selfish for expecting them to drop everything for my plans. I felt defensive and fired back, saying that she has no idea what it feels like to be alone and that her priorities were skewed.

After that, we didn’t speak for a few weeks. I tried to reach out to apologize, but she wasn’t receptive. Eventually, I ended up sending her a text saying that I was sorry for my comment but that I felt like she didn’t take my feelings into account either. That just escalated things further.

Now, our family is caught in the middle, and I can’t help but feel that we both acted poorly.

A few months ago, I (28F) got into a pretty intense friendship with a guy I’ll call Jake (30M). We hit it off immediately and started hanging out a lot. We even had some flirty moments, but nothing serious happened since we both said we weren't looking for relationships at the moment. 

About a month into our friendship, I started feeling a bit off; I had some symptoms that concerned me, so I went to get tested for STIs. To my shock, I tested positive for gonorrhea. I hadn't been with anyone else for over a year prior to Jake, so I was pretty certain I had contracted it from him.

I decided to confront him about it. I sent him a message stating that I needed to talk and told him that I had tested positive and that he should get tested as well. Instead of being concerned, he got defensive and accused me of trying to blame him for something I could have gotten elsewhere. This really hurt me since I had been open and honest with him from the start.

After that, we had a heated argument. I called him irresponsible and he fired back, saying I was just as careless for not pushing for us to get tested together before our flirty moments. We ended up cutting ties completely, but I still felt frustrated that he wouldn’t take any responsibility.

A week later, I decided to message him again through a different platform, wanting to give him a heads up about his potential risk of spreading it to others. To my surprise, he had blocked me. I felt angry and helpless, so in a moment of frustration, I went on social media and made a post about my experience, indirectly calling him out without mentioning his name. I thought it might raise awareness.

A few mutual friends saw it and got upset, saying I was being petty and that I should have just moved on instead of airing my grievances publicly. I felt justified in wanting to warn others, but I realized that maybe I had crossed a line by putting something so personal out there.

So, now I’m wondering, am I the asshole for calling him out and not just letting him be? Or is he equally at fault for his lack of responsibility and reaction to the situation?",392,1814,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_39422,2023-08-25 00:00:00,ESH,2163,AITA

They've been together for about six months, and while I don't know her well, I've noticed some red flags in their relationship. Jake has always been very caring and supportive, but lately, he seems to be distant and stressed. 

A few weeks ago, I saw a post on social media where Sarah called him ""lazy"" for not wanting to go out every weekend and spend money on entertainment. I thought that was pretty harsh, especially since Jake works long hours and needs his downtime. I felt it was my place to talk to him about it, so I brought it up when we were hanging out. I told him that I was worried about how she treats him and that he deserves someone who appreciates him. 

Jake got defensive and said that Sarah is just playful and that he really likes her. I felt bad for overstepping, but I was genuinely concerned about him. I later sent him a message apologizing for bringing it up and saying I just wanted the best for him. Instead of letting it go, he called me and said that I was being a bad friend by trying to undermine his relationship. I was taken aback, feeling like I was just being honest out of care.

In the aftermath, we haven't spoken much, and I feel guilty for trying to intervene. At the same time, I think Jake is being a bit harsh by shutting me out for expressing my concern.

As the wedding day approached, she confided in me that her parents were having a lot of trouble financially and that they were struggling to pay for the wedding. She was worried they might even have to postpone or downsize it drastically.

I wanted to help, but I also knew my friend was proud and probably wouldn’t accept direct financial help from me. So, I came up with the idea of setting up a crowdfunding campaign to help her family cover the costs. I thought, “This could be a nice surprise for her!” I quietly created the campaign, set a modest goal, and shared it with some of our mutual friends, explaining the situation without revealing too much about her family's struggles.

At first, people were really supportive, and I was feeling good about it. However, when my friend found out, she was furious. She felt that I had overstepped my bounds and betrayed her trust. She told me that she wanted to handle her family’s issues privately and that I should have talked to her first instead of going behind her back. I thought I was being a good friend by trying to help her, but it clearly upset her.

On the other hand, I do feel like I should have respected her wishes and consulted her before taking any action. I had this nagging feeling that maybe I was being a bit presumptuous and intrusive. Ultimately, we ended up having a huge fight about it, both of us saying hurtful things.

During the gathering, she brought some of her baked goods to share, and I have to admit, they were pretty good. However, I also had a few desserts that I had made and brought along. When I went to present my desserts, my sister made a comment about how I should “stick to cookies and leave the fancy stuff to her.” It was meant as a joke, but it rubbed me the wrong way.

Feeling a bit defensive, I joked back, saying, “Well, at least I don’t need to charge an arm and a leg for my cookies.” It was all in good fun, but it sparked a bit of tension in the room. My sister got visibly upset, and instead of letting it go, she started to argue that I was undermining her efforts and making her look bad in front of our family.

Things escalated, and we ended up having a shouting match right in front of everyone. Our parents eventually stepped in to defuse the situation, but it left a sour note on the gathering.

I’m pretty laid-back, but when it comes to cleanliness, I have certain standards, and my roommates don’t seem to share the same level of concern.

The main issue has been with our kitchen. I’m often the one who cooks, and I like to keep everything tidy while I do. However, my roommates tend to leave dirty dishes in the sink for days and don’t wipe down the counters after using them. At first, I tried to be understanding and just cleaned up after them without saying anything, hoping they would eventually notice and change their habits. 

After a few weeks of this, I snapped. I sent a group message saying I couldn't keep cleaning up after everyone and requested that we all try to be more considerate. I thought it was a reasonable request, but my roommates brushed it off and continued their habits. 

Frustrated, I decided to take a more assertive approach and began leaving passive-aggressive notes on the fridge, like “Please wash your dishes! Thanks!” and “Let’s keep the kitchen tidy!” I thought this would motivate them to change, but instead, it caused tension. They started responding with their own notes saying things like “We’re busy too!” and “Chill out!” 

In response, I got even more fed up and began refusing to clean any common areas at all. I let the dishes pile up, and the kitchen became a mess.

Now, we’re both feeling hurt and defensive. She says I'm being inconsiderate, and I feel like she doesn’t appreciate how hard I work. We’ve both been disrespectful to each other during this argument, and neither of us has backed down.

Everyone sucks here,"It all started when my friend Sarah organized a small get-together for our friend group. We hadn’t seen each other in months, and I was genuinely excited to reconnect. However, when I arrived, I noticed that the mood was a bit off, and there were some unspoken tensions among a few of my friends.

During the night, Sarah brought up a sensitive topic—her recent breakup with Jake, who was also part of our group. I could see she was struggling, and I tried to be supportive. But then, out of nowhere, Jess, another friend, made a joke about Sarah's breakup, saying something like, “At least now you can look for someone who doesn’t ghost you!” It was meant to be light-hearted, but it clearly hit a nerve.

In a moment of frustration, I snapped back at Jess, saying, “Maybe if you weren’t so self-absorbed, you’d realize that some people don’t find humor in their pain!” The room fell silent, and I could see Jess’s face drop. It was harsh, and I immediately felt bad for saying it, but I was also angry at how insensitive Jess was being.

After that, Sarah tried to change the subject, but the damage was done. Jess shot back with, “Well, at least I’m not the one who keeps bringing up my ex’s name every five minutes!” It turned into a back-and-forth where both of us were throwing passive-aggressive comments at each other. At one point, I even said something like, “Maybe if you had any real friends, you'd know how to support one!” 

The night ended awkwardly, with everyone trying to leave as quickly as possible. I texted Sarah later to apologize for my outburst, and she told me that both Jess and I were being out of line.

So, I’m left wondering, did I go too far? I was trying to defend my friend, but I also didn’t have to stoop to that level. Am I the asshole here?",126,1757,0.84,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_52322,2023-03-10 00:00:00,ESH,1778,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I work as a teacher in a local high school, and recently, there’s been a lot of tension between me and one of my colleagues, Lisa. We both teach different subjects but share a few classes in the same grade. Lisa is relatively new to the school, having started just last year, and she’s quite passionate about her subject. However, her teaching style is very different from mine, and I often find it hard to collaborate with her.

A few weeks ago, during a group project where students had to work in pairs, I overheard Lisa telling her students that they shouldn't listen to me and that I was ""too rigid"" with my grading. This hurt, not just because it undermined my authority in front of the students but also because it felt unprofessional. Instead of confronting her directly, I decided to vent to a few of our mutual colleagues about how I felt she was disrespecting my role and how it was affecting the students.

Well, word got around, and Lisa caught wind of what I said. She confronted me during lunch, and we ended up having a heated argument. In the heat of the moment, I called her ""inexperienced"" and suggested she should take a few more years to really understand how to teach effectively. This hurt her deeply, and she ended up leaving the lunchroom in tears.

Afterwards, I felt guilty for how I handled things. However, I still believe she crossed a line by undermining me in front of the students. To make matters worse, I’ve recently discovered that she’s been talking about me to other staff members, painting me as the villain in this situation. I know I could have done a better job handling the conflict, but I also think she needs to be more mindful of how her words affect others.

Now, both of us are getting the cold shoulder from some of our colleagues, and the overall atmosphere in the staff room has become uncomfortable. I’m starting to wonder if I should have just kept my mouth shut or approached her in a more professional manner. So, AITA here, or is it just a situation where we both messed up?",822,2270,0.61,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_71451,2020-03-31 00:00:00,ESH,2030,AITA

We were told it would be a formal affair, and I was looking forward to it. My girlfriend and I have been together for a few years, and I knew how much this event meant to her.

When we received the invitation, I made it clear that I didn’t have a formal suit, but my girlfriend insisted I could just rent one. I agreed, but as the date approached, I got really busy with work and didn’t have time to go suit shopping. The night before the wedding, after working late, I was exhausted and stressed. I asked my girlfriend if I could just wear a nice button-up shirt, dress pants, and shoes instead. 

She was not happy and insisted I needed to wear a suit since it was her best friend's wedding, and she wanted to make a good impression. I pushed back, saying I didn't think it was fair to spend money on a suit that I would only wear once, especially when I could look presentable without one. We ended up arguing about it, and I felt overwhelmed.

In the end, I reluctantly agreed to rent a suit, but I was frustrated and resentful. On the day of the wedding, I showed up in the suit but felt like a fraud since I was visibly uncomfortable in it. During the reception, I made a couple of comments about how ridiculous it was to spend so much on a suit just to sit at a table. I think I might have come off as a bit rude, but I was just venting my frustration.

She wants to get married on the same day as my birthday, which is something I've never been a fan of—I've always preferred to keep my birthday separate from any big events, and I usually celebrate it with a small gathering of friends and family.

When she first mentioned the date, I voiced my concerns about sharing my birthday with her wedding. I didn't mean to come off as selfish, but I thought it was a fair point to bring up. I suggested that she consider another date, maybe even a weekend before or after. She was upset by my suggestion and accused me of being self-centered and not supportive of her big day.

After a few days of back and forth, I ended up saying that if she went through with the wedding on my birthday, I wouldn’t be able to attend because I wouldn’t want to celebrate my birthday at someone else’s wedding. This, of course, made things worse. She feels hurt that I would even think about skipping her wedding over my birthday, and I feel like she’s being inconsiderate of my feelings.

Now, our friendship is strained, and I can't help but feel that we both overreacted. I should have been more understanding, and she should have respected my wishes.

I mentioned that I'm currently in a creative field and trying to pursue my passion rather than a traditional career path. 

He kept pushing, saying things like, ""So when are you going to get a real job?"" and ""You need to think about your future."" I was getting frustrated but tried to keep my cool. Eventually, I snapped and responded, ""At least I’m not stuck in a dead-end job out of fear of not conforming to society's standards like some people.""

I thought that was great, but I also mentioned that I still wanted to go to some of the places we had planned that serve non-vegan food because I really enjoy those meals.

So, a month ago, I was at a friend’s birthday party. It was a pretty relaxed gathering, just a few close friends hanging out. During the party, one of my friends, let’s call him Mike, started talking about his recent breakup. He was clearly upset, and as he shared his feelings, we all tried to support him. It was a tough situation, and I felt bad for him.

At one point, I thought it would be a good idea to lighten the mood, so I made a joke about relationships and breakups. It was meant to be lighthearted, but it totally fell flat. Mike immediately got defensive and snapped at me, saying I didn’t understand what he was going through. I felt embarrassed but brushed it off, thinking he was just upset.

After that, I tried to change the subject, but he kept bringing up his ex and how heartbroken he was. I made another attempt at humor, trying to relate it to a funny story from my own past breakups, but Mike just got angrier. He accused me of being insensitive and not respecting his feelings.

In the heat of the moment, I shot back that he needed to toughen up and that life goes on. At that point, the atmosphere got really tense, and others in the group started telling both of us to calm down. I ended up feeling like I was being ganged up on, which made me double down. I said that maybe if he spent less time moping and more time laughing, he’d feel better.

Afterward, the party kind of fizzled out, and I felt awful. I reached out to Mike a couple of days later to apologize for joking at his expense, but he was still upset and said I was a bad friend for not supporting him when he needed it.

I’ve been wrestling with this situation for a while now and would appreciate some outside opinions. This happened a few months ago when I was attending a small family reunion. My cousin, who I’ve always had a bit of a rivalry with, decided to show off his new car. He’s always been the kind of guy who needs to be the center of attention, and while I was proud of him, it got a little annoying.

During the reunion, he started bragging about how much his car cost and how it was a “real investment.” I jokingly chimed in, saying something like, “Yeah, well, my car is just fine, but at least I’m not paying monthly for a status symbol.” I thought it was all in good fun, but he took it seriously and got visibly upset. 

In my defense, I’d had a rough week, and maybe I was a bit too sarcastic. To make matters worse, I decided to escalate things by bringing up some of his past failures—like when he dropped out of college and how he still lives with his parents. It was petty, and I know I shouldn’t have gone there, but I felt cornered and wanted to hold my ground.

Well, the family ended up getting involved, and it turned into a huge argument where everyone started airing grievances. My cousin’s parents were upset with me, and my parents were trying to calm everyone down but ended up arguing too. By the end of the night, we all walked away feeling pretty sour about each other.

I brought this up to my friend a week before the trip, suggesting that I could cover the accommodation costs instead since I had already booked a cheap motel for the nights we would be staying. I thought this was a fair compromise since I would still be contributing, just in a different way.

My friend was not happy with this at all. He said it was unfair for me to change the agreement last minute and that we had both agreed to split everything down the middle. He insisted that if I couldn't afford to pay half for everything, then maybe I shouldn't go.

I felt really hurt by his reaction because I wasn't trying to back out of the trip; I just wanted to make it work given my situation. On the other hand, I could see how he felt like I was changing the rules last minute. We ended up arguing, and things got pretty tense between us.

Now, I'm wondering if I was wrong for suggesting to change how we split the costs. AITA for trying to find a different way to make things work?",303,1051,0.59,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_81836,2020-01-23 00:00:00,ESH,1308,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I’m a 28-year-old guy, and my best friend, Jake, is 27. We’ve known each other since high school and have been through a lot together. Recently, Jake started dating a girl named Sarah, who seems nice enough, but I don’t feel like she’s right for him. She can be very self-centered and often interrupts him when he talks, which I find frustrating. 

A few weeks ago, we all went out for dinner, and during the meal, Sarah dominated the conversation, barely letting Jake say a word. I tried to engage him in other topics, but she would just jump in and steer it back to herself. At one point, I jokingly said, “Wow, Sarah, do you have anything to ask Jake? He hasn’t said much this whole dinner.” I thought it would lighten the mood, but she got upset and said I was being rude for undermining her.

After dinner, Jake pulled me aside and said I should apologize to Sarah because she was really hurt. I told him I didn’t think I did anything wrong, and besides, he should stand up for himself more. He got defensive and said I was being a bad friend for not supporting him and his relationship. I felt frustrated because I was just trying to help him, but I agreed to apologize to her anyway.

When I told Sarah I was sorry for what I said, she brushed it off and said I should just be more supportive of their relationship. I ended up feeling annoyed that I had to apologize when I thought I was right.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I have a friend, let’s call him Jake, who’s always been a bit of a know-it-all. He constantly tries to one-up everyone in conversations, especially when it comes to movies and music. He prides himself on having impeccable taste and often looks down on others' preferences. 

Recently, a group of us decided to have a movie night. We all agreed to bring our favorite films, and I suggested a classic that I thought everyone would enjoy. Jake immediately shot it down, saying it was too ""mainstream"" and that we should watch something ""more sophisticated"" instead. 

I got annoyed because I really wanted to share this movie that I loved. So, I snapped back at him, telling him that not everyone has to have his snobby taste and that sometimes it’s okay to enjoy popular stuff. I then insisted on watching my choice anyway, which led to a bit of a standoff in the group. 

In the end, we compromised and watched a mix of movies, but the atmosphere was tense. Jake was sulky the whole night, and I felt bad for snapping at him, even though I stand by what I said.

Everyone sucks here,"I recently attended a family gathering where my cousin was hosting a barbecue. It was a pretty relaxed atmosphere, and I was excited to see everyone. My cousin has a dog that he often lets roam freely in the backyard, and while I love animals, I know that some people, including my younger sister, are quite afraid of dogs.

As the day went on, I noticed that my cousin's dog was jumping around and getting too close to my sister, who was clearly uncomfortable and trying to avoid the dog. I brought it up to my cousin and asked if he could keep the dog on a leash or at least away from her. He laughed it off and said his dog was friendly, so there was nothing to worry about. I felt frustrated but didn’t want to escalate things, so I just kept an eye on my sister.

Later in the day, I decided to take matters into my own hands. When my cousin was distracted, I picked up the dog and put it in his car, thinking it would keep everyone more comfortable. I figured it was a harmless action that would solve the issue. 

When my cousin found out, he was furious. He felt I overstepped my boundaries and disrespected his pet. I tried to explain my reasoning, but he wouldn’t hear it. I ended up feeling guilty for causing a scene.

In the heat of the moment, I also snapped at him, saying he should have been more responsible as a pet owner. That definitely didn’t help things. Now our family is divided; some think I was right to protect my sister, while others side with my cousin.

The atmosphere was pretty chill, with snacks and music playing in the background. Everything was going well until my friend Sarah, who has a bit of a reputation for being overly critical, started making comments about the way I decorated my place. 

At first, it was harmless teasing, but as the night went on, she became more and more obnoxious. She called my decorations ""tacky"" and said my taste in music was ""terrible.""

Eventually, Sarah left the party early, clearly upset, and I felt bad about how it all unfolded. I tried to reach out the next day to apologize, but she hasn't responded.

I was happy for her, but I noticed that she changed a lot. She started canceling plans with me to spend more time with him, and it felt like our friendship was taking a backseat.

A couple of weeks ago, I invited her to a concert that we had been looking forward to for months. The day before the concert, she texted me saying that Mark had bought tickets for a different show that night and she couldn't come. I was really disappointed and felt like she was prioritizing him over our friendship.

In a moment of frustration, I replied with a snarky message saying, ""Guess I’ll just have to find a new best friend who actually wants to hang out."" It was rude, and I shouldn't have said that.

The next day at the concert, I was there with another friend, and I saw Sarah and Mark together in the crowd. I got really upset and went up to them. I confronted Sarah in front of Mark, saying she was abandoning our friendship for a guy she barely knew. She got defensive and told me I was acting ridiculous and that she was happy with Mark. It ended in a huge argument, and I stormed off.

After that, Sarah didn’t talk to me for about a week. I felt guilty for how I treated her, but I also felt like she was neglecting our friendship. Eventually, I reached out to her, and we agreed to meet up and talk things over. When we did, we both admitted that we had acted poorly, and we ended up arguing again about the situation.

Everyone sucks here,"A few months ago, my younger sister got engaged to her long-term boyfriend, and the whole family was excited about the upcoming wedding. However, things took a turn when my brother, who has been struggling with substance abuse for a while, showed up to the engagement party under the influence. He was loud, disruptive, and made a scene, embarrassing my sister in front of her friends and future in-laws.

After the party, my sister was understandably upset and expressed her frustration about my brother’s behavior. I tried to support her and suggest that we have a conversation with him about it. But I knew my brother would be defensive, and I felt nervous about how he would react. So, I suggested we just avoid the topic for now, hoping that he would clean up his act before the wedding.

A few weeks later, my sister called a family meeting to discuss the wedding plans, and she brought up my brother's behavior again. I could see that she was hurt and anxious about whether he would show up to the wedding in a similar state. I love my brother, but I also knew he was in denial about how serious his issues were, and I felt stuck between supporting him and protecting my sister.

In the heat of the moment, I said something that I regretted. I told my sister that if she wanted to avoid any drama at her wedding, she should just uninvite him. I was frustrated and scared about what might happen, but it was an unfair thing to say, especially considering my sister had always been supportive of my brother despite his struggles.

That led to a huge argument between us. My sister accused me of abandoning our brother when he needed us most, and I snapped back, saying that sometimes tough love was necessary. It escalated, and we both said hurtful things, which left our relationship strained. 

In the end, we managed to patch things up a bit, but the issue still lingers. My brother doesn’t know about the conversation and still thinks everything is fine. I feel guilty for suggesting he be uninvited and for how I reacted during our argument. My sister feels let down by both of us, and I fear I might have made things worse for everyone involved.

I’m the kind of person who likes everything to be neat and tidy, while my partner is more laid-back and doesn’t mind a bit of clutter. We had a big discussion about how we would handle the cleaning responsibilities once we moved in, and I thought we reached an understanding. I would take care of the kitchen and bathrooms, while my partner would handle the living room and bedroom.

However, after a few weeks, I noticed that my partner wasn’t keeping up with their part of the deal. The living room was often messy, and I found myself cleaning up after them, which started to frustrate me. I tried talking to them about it, but my partner got defensive and said that I was being controlling and nitpicky. They insisted that I should relax and not worry so much about the mess.

Feeling overwhelmed, I started leaving little passive-aggressive notes around the house, like “Please remember to clean up after yourself!” or “The living room isn’t a trash can!” My partner eventually confronted me about the notes and said I was being childish instead of addressing things directly.

At that point, I felt hurt and dismissed, so I raised my voice during the conversation, which escalated into a full argument. We both ended up saying things we didn’t mean, and it left a nasty atmosphere in our home.

I’m all for people enjoying themselves, but Sarah’s parties tend to go on until the early hours of the morning, and it really disrupts my sleep schedule. I work a demanding job that requires early mornings, and I’ve started feeling exhausted because of these late-night gatherings.

Last weekend, Sarah threw another one of her parties, and it was particularly loud, with music blasting and people laughing and shouting. I tried to handle it calmly at first—putting on my noise-canceling headphones and blasting my own music to drown it out. By 2 AM, I’d had enough. I decided to go out onto my balcony, which is right next to her window, and I started playing some really loud heavy metal music from my phone. I figured if she could have her fun, so could I.

Of course, this resulted in an immediate confrontation. Sarah came out and started yelling at me to stop being a jerk and ruining her party. I told her that if she could keep her music down, I wouldn’t have to resort to this. We ended up in a bit of a shouting match, and it woke up some of the other neighbors who came out to see what was going on. 

In the heat of the moment, I might have called her inconsiderate and mentioned that she should be more respectful of her neighbors. To be honest, I felt pretty justified at the time, but looking back, I know I could have handled it better, and I probably crossed a line with my reaction.

My neighbor, who I know has a tendency to be overly dramatic about parking issues, confronted me about it while I was still outside. He started yelling, claiming that I was being inconsiderate and that I had parked there without thinking about the other residents.

We all agreed, but when the time came to go shopping for supplies, my sister insisted on taking the lead and chose most of the items herself.

As I settled in, I noticed a group of kids nearby playing soccer. They were having a great time, but as the game got more intense, one of the kids accidentally kicked the ball right into my direction, and it hit my backpack.

I was a bit annoyed, but I figured it was just a game and they didn’t mean any harm. I picked up the ball and tossed it back to them, but instead of just letting it go, I yelled, “Hey, maybe try to keep it in your own area, yeah?” It felt justified at the moment since it interrupted my peaceful reading session.

A couple of the kids looked at me, surprised, but continued playing. After a few more minutes, the ball came flying my way again, and this time I caught it and decided to hold onto it for a moment, thinking I might teach them a little lesson about being more careful. 

One of the kids, about 12 years old, came over and asked for the ball back. I jokingly said, “Only if you promise to keep it away from my stuff.” He rolled his eyes and said, “Whatever,” before running back to his friends. 

Then, a woman who I assumed was their mother approached me, looking pretty upset. She said, “Can you please give the ball back? They’re just kids trying to have fun.” I could feel myself getting defensive and replied, “They need to learn to be more respectful of other people's space, you know?”

We ended up having a back-and-forth where I felt like I was standing my ground, but also realized maybe I was being a bit too harsh on the kids. She ended up taking the ball from me and telling me that I was being unreasonable.

Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I have been together for over two years, and we recently moved in together. We have a pretty solid relationship, but we do have our disagreements from time to time. One ongoing issue is about how we manage our finances. 

My partner is very frugal, almost to the point of being miserly, while I believe in enjoying life a little more, especially when it comes to experiences. We’ve had several arguments over this, but I try to respect their viewpoint, even if I don’t always agree.

Last week, we were invited to a friend's wedding that I was really excited about. I wanted to buy a nice outfit to wear, something I could feel good in for the special occasion. When I mentioned the price of the outfit I had my eye on, my partner immediately shot it down, insisting it was too expensive and that I should just wear something I already own.

I felt really frustrated because I wanted to look my best for this event, and I thought my partner was being overly critical about something that brings me joy. I ended up buying the outfit anyway, thinking it was a special occasion and worth the splurge.

When I told my partner, they were furious. They accused me of being irresponsible and not valuing our financial goals. Instead of backing down, I argued that I deserved to treat myself occasionally, especially for a significant event like a wedding. 

In the heat of the moment, we both said some hurtful things. I called them cheap and told them they needed to lighten up, while they labeled me selfish and reckless. Now, we're both feeling guilty and upset, and I don’t know how to resolve this. 

So, AITA for buying the outfit despite my partner’s objections, or are we both just at fault for how we handled the disagreement?",396,1700,0.86,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_41589,2024-01-17 00:00:00,ESH,1743,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So here’s the situation. I’m 26 and recently moved in with my older sister, who’s 31 and has a toddler. I don’t have a job yet since I just graduated and I'm trying to figure out my next steps. My sister is super busy with her kid and her job, and I really appreciate her letting me stay with her. 

Lately, though, I’ve noticed that every time she has a problem, she always turns to me for help, even when it’s unreasonable. For example, the other day, she had a meltdown because the baby wouldn’t stop crying. Instead of just taking a moment to calm down, she handed me the baby and told me to figure it out while she took a break. I tried to be supportive, but I’m not a parent, and I felt completely overwhelmed.

Fast forward a few days, and I was having a rough day. I was feeling really down about job hunting and just wanted to relax for a bit. My sister came home from work and asked if I could watch her kid while she cooked dinner. I said no, explaining that I really needed some time to recharge. She got really upset and told me that if I wanted to live with her, I needed to contribute more. I felt bad, but I also felt like I had just as much on my plate as she did.

Then, to make things worse, I found out that she told our parents that I’m being lazy and not helping her out at all. I felt blindsided because I thought our relationship was built on honesty, and instead, she was portraying me as the villain. I confronted her about it, and it turned into a huge argument where we both said hurtful things.

In retrospect, I realize that I could have handled my response better and maybe should have agreed to help her out, especially since she’s doing a lot for me. But at the same time, I feel like she’s taking my willingness to help for granted and not considering my feelings. I’m still trying to figure things out, and I think we both have some growing to do. If I’m the asshole here, then I guess I’ll own it. It just feels frustrating that we’re both kind of stuck in this cycle.",933,1485,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_73611,2023-04-24 00:00:00,ESH,2004,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I (28F) have been living with my roommate (30M) for over a year now. We both split the rent and bills evenly, which has been working out well for us. However, there’s been some tension lately that I’m not sure how to handle.

My roommate is a big fan of cooking, while I prefer to keep things simple and often eat pre-packaged meals. He loves to make elaborate dinners a few times a week, and while I appreciate his cooking, it can be frustrating because he often leaves a huge mess in the kitchen. I’ve asked him to clean up after himself a couple of times, but he brushes it off, saying he’ll do it later. I usually end up cleaning it up myself because I can’t stand the mess.

Recently, he made a big batch of his famous lasagna and told me to help myself. I was excited and planned to have some for dinner. However, when I came home from work, I found that he had eaten nearly the entire thing without asking if I wanted any. I felt a bit hurt, as he often takes the bulk of the food he cooks without checking in with me.

In the heat of the moment, I confronted him about eating my share without asking, and we ended up having a pretty heated argument where I accused him of being inconsiderate. He fired back, saying that he cooks for both of us and that I should be more grateful instead of complaining about a little mess. 

Now I feel bad for how I reacted, and I think we both crossed some lines in the argument. I don’t want to hold onto resentment, but I also don’t want to feel like my space or food is being disrespected. So, am I the asshole for confronting him over the lasagna and the mess?

Everyone sucks here,"I'm part of a local gardening club that meets weekly to maintain a community garden in a public park. We've been using this space for years, and it's a project that many of us are passionate about. Recently, a new group started using a nearby area for yoga classes every Saturday morning.

The yoga group sets up right next to our garden, and their instructor tends to play loud music during sessions. This not only disrupts our work but also scares away the birds and butterflies we try to attract to our garden. We tried to talk to them politely about lowering the volume, but the instructor brushed us off and said it was just ""part of the vibe.""

Last week, we decided to start our gardening session earlier in the day to try and avoid the yoga class. When we arrived, we noticed that they were setting up their mats and music equipment right next to our plot again. I approached their instructor and asked if they could move their setup a little further away from our garden since the noise was making it difficult for us to focus.

She got defensive and said that they had a right to be there just as much as we did, and that we should have planned our time better. To be fair, I was frustrated and snapped back, saying that they were ruining our peaceful space and that we had been there first. The argument escalated, with members from both groups exchanging heated words.

Eventually, we both agreed to just ignore each other for the day and continued with our activities, but the tension lingered. Afterward, I felt guilty about how things had escalated, especially since we had all come to the park to enjoy the space.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I have a bit of a situation that happened at my friend’s birthday party last weekend, and I can't shake the feeling that maybe I’ve been a jerk. 

To give some context, I’ve been friends with Sarah for a few years, and she’s always been the type to throw big parties. This year, she rented out a local venue and invited a ton of people. I got there a bit late, and when I walked in, everyone was already drinking and having fun. 

As I made my way around, I found a group of friends gathered around the birthday cake. Sarah was about to blow out the candles, and everyone was singing. As I joined in, someone bumped into me, and my drink spilled all over my shirt. I was annoyed, but I tried to brush it off. 

After Sarah blew out the candles, she started to cut the cake. I was just about to grab a slice when I overheard a couple of friends making jokes about how Sarah had put on some weight in the last year. They were laughing, and while I knew they didn’t mean any harm, it rubbed me the wrong way. 

In a moment of frustration, I decided to confront them. I said something like, ""You guys are really shallow for making fun of her like that, especially on her birthday."" They laughed it off, but I could tell it made things awkward. 

Then, Sarah overheard me and came over, looking a bit taken aback. I thought I was standing up for her, but she said something like, ""I can handle my friends. You didn’t need to say that."" I felt embarrassed and realized I may have overstepped. 

The rest of the night felt tense. People were trying to lighten the mood, but I could sense that I had created an awkward atmosphere. I regret how I handled the situation, but at the same time, I felt frustrated with those friends for making those comments in the first place.

Now I’m left wondering if I was in the wrong for speaking up or if I should have just let it go. So, AITA for calling out my friends at Sarah's birthday party?",489,2055,0.64,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_22988,2022-10-09 00:00:00,ESH,1930,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I've been friends with Jessica [30F] for about 8 years. We met in college and quickly became close, sharing everything from life struggles to triumphs. A couple of years back, she went through a tough breakup, and during that time, I really stepped up to support her emotionally. I listened to her vent, gave advice, and encouraged her to move on.

Recently, though, I've noticed that Jessica has become very clingy. She seems to rely on me for all her emotional needs, which can be exhausting. When she's had a bad day or is feeling insecure, she’ll call me multiple times, often late at night, expecting me to drop everything to talk. I care about her, but it feels like she's become overly dependent on me, and I struggle to balance that with my own life. 

So, I decided to set some boundaries. I told her that while I’m always here for her, I need her to respect my time and understand that I can’t always be available, especially at night when I’m winding down or spending time with my partner. I suggested she try talking to a therapist to help her process her feelings, which I thought would give her more support and alleviate some pressure off our friendship.

Jessica took this really hard. She accused me of abandoning her and not being a true friend. She felt hurt that I didn’t want to be her emotional crutch anymore and told me I was being selfish. I was upset too, as I felt I was just being honest about my needs and trying to help her in a healthier way. We've since had a few arguments about this, and it's strained our friendship.

Now, I feel guilty for wanting to protect my own mental space, but at the same time, I think I might have been too harsh. Am I the asshole for trying to set boundaries, or is she overreacting?",377,1820,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_79913,2024-03-24 00:00:00,ESH,1745,AITA

At first, I laughed it off, but as the night progressed, his jabs became more frequent and personal.

I’ve been trying to support her, but I also feel like she’s projecting a lot of her insecurities onto him.

I even suggested that she could communicate her feelings to him instead of jumping to conclusions.

Sara got defensive and said I couldn’t possibly understand because I’ve never been in a long-term relationship. I told her that while I may not have personal experience, I’ve observed many relationships and know that communication is key. That’s when the conversation started to escalate. 

She accused me of being unsupportive and not taking her feelings seriously, while I felt she was being overly dramatic about a situation that could be resolved with a simple conversation. I ended up saying that she was being unreasonable and that if she wanted a fairytale romance, she might need to adjust her expectations.

That really hurt her feelings, and she left the cafe upset. Later, I texted her to apologize for my tone but stood by my opinion. She hasn’t responded and is now giving me the cold shoulder.

Everyone sucks here,"Alright, here goes my story. 

So, a few months ago, I was helping my friend Sarah plan her wedding. She was super stressed about everything, and I offered to take on some of the planning tasks to lighten her load. We’ve been friends for years, and I genuinely wanted to help her make her big day special.

Sarah had a specific vision for her wedding theme, and I was excited to help her execute it. However, she was a bit of a control freak and had a hard time letting go of certain details. At one point, she insisted on using a very particular shade of blue for everything—tablecloths, flowers, even the bridesmaid dresses. 

I went ahead and ordered the flowers, but I accidentally selected a different shade of blue that was still pretty but not what she wanted. When I realized my mistake, I panicked. Instead of owning up to it, I tried to fix it by adding in some white and yellow flowers to soften the blow, thinking maybe she wouldn’t notice the difference or would like the change.

When the flowers arrived, Sarah was furious. She felt like I had completely disregarded her vision, and she was right to be upset. In my head, I thought I was being creative and trying to make things better, but I should have just communicated with her instead of trying to fix it on my own.

In the heat of the moment, Sarah snapped at me and said I was ruining her wedding. I snapped back and told her that she was being overly dramatic and that it was just flowers. We both ended up saying hurtful things and made the situation worse than it needed to be.

Afterwards, I felt awful and tried to apologize, but the damage was done. She felt betrayed that I hadn’t been honest with her, and I felt like she had overreacted. Neither of us really handled the situation well, and the whole experience left a sour taste in both of our mouths.

On the first night, we set up our camp and started a fire. As the sun went down, we began to relax, tell stories, and enjoy our drinks. However, as the night went on, one of my friends, let's call him Jake, started to get a bit rowdy. He was drinking more than everyone else and began to make some inappropriate jokes that made a few of us uncomfortable.

I tried to lighten the mood by joking back, but Jake just leaned into it, getting louder and more obnoxious. At one point, he started making jokes about one of our other friends' family situation, which I thought crossed a line. I called him out, saying he needed to stop being a jerk. Jake didn't take this well and started telling me to lighten up, saying it was just harmless fun.

Feeling frustrated, I decided to take things up a notch. I started mocking Jake back, imitating his voice and exaggerating his stupid jokes. Everyone else was uncomfortable, but a couple of friends laughed, which encouraged me to keep going. I knew I was being harsh, but I wanted to teach him a lesson about being sensitive to others.

I’m a 27-year-old woman, and I have a younger brother, Jake, who is 24. Our parents have been divorced for about five years now, and the split was really messy. My dad had an affair, which destroyed our family dynamic. My mom struggled for a long time, but she’s been doing much better since she started therapy and found a new job.

Thanksgiving this year was supposed to be a peaceful family gathering at my mom’s house. We invited a few close relatives, and everything was going well until Jake decided to bring his girlfriend, Megan, who I’ve never really liked. Megan has a tendency to be pretty rude, and she often makes snide comments about our mom, which bothers me a lot.

When they arrived, I tried to be cordial, but it quickly became clear that Megan was in a mood. She started making sarcastic comments about the food, and at one point, she even remarked that it was ""too healthy"" for her taste. I couldn’t just sit there and let her disrespect our mom, so I snapped and told her that if she didn't like it, she could just leave. This escalated into a huge argument between me and Megan, and Jake ended up getting defensive.

Jake shouted at me for embarrassing him in front of his girlfriend, and I told him that he should be embarrassed for bringing someone so inconsiderate to our family gathering.

I texted him back saying I couldn’t make it because I was too exhausted and needed to take care of some personal stuff.

Jake was understandably upset. He replied saying that he had counted on me and now had to scramble to find another ride. I felt guilty but also kind of annoyed that he didn’t understand how tiring my job can be. To make matters worse, when he finally found a ride, he ended up being late for his appointment, which added to his stress.

At one point, a couple at the table next to us began arguing. It started off quietly, but it escalated pretty quickly. They were raising their voices, and it was hard not to overhear them. My friends and I exchanged glances, concerned about the scene unfolding next to us.

Some of us are trying to enjoy our meal here!” The couple stopped and stared at him, clearly taken aback. The guy from the arguing couple shot back, “Mind your own business!” which only made Mark more fired up.

At that point, I felt the need to step in. I said to Mark, “Dude, just let them handle their own stuff. You don’t need to make it worse.” I thought it was unnecessary for him to escalate the situation. Mark shot back at me, saying that I was being a coward for not speaking up when I could. 

This whole thing turned into a shouting match at the coffee shop. Our friends were visibly uncomfortable, and the couple ended up leaving in a huff, while Mark and I kept arguing back and forth. Some people were staring at us, and I felt embarrassed about the whole scene.

I was excited to showcase my skills and hopefully win, as I had been planning my entry for weeks.

My boyfriend (32M) has always admired my cooking but has never really taken it seriously as a hobby for himself.

At first, I appreciated his enthusiasm, but as it got closer to the competition, I felt like he was trying to take over my process.

I got frustrated and snapped at him, saying I didn’t need his input and that I was the one who had put in all the work to develop my recipe. He got defensive, saying he was just trying to help and that I was being ungrateful.

After a heated argument, we agreed to respect each other's space. I thought we had resolved it, but the next day, he announced to our friends that he would be entering the competition too, using a variation of the recipe I had developed. He had told them that he was inspired by me but wanted to put his own twist on it. I felt blindsided and hurt. I told him that it felt like he was trying to overshadow my hard work, especially since he hadn't even been baking seriously until I announced my plans.

He insisted that he had every right to enter the competition and that I should be happy he was taking an interest in baking. I argued that it felt unfair since he was using my ideas and tools but acting like he was doing something completely original. We ended up in a big argument, and now we're both feeling upset about it.

I know we both contributed to the tension, and I can see how my reaction might have come off as dismissive. At the same time, I can’t help but feel that he didn’t respect my efforts and turned my passion into a competition. Now we're both feeling frustrated with each other, and I'm not sure how to move forward without it lingering between us.",572,1788,0.86,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_33480,2019-08-01 00:00:00,ESH,2398,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, I (28F) have a friend, Claire (27F), who recently got into a relationship with a guy named Jake (30M). Initially, I was supportive, but as I got to know him better, I started having serious concerns about his behavior.

Jake has this habit of making rude jokes about people’s appearances, and it's not just harmless teasing. He once made a comment about a mutual friend’s weight that was downright cruel. When I called him out on it, he just laughed and said I was being too sensitive. I was upset, but I let it go for Claire's sake. 

However, things escalated when he started talking about politics. He has some extreme views and often makes derogatory remarks about people who don't share his beliefs. I tried to engage him in a conversation about tolerance, but he just dismissed my concerns and told me to ""stop being so politically correct."" It got to the point where I felt uncomfortable hanging out with them because I didn't want to be around his negativity.

I finally confronted Claire about it. I expressed my worries and told her that I thought he was toxic for her. Instead of being thankful for my concern, she got really defensive and accused me of trying to control her life. I was frustrated, so I ended up saying some pretty harsh things about Jake, calling him a loser and saying she could do better.

Now, all three of us are in this awkward situation. Claire feels like I betrayed her trust, Jake thinks I'm just a jealous person trying to ruin their relationship, and I feel guilty for overstepping. I thought I was being a good friend, but now I’m not sure. 

It feels like we all messed up in different ways, and I just don’t know how to fix it. AITA?",473,1162,0.71,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_18339,2019-07-25 00:00:00,ESH,1680,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Hi everyone,

I could really use some perspective on a situation that happened recently.

So, I (30F) have a younger sister (25F) who has been in a serious relationship for about three years now. She’s been dating this guy (let's call him Jake) who has always seemed a bit off to me. He can be overly critical and often makes jokes at her expense, which I’ve tried to address with her, but she brushes it off and insists he’s just joking. 

A few weeks ago, we were at a family gathering, and during a game night, Jake made a particularly harsh comment about my sister’s cooking, which really upset her. I couldn’t hold my tongue anymore, so I snapped at him for being rude and said he should be more supportive of her. He responded with a sarcastic “thanks for your input, sister,” and I shot back that if he treated her better, maybe she wouldn’t have to hear stuff like that from me.

Later that night, my sister confronted me, saying I embarrassed her in front of everyone and that I overstepped. I told her I was just looking out for her, but she insisted that I was being an asshole for calling her boyfriend out publicly. I wound up leaving the party early, feeling frustrated and hurt because I thought I was defending her.

Now, I can definitely see that I might have been a bit overboard in how I handled it. Instead of talking to her privately about my concerns, I made a scene at a family gathering, which wasn't fair to her or anyone else. However, I also feel that I was justified in standing up for her when she was being belittled.

Looking back, I realize that my sister is an adult who can make her own choices, even if I think they are wrong. I just wanted to protect her from someone who I feel doesn’t respect her. 

So, am I the asshole for how I reacted, or was I justified in defending my sister? 

Thanks for your feedback.",457,698,0.65,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_12741,2018-09-30 00:00:00,ESH,1848,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, I recently had a situation that left me feeling pretty torn and I’m not sure who was in the wrong. My brother has been dating this girl for about a year, and while they seemed happy, she’s been pretty demanding and controlling about certain things. For example, she doesn’t really like him hanging out with his friends unless she’s there, which is a huge red flag in my opinion.

Last weekend, my brother invited a few of us over for a game night, but his girlfriend insisted that he cancel it because she wanted to spend time with him instead. He was hesitant but ultimately agreed, which I thought was ridiculous. I mean, it's just a game night and he's allowed to have time with friends, right? 

Feeling frustrated, I decided to reach out to some of our friends and see if they still wanted to hang out, so we ended up gathering at my place instead. I sent my brother a message letting him know what was going on, thinking he’d appreciate the chance to have some fun regardless of his girlfriend’s wishes.

Well, my brother ended up showing up at my place with her in tow, and she was furious when she found out that he hadn’t canceled as she wanted. The atmosphere turned awkward really quickly. She ended up causing a scene, calling him out for not prioritizing her, and I could see my brother was uncomfortable, caught between us.

In the heat of the moment, I snapped at her, telling her that he should be able to spend time with family and friends without her acting like a gatekeeper. She shot back that I was being disrespectful and that I should have respected their relationship. I felt justified in standing up for my brother, but I think I may have crossed a line.

After they left, my brother called me to say that I shouldn’t have said anything and that he’s just trying to make things work with her. He also mentioned that I shouldn’t have gone behind his back to organize plans without giving him a heads up. 

Now I feel like an asshole for trying to defend him but also an asshole for possibly overstepping. My brother is caught in the middle, and I honestly don’t know what to think. Was I in the wrong for my outburst, or was she being unreasonable? ESH, right?",916,2903,0.51,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_71974,2022-12-14 00:00:00,ESH,2188,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I recently got into a heated argument about how to manage our household responsibilities. We've been living together for a couple of years, and while we’ve always shared chores, it felt like I was picking up a lot of the slack lately. I work full-time, and my partner is in school, so I understand that they have a lot on their plate. 

But I got really frustrated when I noticed the laundry had piled up for weeks, the dishes were overflowing in the sink, and I was the one who had to vacuum and clean the bathroom. So one evening, after a long day at work, I lost my temper and confronted them about it. I told them I was tired of feeling like a maid and that they needed to step up and help out more. I may have raised my voice a bit, which I regret, but I felt like I was at my limit.

In response, my partner got defensive and said I was being unreasonable. They claimed that they were busy studying and that I should be more understanding. They also mentioned how I often complain about them taking breaks to relax instead of doing chores, which made them feel like they could never do anything right. I felt like every time I tried to express my feelings, they turned it into a personal attack on their efforts.

The argument escalated, with both of us saying hurtful things. I told them they were being lazy and they said I was being controlling. Afterward, we both felt bad about how we handled it. I know I shouldn’t have yelled, and I could have expressed my feelings in a better way. But at the same time, I feel like my partner could have been more receptive to my concerns instead of getting defensive.

He said something like, ""Lisa, if you keep eating those donuts, we'll have to put a warning label on you!"" 

I thought it was really out of line, so I called him out in front of everyone. I said, ""Dude, that’s not funny. Lay off her."" Instead of taking it seriously, he laughed it off and said, ""Lighten up, it’s just a joke!"" 

That made me even angrier, and I ended up shouting, ""Yeah, well, maybe you should grow up and learn that bullying isn’t humor!"" It got pretty tense, and everyone went quiet. Jake looked hurt, and Lisa just awkwardly smiled, trying to brush it off. 

Later, Jake confronted me in the break room, saying I overreacted and that I shouldn't have embarrassed him in front of everyone. I told him that he should own up to his actions and not hide behind the excuse of being ""just a joker."" He said I was being too sensitive and that it was just banter.

Everyone sucks here,"Last weekend, I went to a party at a friend's house. It was a pretty chill gathering with a mix of people, and I was having a good time catching up with everyone. At one point, I overheard a conversation between two guests, Sarah and Mike, about a personal issue. They were discussing how Sarah had been feeling overwhelmed with work and was struggling to balance her responsibilities. 

I thought it was a private conversation, but I had a moment of poor judgment and decided to jump in. I shared my own similar struggles but also threw in some unsolicited advice about how I managed my stress, which I now realize was unnecessary. It seemed to annoy Sarah, who clearly wanted to vent without any interruptions.

Later in the evening, I noticed that Sarah was sulking a bit and not engaging much with the group. I wanted to lighten the mood, so I made a joke about how “at least we’re not living in a dystopian novel” to which Mike replied, “Well, some of us are living in our own personal dystopia.” I took it as a cue to poke fun at Sarah’s situation, thinking it was all in good spirits. 

Instead of laughing, Sarah blew up at me, calling me insensitive and accusing me of making her feel worse. I felt defensive and snapped back, saying she was too sensitive and needed to lighten up. The atmosphere got really tense, and other guests started to look uncomfortable.

In the end, I apologized for my joke, but I felt I was justified in trying to lighten the mood. My friends think I was being an asshole for making fun of her situation, but I also feel that Sarah was too sensitive about her struggles.

I asked him if we could play it together, and he agreed. However, he was busy with some chores in between, so I ended up playing it solo for a bit while he was doing his thing.

When he finally sat down to play, I was in the middle of a level and ended up getting really invested. He sat next to me and started commenting on my gameplay, but I was so focused that I kind of shut him out. I didn't mean to, but I guess I was just in the zone.

After a while, Tom snapped and told me I was being really rude for not engaging with him while we played. I got defensive and said he could have just asked me to pause instead of yelling. We ended up arguing about it, and I accused him of being too sensitive, which just made him more upset.

In the heat of the moment, I ended up saying some things I didn’t mean, which I regretted later. I know that he wanted to have a fun time together, and I should have been more considerate of that. But I also felt like he overreacted to something that I thought was harmless.

As we began discussing the design, I expressed my vision of a cozy, minimalist aesthetic with neutral colors, while my partner was really into bright colors and a more eclectic style. I thought it would be fun to compromise and blend our styles, but my partner seemed set on their vision and didn’t want to incorporate much of mine. 

Things escalated when it came time to choose a sofa. I found one in a muted gray that I thought would fit perfectly with the theme I envisioned. My partner, however, had their heart set on a vibrant orange couch that stood out like a sore thumb to me. I told them I really didn’t like it and that it would clash with everything else. Instead of discussing it further, I ended up dismissing their choice and just ordered the gray couch without consulting them again.

When my partner came home and saw the new sofa, they were furious. They felt completely disregarded and said I had no right to make such a decision without them. I thought I was doing the right thing by making a choice I believed would look better, and I didn’t think it would upset them this much. I apologized, but I made it clear that I still thought my choice was better for the overall feel of the apartment.

I got frustrated and pointed out that he had been joking about how he could afford to splurge on a new gaming console just last week. He got defensive and said he had unexpected expenses come up.

So I (30F) was at the dog park with my golden retriever, Max. It was a busy Saturday afternoon, and the park was packed with dogs and their owners. Max is usually friendly and loves to play, but I keep a close eye on him to avoid any potential issues.

While I was chatting with a friend, I noticed a small dog—a chihuahua—running around. The owner, a woman (40s), seemed distracted and was on her phone while her dog was darting around. Max, being the friendly giant that he is, started to approach the little dog to say hello. 

As I called Max back, the chihuahua suddenly ran towards him, barking loudly. Max, startled, jumped back and knocked over the woman in the process. She fell to the ground but wasn’t hurt; it just startled her. I rushed over to help her up, apologizing profusely. But instead of accepting my apology, she started yelling at me, claiming I should have controlled my dog better.

Everyone sucks here,"I've been friends with Sarah for about five years, and we’ve always been there for each other. Recently, she went through a tough breakup, and I've been trying to support her as best as I can. However, things took a turn when she started to rely on me for more than just emotional support.

At first, I didn’t mind helping her out. I’d go over to her place, listen to her talk for hours, and even help her with her job applications. But soon, it became clear that she expected me to drop everything for her. She would call me in the middle of the night, asking me to come over because she was feeling lonely, or demand I cancel my plans just to hang out because she needed company.

As it went on, I started to feel drained. I’d tell her that I also had my own life to manage, but she would brush it off, saying that friends should be there for each other no matter what. This led to a few heated arguments where I ended up feeling guilty for wanting to prioritize my own needs.

One day, I snapped. Sarah had invited me to a party the night before but then texted me that she didn’t want to go anymore and asked if I could come over instead. I expressed that I was looking forward to the party and had already made plans with other friends. Instead of understanding, she blew up at me, calling me selfish and saying that I was abandoning her when she needed me the most.

In that moment, I lost my cool. I told her that I was tired of being her emotional crutch and that she needed to learn to handle her own problems without always relying on me. I ended my rant with “Maybe you should just find someone else to cling to,” and then I hung up on her.

Afterward, I felt guilty for how I had spoken to her, but I also felt justified in wanting my own space. I reached out to apologize a few days later, but she didn’t respond. Now, I feel stuck between wanting to support her and knowing I’ve crossed a line. I wish it hadn’t ended this way, but I can’t help but feel that we both messed up in this situation.",53,1065,0.95,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_64437,2024-08-15 00:00:00,ESH,2009,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Throwaway account because my family knows my main one. 

So, a bit of backstory: My sister, let’s call her Lisa, has always been very vocal about her dislike for the way my parents raised us. Growing up, they had certain expectations for us, and Lisa feels they favored me because I was the “smart” one. I’ll admit I did well in school, but I never asked for that kind of attention. Lisa struggled more academically and often felt overshadowed, which I completely understand.

Fast forward to a few months ago, Lisa had her first child, and she seemed to be over the moon. However, when she found out she was having a girl, she started expressing disappointment. She would say things like, “I wanted a mini-me, not a princess,” and “I hope she doesn’t become as much of a disappointment as I was.” It made me really uncomfortable hearing her talk about her daughter like that.

One day, during a family gathering, Lisa was lamenting about her daughter’s future—in her words, she was worried about her being “just another girl.” I didn’t want to let it slide this time, so I pointed out that she should be more positive and supportive of her daughter. I said something like, “You’re going to make her feel like she’s not good enough before she’s even born!” 

Well, that didn’t go over well. Lisa blew up and accused me of being a know-it-all and claimed I was just trying to make her feel worse about her feelings as a mother. I told her that she was projecting her insecurities onto her child, and it was unfair. Our parents overheard and jumped in, defending both of us and trying to mediate the situation.

Afterward, I felt guilty because I didn’t mean to put her down, but I also thought she needed a wake-up call. Lisa later confronted me, saying that I hurt her by making her feel like a bad mom. I apologized for how I said it but stood by what I meant. 

Now our family is strained, and I feel like we both contributed to the mess. Lisa believes I’m the worst for not being more supportive, and I can’t help but think she’s being overly sensitive. I just wanted her to see things differently. Am I wrong for feeling like we both crossed a line?",1,2626,0.71,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_54602,2018-08-09 00:00:00,ESH,2153,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I live with two friends, Alex and Jamie, in a small apartment. We all agreed to split the rent and chores evenly, but things have been getting tense lately. 

At first, everything was fine. We worked out a cleaning schedule and made sure to stick to it. But after a few months, I noticed that both Alex and Jamie started slacking off. Dishes piled up in the sink, trash overflowed, and the living room looked like a tornado hit it. I tried to talk to them about it, but they brushed me off, claiming they were busy with work and didn’t have time to clean.

Finally, after a particularly messy week, I snapped. I came home from work to find the entire apartment in disarray. I was already stressed, and seeing their mess pushed me over the edge. I gathered up all the dirty dishes, trash, and clutter and put it all in Alex's room. I figured since he never contributed to cleaning, he could deal with the consequences of his inaction.

When Alex got home, he was furious. He stormed into my room, yelling about how I invaded his space and made things worse. I yelled back, saying he should have cleaned up instead of leaving it for me to do. Jamie joined the argument, siding with Alex, and it quickly turned into a full-blown fight, with everyone shouting over each other.

Instead of resolving anything, we all ended up just venting our frustrations and saying things we didn’t mean. At one point, I told them they were being childish and that if they didn’t want to help with cleaning, they should just get used to living in their own filth. They shot back that I was being controlling and overreacting.

After the argument, we all just went to our rooms, and the atmosphere in the apartment was incredibly tense. I felt guilty for my part in escalating the situation, but I also felt justified since I had reached my breaking point. 

So, Reddit, AITA for dumping all the mess in Alex’s room and causing a huge fight?",227,1150,0.79,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_92647,2018-02-07 00:00:00,ESH,1920,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I went to a local coffee shop that I frequent and noticed a barista wearing a t-shirt with a very explicit and graphic image from a popular adult cartoon. The shirt itself wasn’t illegal or anything, but it was definitely inappropriate for a workplace where families and kids come in. I felt uncomfortable seeing something like that in a public place where I was trying to enjoy my coffee.

After my order, I mentioned to the barista that I thought the shirt was a bit too much for the environment. I didn’t mean to be rude, but I was honest about how it made me feel. The barista rolled her eyes and told me to lighten up, which made me feel even more frustrated. I ended up arguing with her about it, and it escalated to the point where the manager had to step in.

The manager, who I knew personally, sided with the barista, saying that everyone has the right to express themselves. I felt embarrassed for saying anything in the first place, but I also didn't think I was entirely wrong for being concerned. Ultimately, I decided to leave a review online expressing my thoughts about the experience, and it got mixed responses from others who either supported me or thought I overreacted.

I feel like I could have handled the situation differently and maybe chose not to confront the barista, but at the same time, I didn’t think I was out of line for wanting a more family-friendly atmosphere. So, AITA?",363,1435,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_89598,2018-05-09 00:00:00,ESH,1408,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Last month, my best friend threw a surprise birthday party for me, which I was really excited about. She invited a lot of our mutual friends, but she also invited some people I hadn’t seen in a while, including my ex, who I had a pretty messy breakup with about a year ago. I had made it clear to her that I didn’t want to see him, and I thought she understood.

When I arrived at the party, I was shocked to see him there. I immediately felt uncomfortable, but my friend was super excited and said it would be fine. She assured me that he wouldn’t cause any trouble. I tried to enjoy the party, but I couldn’t shake off the anxiety of being around him.

At one point, my ex tried to approach me to say hi, and I panicked. I told my friend I couldn’t be around him and asked her to ask him to leave. She hesitated at first, saying it was my birthday and that it would create drama to kick him out. Frustrated, I made a scene and said something like, “If you don't want to kick him out, I’ll just leave!” 

Eventually, my friend did go up to him and told him he had to leave, which was pretty embarrassing for everyone. He left in a huff, and the mood of the party shifted. A lot of our friends were upset, claiming it was rude to kick him out, and they thought I overreacted. 

Later, I felt bad for putting my friend in that position and for ruining the vibe of the party. My friend was upset with me for making a scene, and I also felt bad for how my ex was treated.

Everyone sucks here,"I (27F) have been friends with my best friend Sarah (28F) for over a decade. We’ve been through a lot together, and I consider her more like a sister. Recently, Sarah started dating a guy named Jake (30M), and things have been moving pretty fast. I was happy for her at first, but then I started noticing some red flags. 

Jake tends to dominate conversations, dismisses Sarah’s opinions, and is overly critical of her choices. I tried to voice my concerns to Sarah, but she brushed them off, insisting that he was just passionate and that I was being overly protective. I didn’t want to push her away, so I backed off, hoping things would improve.

Fast forward a few weeks, and I noticed that Sarah seemed unhappy and more withdrawn. One night, after a long conversation with her, I finally lost my temper. I told her that I thought Jake was controlling and that I felt she was making a huge mistake by staying with him. I got really heated and maybe said some things I shouldn’t have. I told her that I didn’t recognize the person she had become since dating him, and that I was worried she was losing herself.

She was really upset and said I was being a bad friend for not supporting her choices. I tried to apologize, but she told me to give her space. Shortly after, I ended up venting about the situation to another friend, and I may have made some harsh comments about Jake and how he treats her.

Now, Sarah hasn’t spoken to me in over a week, and I feel terrible about the way I reacted. I genuinely care for her and just want her to be happy, but I also don’t want to see her get hurt. I know I shouldn’t have lashed out, but I was just so worried for her.

Everyone sucks here,"I work at a medium-sized marketing agency where I’ve been employed for about three years. Recently, we brought on a new hire named Sarah, who has a fantastic portfolio but can be a bit intense in her approach to collaboration. Initially, I tried to be friendly and supportive, showing her the ropes and inviting her to join our brainstorming sessions. However, it quickly became apparent that Sarah has a tendency to dominate conversations and dismiss others' ideas outright.

For instance, during our first team meeting, I suggested a campaign idea that I thought could resonate well with our target audience. Sarah not only shot it down but went on to say that it was ""amateurish"" and that we should only pursue ""professional-level"" concepts. This wasn’t an isolated incident; she has done this multiple times since, often belittling the contributions of both me and my colleagues. It has created a pretty tense atmosphere.

After weeks of trying to involve her and give her constructive feedback, I decided to take a different approach. I stopped engaging with her during meetings unless absolutely necessary and began to withdraw from collaborating with her on projects. My colleagues followed my lead, and we essentially formed a united front to limit interaction with her. We would sit together during lunch, excluding her from our discussions, which made it clear we were unhappy with the way she treated us.

Sarah, feeling ostracized, approached our manager to express her concerns about the team dynamics. Our manager called for a meeting to address the issue, and I was frustrated because I felt like we were being unfairly painted as the antagonists. In that meeting, I admitted we were avoiding her but justified it by explaining how she was dismissive and unkind. The conversation grew heated as Sarah defended her approach, claiming that she was just trying to uphold a high standard.

In the end, the meeting didn’t resolve anything. It just made everyone feel more uncomfortable and brought the tension to the surface. I feel bad for how we’ve treated her, but I also believe she needs to be held accountable for her actions. I guess I’m stuck wondering if I’m in the wrong here along with my colleagues or if we all share some blame in this situation. So, am I the asshole for how I've handled this?",526,1232,0.76,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_22659,2020-02-17 00:00:00,ESH,2317,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Hello, throwaway because I don’t want anyone to recognize me.

I'm a 25M and I've been living with my roommate (26M) for about a year. We get along well for the most part, but he has a habit of joking around that sometimes crosses the line. He often makes fun of my hobbies, which can be pretty frustrating. For example, I'm really into video games and he constantly teases me about playing ""childish"" games, calling them a waste of time. 

Recently, I started working on a new personal project that I'm really passionate about. It’s a game design project I’ve been putting a lot of effort into, and I wanted to focus on it. One night, while I was deeply engrossed in my work, my roommate barged into my room with a couple of his friends and started mocking me about it. He said things like, ""Hey, are you designing a game for five-year-olds?"" and ""Hope you’re not planning on making a 'How to Be a Loser' simulator.""

I tried to ignore them and keep working, but they kept going. At one point, I snapped and yelled, ""Can you just shut up for once? Not everything is a joke, and I’m sick of your constant negativity!"" 

His friends looked shocked, and he just stood there silent for a moment before leaving the room. The next day, he confronted me and said I overreacted and made him feel bad for trying to have fun. I told him that I was really trying to focus on something important to me, and his jokes felt hurtful. 

We ended up arguing, and he accused me of not being able to take a joke. I admitted that I could have handled my frustration better, but I also felt he should understand that not everything is a joke, especially when someone is working hard on something they care about.

Everyone sucks here,"So, a few weeks ago, my friend Alex invited me over for a small gathering at his place. It was supposed to be a relaxed evening with a few friends, and I was looking forward to it. However, I found out that my ex-girlfriend, Sarah, who I had a pretty messy breakup with, was also invited. I hadn't seen her in months, and to be honest, I wasn't thrilled about the idea of running into her.

As the evening progressed, the atmosphere was surprisingly friendly. Alex had set up some games, and we were all having a good time. I was trying to ignore the tension I felt about Sarah being there, but eventually, we ended up sitting across from each other during a game of charades. Things were okay until it was my turn to act something out, and I accidentally mimicked a very embarrassing moment from our relationship that everyone remembered.

To lighten the mood, I jokingly said, ""I know this is a little too close to home for Sarah,"" and everyone laughed, including Sarah, but I could see she was uncomfortable. After the game, we all took a break, and I overheard Sarah talking to another friend of mine, Jenna. She was venting about how I was being a jerk for bringing up our past in front of everyone, and it made her feel awful.

Feeling a bit defensive, I walked over and said, “I was just trying to have fun! It’s not my fault if you can’t take a joke.” Sarah shot back that I was being insensitive and that I should be more considerate of her feelings since we had broken up on such bad terms. I retorted that maybe she should just get over it already since it was in the past.

The argument escalated, and other friends started to notice. Jenna tried to mediate, but it just turned into a group discussion about how both of us were being immature. It ended with Sarah leaving the gathering early, visibly upset, and I felt a mix of guilt and irritation. Later, Alex told me that I should have just kept my mouth shut to avoid drama and that I was being an asshole for bringing up our history.

Now I'm left wondering if I was wrong for joking around or if Sarah overreacted. Was I the asshole for bringing up our past and making her uncomfortable, or did she need to lighten up? Everyone seemed to agree that we both handled it poorly, so I guess my question is: Am I the asshole here?",453,2454,0.77,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_71248,2018-06-21 00:00:00,ESH,2293,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Last weekend, I (24F) went to a small outdoor concert with some friends. We arrived a bit late and found a spot on the grass where we could see the stage. The atmosphere was lively, and everyone was excited to hear the performances.

Not long after we settled in, a couple (let's say they were in their early 30s) set up right next to us. They brought a large cooler and started drinking, which was fine at first. But as the concert went on, they got increasingly loud and rowdy. They were singing along to every song, but not in a fun way—more like they were trying to outshout the band.

At one point, they started arguing about something trivial and were yelling at each other right next to us. It was distracting and honestly kind of awkward, so I turned to my friends and said, ""Wow, they're really ruining the vibe."" I didn’t intend for them to hear me, but they did, and the guy shot me a dirty look.

Feeling bold, I decided to confront them directly. I went over and said, “Hey, could you please keep it down a bit? We’re all here to enjoy the music.” The woman laughed and said, “It’s a concert, we’re supposed to have fun!” and I replied, “Yeah, but you’re kind of taking the fun away from everyone else.”

It escalated from there, with her telling me to lighten up and me insisting that they were being inconsiderate. Eventually, they moved a little farther away, but the atmosphere was already tense. My friends were mixed on whether I overstepped or if I was justified in saying something. Looking back, I feel like I could have handled it better, but I also think they were being pretty thoughtless.

Recently, she decided to quit her job, buy a one-way ticket to Europe, and travel for a few months. I was shocked but didn't want to rain on her parade, so I tried to be supportive.

A few weeks before she left, she came to me asking for a loan of $2,000 to help fund her trip. I was hesitant because I knew she had a history of not paying back loans and I didn’t want to be the bank. I told her that I would be willing to help her if she could show me a solid plan for how she would manage her finances while traveling. She got upset and said that I was being controlling and unsupportive.

In response, I became frustrated and pointed out how her lack of financial responsibility would likely lead to her getting into trouble abroad, which I didn’t want to see happen. I told her that if she really wanted to go, she'd need to figure it out on her own because I didn’t want to enable her reckless behavior. This led to a heated argument where I might have accused her of being irresponsible and selfish.

She ended up leaving for her trip without any financial support from me, and now I feel a bit guilty. I worry that I might have pushed her away when all she wanted was my help. But at the same time, I feel like I was right to stand my ground.

A week before the trip, my partner's best friend had a falling out with her partner, and she asked if she could join us since she needed to get away. I felt bad for her, so I agreed, even though I was looking forward to some alone time with my partner. We figured it would be fine since we all get along.

My partner agreed but then turned to her friend and asked if she wanted to come along as well. I was frustrated and expressed that I wanted some time alone with my partner. 

We ended up having a big argument. I called my partner inconsiderate for not understanding my needs, and she accused me of being selfish for wanting to exclude her friend. Things escalated, and I said some hurtful things about how her friend was a third wheel. After that, my partner was very upset and decided to leave the dinner table to go talk to her friend.

However, things took a turn when I had to share some news of my own. I had been offered a new job that I was excited about, which meant I would be moving to a new city. I thought it’d be a good thing to share, but when I told Sarah, she completely shut down. She didn't respond positively at all, which surprised me.

Everyone sucks here,"I (29F) recently had a pretty explosive argument with my neighbor (30sM) over a parking situation that escalated out of control, and now I’m not sure how to feel about it.

I live in a small apartment complex where parking is limited. I usually park in my designated spot, but sometimes I temporarily park in a visitor space if my spot is occupied. Well, a few days ago, I came home late from work and found that my spot was taken, so I parked in the visitor spot. 

The next morning, I woke up to a note on my car from my neighbor, who was clearly annoyed. The note was rude and condescending, suggesting that I had no respect for the community rules. I felt pretty defensive, especially since I try to be a good neighbor. I took it personally and decided to confront him.

When I saw him outside, I confronted him about the note. I told him that he didn’t need to be rude and that I had a valid reason for parking where I did. He responded by calling me entitled and said that I was the reason why people in the complex couldn’t get along. I lost my temper and called him a self-righteous jerk and told him to mind his own business. 

The argument escalated, and I’ll admit I said some pretty harsh things. I called him a “nobody with too much time on his hands” and told him to get a life. He yelled back, saying that I was a bad neighbor and didn’t care about anyone but myself. 

After that, I felt pretty bad about how it all went down. I might have overreacted to the note, and I recognize that I didn’t have to insult him. But I also feel like he could have approached me in a nicer way instead of leaving a passive-aggressive note. 

Now, I’ve been avoiding him, and every time I see him, I get this knot in my stomach. My friends think I should just let it go and apologize, but I’m still upset about how he approached me.

Everyone sucks here,"I (30F) recently got into a pretty heated argument with my brother (27M) about his girlfriend (22F). Let me explain the situation. 

My brother has been dating this girl for about a year now, and while I know he really likes her, I have some serious concerns about their relationship. For starters, she has a pretty tumultuous background; she’s been through a lot of personal issues and has moved from one place to another quite frequently. I get that everyone has their own struggles, but I worry that my brother, who has always been more stable, is getting in over his head by dating someone with so many unresolved problems.

Last week, my brother invited me over for dinner, and I noticed his girlfriend was acting pretty erratic. She got upset over a minor comment and started crying, which made the whole atmosphere awkward. I tried to be supportive, but I expressed my concern to my brother later that night, suggesting that maybe he should take a step back from the relationship until she gets her life sorted out. I thought I was just being a caring sister, looking out for him.

Well, my brother did not take it well. He accused me of being judgmental and told me that I had no right to interfere in his personal life. I tried to explain that I was coming from a place of love, but he just kept saying I was being overbearing and that he didn’t need my advice. In a fit of frustration, I mentioned that if I were in his shoes, I would be worried about how her past could affect him in the long run. 

To make matters worse, during our argument, I may have said some things that were out of line. I mentioned that I thought he could do better, which was pretty harsh and definitely came off as condescending. He ended up storming out of the room, and now he’s not talking to me.

Looking back, I realize that I might have pushed too hard, and I shouldn't have compared him to other relationships or implied he was making a mistake. But at the same time, I genuinely feel worried about him and just wanted to help.

Everyone sucks here,"I’ve always been a pretty casual person when it comes to meals, often opting for whatever is easiest to prepare. My best friend, Jamie, is the complete opposite; she loves cooking elaborate meals and prides herself on her culinary skills. Recently, she invited me over for dinner, and I was really excited because she always makes these amazing dishes.

When I arrived, I noticed the amount of work she had put into dinner. The table was beautifully set, and the smell of the food was incredible. However, as we sat down to eat, I realized she had made a dish I had an allergy to—shellfish. I felt bad because I didn't want to ruin the evening or offend her after all the effort she had put in, so I mentioned my allergy but said I could just pick around it and eat the sides. 

She seemed fine with that, but as we continued eating, I jokingly made a comment about how I would have gone with a simpler dish, like pasta or tacos, that could accommodate everyone. I didn’t mean to undermine her cooking, but she took it the wrong way and got visibly upset. She started defending her choice of dish, saying she didn’t invite me over just to serve “boring” food. I could tell she was hurt, and I felt bad, but I also thought she was being a little dramatic.

In the heat of the moment, I snapped and told her that if she wanted to impress someone, she should have considered their preferences, especially since she knew I had dietary restrictions. 

After dinner, she was quiet and I could tell our friendship was a bit strained. I apologized later through text, but it didn’t feel like enough.

Everyone sucks here,"I (24F) live with my boyfriend (25M) and his best friend (26M) in a small apartment. When we moved in together, I was excited thinking this would be a fun living situation. But I quickly realized that my boyfriend’s friend, let’s call him J, is incredibly messy and has no regard for shared spaces.

At first, I tried to be understanding since I know everyone has different levels of cleanliness. I would clean up after J and even asked my boyfriend to talk to him. But after a few months, it became too much. Dishes would pile up in the sink, food would go uneaten and rot in the fridge, and the living room always looked like a tornado hit it.

One day, I reached my breaking point when I came home to find an empty pizza box and leftover greasy food all over the coffee table. I snapped and confronted J. I said, “You can’t just leave your mess everywhere. This is our home, not a landfill.” He responded with, “Chill out, it’s just a little mess.” I was furious and yelled, “This isn’t just a little mess! You’re an adult; act like one!”

That evening, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I gathered up all of J’s trash, including the pizza box and any other food wrappers, and dumped it in his room. I thought this would send a clear message that his messes have consequences. 

The next morning, J came out looking furious. He confronted me in the living room, saying I had crossed a line. “Why would you do something so childish?” he asked. I replied, “I’m just showing you how it feels to live in a mess. Maybe now you’ll understand.” My boyfriend was caught in the middle and tried to mediate, saying we both needed to be more considerate of each other.

In the end, J cleaned up his room but it led to a huge fight.

Everyone sucks here,"I live with my partner in a small apartment, and we recently decided to host a dinner party for some friends. We both enjoy cooking, so we put a lot of effort into planning the menu and prepping everything.

A few days before the party, I noticed that my partner had bought some really expensive ingredients without discussing it with me first. I was a bit taken aback because we usually stick to a budget for our meals. When I brought it up, my partner brushed it off, saying it was a special occasion and worth the splurge. I wasn’t convinced, but didn’t want to ruin the excitement for the dinner, so I let it go.

On the day of the party, my partner was busy setting up the dining area while I was in the kitchen finishing the cooking. As I was plating the food, I realized that a lot of the expensive ingredients were being used in a way that I felt was wasteful, especially since we had guests with dietary restrictions. I tried to suggest alternatives, but my partner got defensive and said I was being controlling and that I should just let them handle it.

Frustrated, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I took some of the expensive ingredients and hid them in the back of the fridge, hoping to use them later for another meal where we could enjoy them properly. When my partner found out, they were furious. The dinner party was awkward as my partner kept glaring at me while trying to maintain a cheerful atmosphere for our guests.

After everyone left, we got into a huge argument. My partner accused me of sabotaging the dinner and not being supportive, while I felt disrespected for them not considering our budget or the dietary needs of our guests. We both said hurtful things to each other, and I ended up walking out for a while to cool off.

Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I were having a casual Saturday at home, and I decided to make some pancakes for breakfast. I usually add a bit of vanilla extract to the batter for extra flavor. When I reached for the extract, I noticed that it was almost out, so I thought, “Why not mix it with some almond extract to stretch it a bit?” I figured it might create a nice flavor combination.

When I poured the almond extract in, my partner walked in and immediately asked what I was doing. I told them about my plan to mix the two extracts. They flipped out, saying that almond extract is too overpowering and that I was ruining the pancakes. I felt defensive because I was just trying to be resourceful, so I argued back that they always like trying new things and that it could turn out great.

That’s when the argument escalated. They started yelling about how I should have just stuck to the recipe and how my “experimentation” always leads to disaster in the kitchen. I yelled back that they were being dramatic over pancakes and that it was just a little bit of extract. Things got heated, and we both ended up saying hurtful things that we didn’t mean.

Everyone sucks here,"tl;dr at end.

My friend Sarah and I are part of a small group that meets every week for game night. Recently, we decided to host a themed night where everyone would dress up as their favorite character from a popular video game. It was meant to be fun and a way to bring everyone together.

The day before the event, I was at a thrift store and found a really cool costume piece that I thought would make my outfit stand out. I posted a picture of it in our group chat, and everyone seemed excited about the theme. However, when I wore it to the event, Sarah, who had planned her costume around a similar character, started to get upset. 

Here’s what happened:

- When I arrived, Sarah immediately pointed out that I had stolen her idea, which I thought was a bit dramatic since we were all dressing as characters from the same game.
- I tried to explain that I didn’t copy her, and that I thought the costume piece was unique and would add to the night. 
- The other friends in the group started to pick sides. Some agreed with Sarah and said I should have consulted her first, while others thought it was silly to get upset over a costume.
- The tension escalated throughout the night. Sarah made snide comments every time I spoke, and I retaliated by pointing out that her character isn’t even that original either.
- At one point, I jokingly suggested that we should switch costumes for the sake of the night. She took this seriously and refused to talk to me for the rest of the evening, claiming I was trying to undermine her.

In the end, the night was awkward, and I felt like we both contributed to ruining the fun. I didn’t mean to upset Sarah, but I also felt like she overreacted to something that was supposed to be lighthearted. 

So, Reddit, are we both the assholes here?

Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I have been living with my sister and her kids for a few months now. It wasn’t our plan, but we had to move out of our apartment due to some unforeseen financial issues. My sister graciously offered us her spare room, and we’ve been trying to make it work.

Things have generally been smooth, but I admit I’ve been a bit short-tempered lately. My sister has two kids, a 10-year-old boy and a 7-year-old girl. They can be loud and messy, which usually doesn’t bother me, but I’m a bit overwhelmed with work and adjusting to this new living situation. 

A few days ago, I was working from home, trying to focus on a deadline. My partner was out running errands, and I had the house to myself, or so I thought. I had closed the door to our room to minimize distractions. However, my sister’s kids were playing in the living room, and I could hear them arguing and yelling. I tried to ignore it, but after about an hour, I lost my temper. I opened the door and yelled at them to keep it down, which startled them. I realized afterward that I might have gone too far; they were just kids having fun.

That same evening, my sister confronted me about my outburst. She was understandably upset and said I shouldn’t take my stress out on her kids. I acknowledged that I was wrong to yell at them, but I was also frustrated that she didn’t do anything to manage the noise while I was working.

In a moment of irritation, I told her it wasn’t fair that I had to deal with her kids' noise while trying to work from home, especially when we were living in her house. It got heated, and she snapped back that I needed to be more understanding since we were all living together, and it was a temporary situation.

Now, I feel guilty for how I handled things. I shouldn’t have yelled at her kids, but I also think she could have been more considerate of my work situation.

When everyone arrived, I noticed that one of my friends, Jake, brought a bottle of wine to share, which I thought was great. As the night went on, we all enjoyed the food and drinks. However, I noticed that Jake was drinking more than anyone else and seemed to be hogging the wine. By the end of the night, he had finished off most of the bottle and was noticeably tipsy.

When it was time to clean up, I realized that the snacks and drinks I had provided had barely been touched compared to the wine that Jake consumed. I felt frustrated and mentioned to the group how it didn’t seem fair that I spent so much time and money preparing food, while Jake just brought one bottle and drank most of it.

Jake got defensive and said that he was just trying to contribute to the night and that I shouldn't be upset over one bottle of wine. Our other friends chimed in, saying that I should just let it go and that Jake had every right to enjoy the wine he brought. I felt like I was being unreasonable for wanting to address it, but at the same time, I thought it was unfair that my efforts were overlooked.

Everyone sucks here,"Backstory: I live in a small town where everyone knows each other. There's a local coffee shop that serves as a community gathering place. I’ve been going there for years and have developed friendships with the staff and regulars.

Event that I am questioning if I am an asshole: Recently, I noticed that a new barista named Sarah was having a rough time. She was slow and seemed overwhelmed during the morning rush, which is usually very busy. One day, I was waiting for my coffee and got frustrated because I was late for work. I jokingly said to my friend, who was also waiting, “At this rate, I’m going to have to start brewing my own coffee at home!” I thought it was a light-hearted comment, but Sarah overheard me and looked visibly upset.

Later, I felt bad about my comment, but I didn’t say anything to her. Instead, I decided to post a funny meme about “waiting for coffee like it’s a life or death situation” on my social media and tagged the coffee shop. I didn’t mention Sarah specifically, but I know the staff saw it. A couple of my friends commented, and it turned into a thread about how slow the service had been lately, which I know wasn’t fair to Sarah.

The next time I went to the coffee shop, Sarah seemed even more stressed and avoided eye contact with me. I tried to be friendly, but she just took my order without saying much. I later found out from another barista that Sarah had been feeling really down about her job performance, and my post had contributed to her feeling insecure.

When I thought about it, I realized I shouldn’t have made that joke, and I shouldn’t have posted the meme either. It was insensitive, and I feel like I contributed to a negative environment for her. At the same time, Sarah could have asked for help or communicated her struggles better.

I rented a venue, invited all her friends, and coordinated decorations and food, which took a lot of time and effort. 

Now, here’s where the problem started. A few days before the party, my friend’s mom called me, saying she wanted to throw her a small family gathering on the same day. I was taken aback because I had already committed to the surprise party and didn’t want to ruin the plans. I explained the situation to her mom, emphasizing how much my friend would love the party I had planned. The mom seemed understanding and said she would talk to my friend about it.

Fast forward to the day of the party, and I arrive at the venue to set everything up. I planned for my friend to arrive just before everyone shouted ""surprise!"" But when she walked in, her mom and family were already there in the same venue, completely unaware of my plans. My friend looked confused and torn between the two celebrations. I felt my heart sink, and I was furious at her mom for not keeping her promise to me.

In a moment of frustration, I confronted her mom in front of everyone about how she ruined what was supposed to be a surprise. The tension escalated, and I ended up shouting, “This was supposed to be a surprise for her, not a family obligation!” It was awkward, and my friend looked really upset, caught in the middle.

These traditions meant a lot to me, as they were some of my happiest memories. However, over the past few years, my sister has become increasingly vocal about her desire to celebrate the holidays differently. She wants to have a more low-key, minimalist approach, focusing on experiences rather than decorations or big meals. 

This year, my sister decided she didn’t want to decorate our parents’ house for Christmas at all. She suggested that we should skip the tree and just meet up for dinner on Christmas Day instead. When I heard this, I was really upset. I felt like she was trying to erase our family traditions, and it felt disrespectful to the memories we had built over the years.

In response, I confronted her about it. I was frustrated and told her that she was being selfish for wanting to change something that meant so much to not just me, but to our parents as well. I even suggested that if she didn’t want to participate in the typical celebrations, she could just sit it out instead of trying to ruin it for everyone else. My words were harsher than I intended, but I was just really passionate about keeping our traditions alive.

She fired back, saying that I was being overly sentimental and that I needed to accept that not everyone wants to celebrate in the same way. She accused me of trying to control how everyone else feels about the holidays. This made me feel defensive, and I ended up saying things I didn't mean, including that she was ruining Christmas for everyone.

Everyone sucks here,"I’m 26 and recently moved in with my best friend, who’s 27 and a single mom to a 5-year-old. I’ve been trying to help out around the house, but I feel like I’m getting pulled into a lot more than I anticipated. My friend and her ex have this very complicated relationship where he constantly comes to her for everything. He’ll show up unannounced, often needing to borrow things or asking for favors, and my friend just can’t say no to him. 

So a few days ago, I was having a rough day. I had a job interview that didn’t go well, and I was feeling really down about myself. In the middle of my evening, her ex texts her to say he’s out of gas and stranded somewhere. My friend drops everything, gets ready, and says she’s going to pick him up. I was shocked and told her that it wasn’t right for him to rely on her like this, especially since he never seems to reciprocate. She got defensive and said he was just trying to be a good dad, and how would I feel if it were my kid in that situation? 

I blurted out that I thought she was enabling him and that if she kept helping him out, he would never learn to take care of himself. She got really upset, and we ended up arguing. I felt bad afterward, but I was also just so frustrated with the whole situation. 

Later that night, after she came back, I tried to apologize and explain my point of view, but she was still hurt and accused me of being unsupportive. I felt like I was just trying to look out for her, but maybe I overstepped. I can see where she’s coming from too, and I didn’t mean to make her feel bad about trying to help the father of her child. 

I don’t know if I was the asshole for saying something or if she was for being so defensive. It feels like we both mishandled the situation, but I genuinely want what’s best for her and her son.",167,541,0.67,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_13397,2020-11-28 00:00:00,ESH,1811,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My sister and I have always had a rocky relationship, but it really hit the fan recently. We both have kids, and we decided to plan a family vacation together. I was excited about the idea of our kids getting to bond, but I quickly discovered that my sister and I have very different parenting styles.

I’m more laid-back and let my kids have some freedom, while my sister is quite strict and has a lot of rules. When we were planning the trip, my sister insisted on a strict itinerary that included early wake-up times, scheduled activities, and no deviations from the plan. I was okay with some structure, but I also wanted our kids to have time to just relax and play.

The tensions really escalated when we got to the beach. My kids wanted to build sandcastles and play in the water, but my sister insisted that we stick to the schedule and wanted to drag everyone to a scheduled ""educational"" tour of a nearby museum. I pushed back, saying the kids were having a great time and we could always go to the museum later. This led to a big argument between us in front of the kids.

During the argument, I said some pretty hurtful things, like how her parenting style was ruining the trip and how she should loosen up a bit. She retaliated by calling me irresponsible and saying I was setting a bad example for the kids. We ended up shouting at each other, and it was really uncomfortable for everyone involved.

After we calmed down, I apologized for my tone, but I didn't really take back what I said about her parenting. I still think she could have been more flexible, and she believes I’m too lax. The whole trip ended up feeling tense, and the kids were caught in the middle.

Now, my sister is still upset with me, and honestly, I feel like I didn’t handle it well either. I shouldn’t have let it escalate to that point, but I also feel like she could have been more understanding.

Everyone sucks here,"So last week, my friends and I decided to go out for dinner at this new restaurant that just opened up. We were really excited to try the food. We made a reservation for a group of six. When we arrived, the place was packed, and the atmosphere was pretty loud. 

Once we were seated, we started to look at the menu, and I noticed that one of my friends, who had been quiet the whole time, seemed a bit off. I asked her if she was okay, and she said she didn’t feel well and didn’t think she could eat much. I suggested she could just order a small appetizer instead of a full meal. She agreed and ordered some fries.

As we started to eat, the conversation got lively, and I noticed that she was barely touching her fries. I jokingly said, “Hey, are you on a diet or something? Those fries look sad!” I said it with a laugh, but she didn’t respond well. She looked upset and said something like, “Yeah, maybe I just don’t feel like eating much tonight.” I felt a bit awkward after that and tried to change the subject, but it felt kind of tense.

As the night went on, I made a couple more jokes about her not eating much, trying to lighten the mood, but it only seemed to make things worse. Eventually, she just got up and left the table without saying anything. The rest of my friends were annoyed with me and said I should have been more considerate of her feelings.

I genuinely didn’t mean to hurt her feelings; I thought we were just joking around like we usually do. But now I’m wondering if I was the jerk for making those comments or if she overreacted. I feel like I should have been more aware, but at the same time, I thought we were all just having fun.

Everyone sucks here,"I (32M) share a small apartment with my girlfriend (30F) and her brother (28M) because we all lost our jobs during the pandemic and decided to pool our resources. It's not the ideal situation, and things have been tense between us because we all have different lifestyles and ways of doing things.

For context, I take my work seriously and have been trying to find a job in my field. I usually keep to myself and spend a lot of time in my room focused on my job search. My girlfriend works from home and has a more flexible schedule, while her brother is a freelancer who works late at night and sleeps during the day. This leads to a lot of friction in the house, especially with noise levels and our different routines.

I admit I have been a bit of an asshole in the past when it comes to my girlfriend's brother. I’ve snapped at him when he makes noise late at night while I’m trying to sleep or when he leaves his dirty dishes piled up in the sink. I know I can be pretty harsh about it, but it drives me crazy to see the mess, especially when I'm trying to keep things organized.

Recently, there was a situation that escalated. One evening, I was on a video call for a job interview. I was dressed up and trying to be professional, and I had my door closed. During the call, her brother chose that moment to come into the living room, completely unaware that I was in the middle of something important. He turned on the TV loud enough that I couldn’t hear the interviewer at all. I ended up having to yell at him to turn it down, which made me feel terrible because I know he was just trying to unwind after a long day.

After the call, I confronted him in the kitchen, and it turned into a really heated argument. I called him inconsiderate and said he doesn’t respect my need for quiet when I’m working. He fired back, saying that I was acting like a dictator in our shared space and that I have no right to demand silence when he pays rent too.

In that moment, I lost control and told him that if he can't be respectful, he should find somewhere else to live. I immediately regretted saying that because I know how hard it is for him to find affordable housing, but I was just so frustrated.

Now, I feel guilty for how I handled the situation, but I also think he should have been more aware of what was going on. So, am I the asshole here?",635,1385,0.84,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_72911,2024-08-26 00:00:00,ESH,2353,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My sister and I have always had a pretty rocky relationship. We’re very different people—she’s outgoing and social, while I tend to be more introverted and reserved. Despite our differences, we’ve managed to stay in touch over the years, but things have gotten tense lately.

A few weeks ago, my sister invited me to her engagement party. I was happy for her but also a bit overwhelmed. Social gatherings make me anxious, especially when they involve her large group of friends, most of whom I don’t know. When I confirmed my attendance, I told her I might leave early if I started to feel uncomfortable.

The day of the party came, and I tried to enjoy myself. I spoke to a few of her friends and smiled a lot, but I felt increasingly out of place as the night went on. At one point, my sister pulled me aside and insisted I join a group game that was happening. I tried to explain that I wasn’t really feeling it, but she pushed and pushed until I reluctantly agreed.

During the game, I felt more and more anxious and realized I really wanted to leave. So, I quietly slipped out without saying goodbye to anyone. The next day, I received a call from my sister. She was furious. She accused me of being rude and of ruining her engagement party by leaving early without telling anyone. I tried to explain that I was overwhelmed and that I thought it would be better for everyone if I just left quietly, but she wouldn’t listen.

In my frustration, I snapped back at her, calling her selfish for not considering my feelings and for forcing me into a situation that made me uncomfortable. We ended up yelling at each other, and I hung up feeling guilty but also justified in my feelings. 

Now, I feel torn. I know my sister was excited about her party and wanted everyone to have a good time, but I also feel like she should have respected my boundaries. I’ve apologized for leaving early, but she still hasn’t spoken to me since, and I worry that the situation has driven a wedge between us.

My friend has been going through a rough time with her job and is struggling financially. I’ve been fortunate enough to get a promotion, and my salary has increased significantly. In light of her difficulties, I’ve been trying to help her out by covering some of the groceries and paying for utilities, but I’m starting to feel taken advantage of. 

My friend often eats my snacks without asking, and when I bring home treats or meals that I look forward to, she doesn’t hesitate to finish them off. I tried bringing it up subtly, but she brushed it off and said I should just share. I explained that while I’m happy to help her out, I would appreciate it if she would ask before taking my food. 

In response, she got defensive and accused me of being selfish since I can afford to buy more. I snapped back that just because I can afford it doesn’t mean it’s fair for her to take what’s mine without asking. Now there’s tension between us, and I feel guilty for how I responded.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I was at a coffee shop working on my laptop when a couple of friends came in and sat at the table next to me. They were in the middle of a heated debate about something, and honestly, they were kind of loud. At first, I thought it was amusing, but it quickly became distracting as I tried to concentrate.

After about 20 minutes of their back-and-forth, I politely leaned over and said, ""Hey, would you mind keeping it down a bit? I'm trying to focus."" They both looked at me, surprised, and the girl in the pair said, ""Wow, sorry we’re not whispering like it’s a library. This is a coffee shop, you know.""

I felt kinda embarrassed, but I shrugged it off and went back to my work. A few minutes later, they started laughing loudly and making even more noise. I could feel my frustration rising, so I decided to take a break and get a refill. As I waited in line, I overheard them talking about me, calling me ""that guy who can’t handle some noise"" and how I was ""such a buzzkill.""

When I got my coffee, I couldn’t help myself. I went back to their table and said, ""Look, I get that you’re having fun, but it’s really hard for me to concentrate when you’re being so loud."" The guy replied, ""Maybe you should try working somewhere quieter then."" I rolled my eyes and said, ""Maybe you should be more considerate.""

At that point, I felt like the mood shifted, and other customers were starting to look over. I could see the couple exchanging glances like they were annoyed with me. I just walked back to my table, feeling flustered.

Later, I told my friends about it, and they had mixed opinions. Some said I was justified in asking them to be quieter, while others thought I was being overly sensitive.

I was really upset because she had promised me that she would cut ties, especially since they had a messy breakup. When I confronted her, we had a huge fight, and I ended up saying some hurtful things. I didn’t mean to, but I was just so angry and felt betrayed.

After that, I felt like I needed to keep an eye on her. I started checking her social media and her phone when she wasn’t around. She noticed and got really upset, saying that I was invading her privacy. I know I shouldn’t have done that, but I felt justified because I didn’t want to be blindsided again.

Things got a little better after we talked it out, but I still can’t shake the feeling that she might be hiding something. Just the other day, I saw her texting someone late at night, and when I asked about it, she got defensive and told me it was just a friend.

Later that night, as the party was winding down, I jokingly suggested that maybe she should do a karaoke performance to ""give the people what they want."" I thought it would lighten the mood, but instead, Jake took it to heart and started coaxing her to sing. Emily looked even more overwhelmed and started to argue with Jake about it, but he insisted, saying it was all in good fun.

Jake finally backed off when he saw how upset she was, but the damage was done. Emily left the party early, and I could tell she was hurt.

The next day, I reached out to Emily to apologize for my comment. She accepted my apology but expressed how uncomfortable she had felt throughout the evening, especially with the added pressure from both of us. I felt terrible for not supporting her more and for inadvertently adding to her stress.

The plan was for everyone to chip in for the rental cost, groceries, and gas for the trip. We agreed that it would be a shared expense since we all wanted to have fun together.

One of my friends, Sarah (29F), suggested that we also get a few bottles of wine and some snacks for the weekend. I thought it was a great idea and said I’d cover the cost of those items since I was excited to host a fun atmosphere. However, when the time came to split the cabin costs, I realized that the expenses were higher than I expected, and I was feeling a bit stretched financially.

In a moment of panic, I approached the group and suggested that we should all chip in a little more for the cabin rental since I was already covering the wine and snacks. I thought it was a reasonable request, but Sarah got really defensive. She felt that I was being unfair because I had already volunteered to cover the wine and snacks, and she accused me of trying to take advantage of the situation.

Instead of backing down, I ended up snapping and told her that it was her fault for expecting me to just cover everything without acknowledging the extra costs.

Everyone sucks here,"I recently went on a hiking trip with a group of friends. We’ve been planning this for weeks, and everyone was excited. On the first day, one of my friends, Sarah, was lagging behind because she wasn’t feeling well. The group was worried but decided to keep going, thinking she would catch up eventually. I felt bad for her and stayed back to walk with her.

As we walked, I tried to encourage her, but she was really struggling and wanted to turn back. I didn’t want to ruin the trip for everyone else, so I suggested we take breaks instead and keep going. After some convincing, she agreed to continue.

When we finally reached a beautiful viewpoint, I was thrilled, but Sarah was exhausted and a bit grumpy. I snapped a few pictures and posted them on social media with a caption about how amazing the hike was. Meanwhile, Sarah was sitting down, looking miserable.

The next day, I overheard some of our friends talking about how they saw my post and thought I was being insensitive for sharing such happy moments while Sarah was clearly not having a good time. I felt defensive because I thought I was just sharing the experience and didn’t mean to upset anyone. Sarah later confronted me, saying it felt like I was ignoring her struggle for the sake of a good post.

Now I’m feeling conflicted. Maybe I should have been more aware of her feelings, but I also think I was just trying to enjoy our trip. Was I the asshole for prioritizing my experience over hers?",253,1318,0.92,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_80617,2022-02-12 00:00:00,ESH,1467,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"A few months ago, my friend Sarah lost her job and was struggling to make ends meet. She moved in with me temporarily while she looked for a new place. Sarah has a cat named Whiskers, whom she adores. I love animals, but I'm not a huge cat person – I didn’t want one in my apartment long-term, but I figured it was only temporary.

As weeks went by, Sarah seemed to be more focused on her job search and less on managing Whiskers. The cat was often left alone for long hours, and I started feeling bad for him. I bought him toys and tried to engage with him, but he was clearly missing the attention he used to get from Sarah. When I brought it up with her, she brushed it off, saying she was just busy and would make it up to him once she got a job.

One day, I found Whiskers wandering around my neighborhood. He had slipped out of my apartment, and I was worried sick. I decided that it would be best for Whiskers if he could stay with someone more responsible while Sarah figured her life out. So, I called my friend Jenna, who's a huge cat lover, and asked if she could take him in for a while. Jenna was thrilled and immediately came over to pick up Whiskers.

When Sarah found out, she was furious. She accused me of stealing her cat and not caring about her feelings. I argued that I was just trying to do what was best for Whiskers, and that he deserved a home where he would get the attention he needed. Sarah was hurt and felt betrayed because I didn’t even ask her opinion before making the decision.

Now, I feel guilty for taking Whiskers away, but at the same time, I believed I was doing what was best for him. I’ve tried to explain myself to Sarah, but we’ve been at odds ever since. I think we both crossed lines in this situation: I shouldn’t have assumed I could take her cat without discussing it with her, and she should have been more attentive to Whiskers’ needs. 

So, AITA for taking my friend’s cat without her permission to give him to a better caretaker?",606,2172,0.73,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_85974,2021-07-19 00:00:00,ESH,1983,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I recently started a new job at a small marketing firm, and I've been getting to know my coworkers. There's this one guy, let's call him Jake, who seems nice enough but has a habit of making jokes that can be a bit inappropriate. On one occasion, during a team meeting, he made a comment about how ""some people just can't take a joke,"" while looking at me after I had shared an idea. I brushed it off, but it stung a bit.

A couple of weeks later, we were at a team-building event, and he made another joke at my expense that I found really uncomfortable. I was frustrated and decided to confront him about it privately. I told him that his jokes were making me uncomfortable and that I would appreciate it if he could be more considerate.

However, I didn't approach it in the best way. I ended up raising my voice a bit, which made him defensive, and he snapped back that I should ""lighten up"" and that I was being overly sensitive. We ended up in a heated argument, with both of us saying things we later regretted. 

Afterward, I felt bad for how I handled the situation and decided to apologize to him for my tone. He, on the other hand, didn’t apologize for the jokes or for how he reacted. Now there’s this awkward tension between us at work, and I’m wondering if I overreacted or if he was out of line.

Everyone sucks here,"Last weekend, I went to a friend's house for a small gathering. It was a casual dinner party, and I was in a good mood. When I arrived, I noticed that my friend had set up a game of charades for us to play. I love games and was really excited to join in.

During the game, there was this one round where my friend’s younger brother, who is about 12, was struggling to get his team to guess his word. In a moment of enthusiasm, I shouted out a hint that I thought was harmless, but it turned out to be pretty specific and gave away the answer. His team guessed it right away, and I didn’t think much of it.

However, my friend, the host, got upset and said I shouldn’t have done that. I felt a bit defensive and replied that it was just a game and everyone was having fun. I then jokingly said that maybe her brother should have been quicker. My friend got even angrier and told me I was being rude, to which I retorted that maybe she needed to lighten up a little.

After the game, there was a weird tension in the room, and even though I tried to brush it off and enjoy the rest of the evening, I could feel that I had ruined the spirit of the night for her and her brother. In retrospect, I realize I could have been more considerate about the competitive nature of the game, and my friend shouldn’t have snapped at me without considering the context of my actions.

Everyone sucks here,"I (30F) recently had a pretty explosive argument with my brother (28M) that left both of us feeling hurt and angry. The tension has been building for a while because we have different views on family obligations and personal choices.

A few months ago, our parents had a big anniversary party planned, and they were really excited about it. They wanted both me and my brother to be there and to help with the preparations. I had a work commitment that I just couldn’t get out of, and I told my parents I wouldn’t be able to attend. I thought they understood, but my brother did not take it well. He felt I was being selfish and that I should have prioritized family over work.

During a family dinner last week, my brother brought up the anniversary party, and I could tell he was still upset. He started going off about how I never make time for family and how I need to get my priorities straight. I tried to explain my side of things, but he wouldn’t listen. I got frustrated and told him he was being unreasonable and that he didn’t understand what it’s like to have a demanding job.

Things escalated quickly, and we ended up yelling at each other. I called him overly dramatic and said he was looking for reasons to be offended. He threw back that I was a workaholic who only cared about my job and not about our family. It got really heated, and I ended up saying some things I regret about his choices in life and how he hasn’t achieved much compared to his potential.

Afterwards, I felt terrible. I reached out to apologize for my harsh words, but he hasn’t responded. Part of me feels justified in defending my choices, but another part knows I could have handled it better. It’s been awkward since, and I feel like we both messed up.

Everyone sucks here,"I (28M) have been dating my girlfriend (26F) for about two years now, and we’ve been talking about moving in together. I’ve always wanted a pet, and I’ve been thinking about getting a dog for a while. I’m really passionate about it, and I feel like having a dog would make our place feel more like home.

When I brought up the idea to her, she seemed hesitant. She has never owned a pet and is worried about the responsibility and commitment. I assured her that I would take on most of the responsibilities, like walking, feeding, and training. I really believed that once we got the dog, she would come to love it too.

We had a long discussion about it, and eventually, after some convincing, she agreed to get a dog. We decided to adopt a puppy, and I was beyond excited. I went ahead and researched breeds and found one I thought would be perfect for us. The day we brought the puppy home, she seemed overwhelmed but was trying to be supportive.

However, over the next few weeks, she started to express her frustrations more openly. She felt like the dog was taking up too much of her time and attention, and she was stressed by the extra responsibilities. I tried to reassure her, but I also got frustrated. I felt like I had compromised a lot to make this happen, and I didn’t understand why she wasn’t more enthusiastic about it.

One evening, after a particularly long day with the puppy, she snapped at me about how I had pushed her into getting a dog. I was taken aback and told her that she had agreed to it and that I thought it would be good for both of us. I didn’t mean to come off as dismissive, but I was really tired of hearing her complaints when I felt like I was doing all the work.

Things escalated to the point where we were both yelling at each other. I told her she was being unreasonable and she accused me of being selfish for not considering her feelings. Now, we’re in a situation where neither of us is speaking to each other much, and I feel like we’re both at fault. I wanted a dog, but I didn’t want to ignore her feelings either.

Everyone sucks here,"I’ll try to keep this concise.

My best friend, Jenna, has been planning her wedding for over a year, and I’ve been excited to support her throughout the process. A few months ago, she asked me to be her maid of honor, and of course, I said yes. However, things started to get complicated when I realized I would have to travel out of state for the wedding, which would involve a significant expense for me.

I mentioned this to Jenna, hoping to discuss ways to manage the costs. Instead of being understanding, she got defensive and said it was her wedding and I should just be excited to be part of it. I felt really hurt because I was genuinely trying to communicate my concerns.

Fast forward a few weeks, and Jenna has a bridal shower planned. I was excited to help organize it, but when I told her I could only contribute a limited amount of money due to my budget, she snapped at me. She said if I couldn’t contribute more, maybe I shouldn’t be involved at all. I was taken aback but tried to brush it off, telling her I’d still be there to help on the day of the shower.

The day of the shower came, and I arrived with the gifts I could afford. I noticed she surrounded herself with another friend who seemed to be taking over all the planning. When I tried to help with the setup, Jenna barely acknowledged me and directed her attention to this other friend instead.

Feeling sidelined, I finally confronted her about it later that day. I told her I felt unappreciated and like I was being pushed aside. Jenna exploded, saying that planning a wedding is stressful and she couldn’t deal with my negativity on top of everything else. I replied that it was hurtful to treat someone who was supposed to be her closest friend like that.

After that confrontation, I saw another friend of ours, Lisa, who had been helping Jenna, and I vented my frustrations. I may have said some not-so-nice things about Jenna, like how she was being selfish and inconsiderate. The next thing I know, Lisa tells Jenna what I said, and now Jenna is furious with me.

I feel like I was just trying to communicate my boundaries and be involved in a way that I could handle, while Jenna was dismissive of my feelings. Now we’re both upset with each other, and our friendship is really strained.

Everyone sucks here,"A couple of weeks ago, I was at a small gathering at my friend's apartment. It was a laid-back evening with a few people, drinks, and some snacks. At some point, the conversation shifted to relationships and dating stories. 

One of my friends, Lisa, started sharing some hilarious dating fails she's had. We were all laughing and I decided to chime in with a story of my own, but it was a bit more personal. I shared about a time I got ghosted after a really great first date. I thought it was funny looking back, but Lisa responded by saying, ""You probably scared him off with your desperation."" 

I felt a bit taken aback and shot back with, ""Well, at least I was actually trying to date someone. Unlike you, who just flirts with every guy and then complains about being single."" I meant it as a joke, but the atmosphere shifted immediately. 

Lisa looked hurt, and the whole group went tense. She tried to laugh it off, but I could see she was upset. The rest of the night was awkward, and while we all moved on to other topics, I could feel the tension lingering. 

Later, Lisa texted me saying my comment was out of line and that it was hurtful. I replied that I was just joking, but I also acknowledged that maybe my timing was off. 

Now, I feel bad for bringing that up in front of everyone, but I also think she needs to hear when she's being overly flirty and then acting surprised when she’s single.

Once inside, I started joking around and trying to get her to laugh. However, I think I misread the situation; she wasn't really in the mood for jokes. She ended up getting frustrated with me for not taking her feelings seriously, and I shot back that she was being overly sensitive. This just escalated things, and soon we were arguing in front of everyone.

In the heat of the moment, I called her ""dramatic,"" which made her even more upset, and she walked out of the party. I felt bad afterward, realizing I might have pushed too hard to make her feel better instead of just being there for her. I went outside to apologize, but she was gone.

I thought it would be fun and went along with it. As the night progressed, the game got a bit out of hand, and people started getting really competitive.

At one point, Jake decided to up the stakes and challenged me to a bet. He said that if I lost the round, I would have to pay for the next round of drinks. I accepted the challenge, and to my surprise, I ended up losing. I wasn't too thrilled about it, but I agreed to pay for the drinks. 

However, when I went to place the order, I realized that Jake had cheated during the game. I confronted him about it, and instead of admitting to his mistake, he started arguing and said I was just being a sore loser. Frustrated, I called him out in front of everyone, saying that he was being dishonest and ruining the fun. This led to a heated argument, and soon everyone else was getting involved with mixed opinions.

Some friends sided with me, saying that it was unfair for Jake to cheat and that I shouldn’t have to pay for the drinks. Others thought that I was overreacting and should just let it go since it was supposed to be a fun night. Eventually, the tension escalated, and the party ended up breaking up early because of the fight.

In hindsight, I feel like I could have handled the situation better by not calling Jake out so publicly, but at the same time, I think it was wrong for him to cheat and then try to make me look bad.

I’ve been working at this marketing firm for a couple of years now, and there’s a tight-knit group of coworkers I usually hang out with. We like to joke around a lot, and our office has a fairly relaxed vibe. Everyone is pretty open about their lives and relationships, including their ups and downs. 

Recently, a new intern joined our team. She’s young and seems eager to fit in, but she's also quite reserved compared to the rest of us. One day, we were chatting about weekend plans. I mentioned that I was thinking of going to a music festival and how I’d love to find someone to go with. One of my coworkers joked, “Well, maybe you should ask our lovely intern to join you!” Everyone laughed, including the intern, who seemed to appreciate the humor.

Feeling a bit cheeky, I added, “Yeah, I mean, if I can’t find anyone else, I might just have to convince her to come along. I can be very persuasive.” I was grinning when I said it, but immediately I noticed that the intern’s smile faded. She looked uncomfortable, and the laughter in the room shifted to awkward silence. 

After a moment, she shook her head and said, “Wow, that’s really inappropriate,” and then walked away. I didn’t think much of it at first, but later that day, my boss called me into her office. Apparently, the intern had complained about my comment. My boss told me to be more mindful of how my jokes could be interpreted, particularly in the context of our workplace.

Instead of bringing it up like I did, I could have waited for her to notice things herself or tried to have a more calm conversation about my concerns.

He can be really cutting, and while I get that he's going through a tough time, it often feels like he takes it out on our sister.

A couple of weeks ago, we decided to have a movie night at my place. I invited my friends, and we were all excited to watch some classics together. I love hosting, but I also like to keep things organized, so I asked everyone to bring snacks to share.

The night of the movie, everyone arrives, and I notice that one of my friends, Sarah, brought a ton of chips and dip. We’re talking multiple bags of chips and several bowls of dip. When I saw it, I was a bit taken aback but didn’t think much of it. I went ahead and set everything out, but when I asked if anyone wanted to try the other snacks that others brought, Sarah just kept saying, “Oh, don’t worry about those, we’ll just eat my chips.” 

That’s when I started to feel annoyed. I thought it was rude for her to overshadow the contributions of everyone else. So instead of letting it slide, I jokingly said, “Wow, Sarah, did you bring the whole snack aisle with you?” 

Everyone laughed, but I could see Sarah’s expression change. She got defensive and said, “Well, I like chips, okay? They’re good for movie nights.” I shrugged it off, but the atmosphere felt tense after that.

As the night went on, I made a point to encourage others to try the other snacks. I said things like, “C’mon everyone, these brownies are amazing!” or “Don’t forget to try the popcorn!” Sarah kept interrupting with comments like, “Why would you want anything but chips?” 

Eventually, things came to a head when she snapped, “Can’t you just let people enjoy what they brought?” I replied, “I’m just trying to make sure everyone feels included!” 

By the end of the night, no one was really enjoying themselves, and Sarah left feeling upset. Now, I’ve received messages from a couple of other friends saying I was too harsh on her. I feel like I was just trying to lighten the mood and encourage variety, but maybe I overreacted. 

So, are we all being a little petty here? Am I the asshole for calling her out, or was she being inconsiderate? Both?",567,2150,0.69,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_47278,2020-05-18 00:00:00,ESH,2118,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I’m 26 years old and I've been working at a marketing agency for about three years now. Recently, we had a team project that was crucial for our client, and I was assigned to work closely with a colleague, Jake, who has been there about a year. Jake and I have always had a friendly but competitive relationship; we often joke around, but I know he can be a bit sensitive.

A couple of weeks ago, we were tasked with a presentation that had a tight deadline. Jake was struggling with his part, and I noticed he was getting increasingly stressed out. I offered to help him, but he brushed me off, insisting he could handle it on his own. I respected his wishes, but as the deadline approached, I realized he wasn’t going to finish on time, which would reflect poorly on both of us.

On the day before the presentation, I took it upon myself to stay late and complete part of his work, thinking it would help us both. I even modified his slides to make them clearer and more impactful. The next day, when we presented to our client, I didn’t mention my contributions to Jake’s work. The presentation went really well, and our client was impressed.

Afterward, Jake found out what I had done and was absolutely furious. He felt betrayed that I had revised his work without telling him and accused me of undermining him. I tried to explain that I was just trying to help, but he couldn’t see it that way. The situation escalated, and we ended up having a huge argument in front of our team, which made things awkward for everyone.

In the heat of the moment, I said some hurtful things about how he shouldn’t have been so careless with his responsibilities, and he snapped back about me being overly competitive and not a team player. It escalated to the point where our manager had to intervene.

Now, I feel guilty because I genuinely wanted to help him, but I also think Jake should have been more open to collaboration instead of being so prideful. My co-workers seem split; some think I was just being proactive, while others feel I should have communicated better before making changes.

So, AITA for trying to help Jake and ending up causing a huge fallout?",356,2244,0.84,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_89854,2023-10-16 00:00:00,ESH,2160,AITA

I’ve been trying my best to support her, listening to her vent and helping her get back on her feet. Recently, she came to me and expressed that she was feeling lonely and wanted to get out more, so I suggested we plan a weekend trip together to a nearby city. 

I got really excited about the trip and started planning it out, even booking a hotel room. I thought it would be a fun escape for both of us. However, when I told Emily about the plans, she seemed hesitant. She mentioned that she was still feeling down and wasn't sure if she would enjoy the trip. I insisted that it would be good for her to get away and that I was sure she would have a great time once we were there. 

The day before our trip, she texted me saying she wanted to cancel. I was frustrated because I had already paid for the hotel and planned everything out. I told her that she was being overly negative and needed to push herself out of her comfort zone. I ended up persuading her to come, but during the trip, she was clearly not enjoying herself. 

At one point, she snapped at me, saying I was being pushy and not respecting her feelings. I felt hurt because I was just trying to help her. After all, I thought a little push was what she needed to get back on track. 

So, I ended up feeling guilty for insisting she come, but at the same time, I felt she should have been more open to trying to enjoy the trip. We both left the trip feeling upset with each other.

However, I found out that Mark has a history of being pretty manipulative in past relationships. He tends to play the victim and has a knack for getting his way, which made me really uncomfortable.

I didn't want to overstep, but I felt a responsibility as her friend to warn her about what I knew. I brought it up casually the next time we were hanging out, and Jenna got really defensive. She insisted that Mark had changed and that I was being unfair by judging him based on his past. To be honest, I could see her point, but I just couldn’t shake the feeling that I should have said something.

Eventually, I got frustrated and told Jenna that I thought she was being naive. I even said that if she continued to date him, it might affect our friendship. I realize now that that was pretty harsh. Jenna ended up crying and told me I was being controlling and that she felt I was trying to dictate her choices.

One of my friends, Tom, invited his new girlfriend, Sarah, to join us. We were all excited to meet her, but it quickly became apparent that she was not the outdoorsy type.

During our first night around the campfire, Sarah complained about the mosquitoes and the lack of cell service. She kept insisting we should've picked a hotel instead of camping. I tried to lighten the mood by joking around about how part of the charm of camping is dealing with nature. That did not go over well, and she rolled her eyes at me.

The next day, Sarah suggested we spend the day in a nearby town instead of hiking as planned. I was really looking forward to the hike, and I didn’t want to ruin it for everyone, so I said I’d prefer we stick to the original plan. Tom got upset because he wanted to keep Sarah happy, and a bit of tension grew between us.

In the end, we compromised and split up for the day. I felt frustrated because I thought I was just trying to maintain our tradition, while Sarah felt unwelcome and annoyed. When we returned to camp, Sarah was clearly upset and I snapped at her, saying that if she didn’t like camping, she shouldn’t have come. Tom got really angry at me for saying that, and we ended up having a huge argument.

So, I (25F) have a close friend, Sarah (26F), who has been dating Mark (28M) for about a year. Recently, I found out that while Sarah has been with Mark, she has been chatting with another guy, Jake (27M), and they’ve even been flirting pretty heavily. I didn’t confront her about it right away because I wasn’t sure how to approach the topic.

Well, a few days ago, Sarah dropped a bombshell: she and Mark are planning to go on an all-expenses-paid vacation to Hawaii with his family. She’s excited, but she also mentioned she’s feeling a bit guilty about Jake. I couldn’t help but think that this was the perfect opportunity for me to take a vacation too since I’ve been struggling financially and this would cost me nothing. 

So, I made a decision. I told her I would keep quiet about her chats with Jake if she took me with her on the trip. I justified it by thinking that it’s her relationship, and she can do what she wants, but I didn’t want to be the one to ruin her happiness or the vacation.

Now, I feel like I’m in a weird position. On one hand, I want to support her and enjoy the trip, but on the other hand, I know it’s wrong to keep her secret and not tell her that what she’s doing isn’t fair to Mark.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I was recently part of a community theater production, and I was cast as one of the lead roles. I love acting, and I take my performances seriously. We had a pretty tight-knit cast, and most of us got along well, but there was one actor who was new and seemed a bit off. 

During rehearsals, this actor, let’s call him Jake, would often forget his lines or mess up his blocking. It wasn’t just a couple of times—he consistently struggled, which made it hard for the rest of us to perform our scenes. I tried to be supportive and help him out, but he just got defensive and barely took my advice. It ended up being frustrating for everyone.

As we got closer to opening night, tensions were high, and I let my frustration get the better of me. One night after rehearsal, I snapped at him, saying he was ruining the show for everyone and that he needed to step up. I thought I was being honest and direct, but it clearly hurt him, and the next day he didn’t show up to rehearsal.

The director ended up having to talk to me about my outburst and how it affected the cast morale. I felt bad because I didn’t mean to hurt him, but at the same time, I was stressed about the performance and felt like I had a right to express my concerns. 

A few days later, I overheard Jake talking to another cast member, saying how I had bullied him and made him feel unwelcome. That stung, and I confronted him about it, which led to more tension. 

Now, I’m feeling conflicted because I know I shouldn’t have lost my temper, but I also think he needs to take responsibility for his role in the situation. Everyone was feeling the pressure to perform well, and I don’t think I’m entirely in the wrong here.

Everyone sucks here,"So, a little background: I have a close friend from high school, Jake, who has always had a tumultuous relationship with his family. He often finds himself in financial trouble and has relied on me for help over the years. I’ve lent him money multiple times, which he always promises to pay back, but he rarely does.

Recently, Jake reached out and told me he was in a tight spot again, this time because he lost his job and couldn't pay rent. He asked if I could lend him $1,000 to cover his bills until he could get back on his feet. I was hesitant because I felt like I was enabling his behavior, but I also didn’t want to see him homeless. After some back and forth, I agreed to lend him the money but only if he signed a written agreement acknowledging the loan and a repayment plan.

He was surprisingly offended by this and accused me of not trusting him, which made me feel guilty. I tried to explain that it was more about protecting myself than not trusting him, but he just got angrier. Eventually, I ended up withdrawing the offer and told him I wouldn't be able to help after all.

He exploded with anger, calling me a terrible friend and saying I was just as bad as his family for not supporting him. I also felt frustrated and hurt because I was trying to be responsible. In retaliation, I posted a message on social media about needing to set boundaries in friendships, which I know he saw and interpreted as a dig at him. 

Now I feel guilty about how the whole situation escalated and I wonder if I could have handled it better, but I also think he shouldn't have reacted so dramatically.

Our project is to design a sustainable community plan, and we’ve been working together pretty well for most of the semester. There are four of us in the group, and we’ve had some really good discussions and brainstorming sessions, so I felt optimistic about our chances of getting a good grade.

However, one member of our group, let’s call her Sarah, started to disengage around halfway through the project. She missed a couple of our meetings, didn’t contribute much to the group chat, and her ideas seemed half-baked when she did show up. I thought maybe she was just overwhelmed with other classes, so I tried to reach out and encourage her to participate more, but it didn’t seem to help.

As we approached the final weeks, things got worse. Sarah missed the last two meetings, and when we reached out, we got vague replies about being busy. I was frustrated because I felt like I was doing a lot of the work, along with another group member, while the last member was just coasting along.

The day before our final presentation, Sarah sent a message saying she would not be attending because she “wasn’t feeling well” and that we should just incorporate her slides into our presentation. We had some of her slides, but without her input, they didn’t really fit with the flow we had established. So, the two of us who were present ended up scrambling to adjust everything and make it work.

After the presentation, which went decently well despite the chaos, we had to fill out peer evaluations. I was really conflicted about how to rate Sarah. I felt bad for not giving her a decent score because she clearly had some struggles, but at the same time, it felt unfair to give her credit for not contributing. I ended up giving her a 40 out of 100, which I felt was a middle-ground way to acknowledge her lack of participation while also being sympathetic.

When the grades were posted, I found out that Sarah had spoken to the professor about her struggles, and he ended up giving her almost full credit for the project despite her absence and lack of contribution. I felt a wave of anger and frustration wash over me because I had worked so hard and felt like I was being penalized for holding her accountable.

I talked to my other group member about it, and we both felt frustrated. Eventually, we decided to bring it up with the professor, but he told us that he understood Sarah's situation and that he couldn’t change her grade.

On the day of the game night, I got a text from Mark saying he wouldn't be able to bring anything because he forgot to go shopping. I told him it was fine, but I was a bit disappointed because it was supposed to be a group effort. I didn’t want to be that person, but I felt like if we all agreed to contribute, he should have at least tried to bring something.

When everyone arrived, I noticed that Jake had brought way more snacks than anyone else - chips, cookies, and even some homemade dip. Sarah and Emily each brought a few things, but Mark just showed up empty-handed. I tried to lighten the mood and said jokingly, “Hey Mark, you’re on snack duty next time since you forgot this time!” 

Mark laughed it off, but I could tell it bothered him. Later in the night, when we started playing games, I noticed Mark being a bit quieter than usual.

So, I’ve been planning a surprise birthday party for my friend, Sarah, for a couple of months now. I wanted to make it special because she’s always been there for me, and I thought it would be a great way to show her how much I appreciate her. I invited a bunch of her closest friends and even arranged for her favorite cake and decorations.

As the day approached, I got really stressed out. I was juggling work, personal commitments, and trying to finalize everything for the party. I ended up spending a lot of time organizing it, and I might have become a bit controlling about the details. I didn’t want anyone to accidentally spoil the surprise, so I asked everyone to keep it under wraps.

On the day of the party, I was running late, and I panicked. I called Sarah to see if she could help me with some last-minute things, but I lied and said I needed something trivial to throw her off.

Instead of being excited, she burst into tears and told me she just needed some time to process what she was going through and that I should have asked how she was doing before planning all of this.

I accused her of being ungrateful for all the effort I put into the party, and she accused me of being selfish and not caring about her mental state.

Overall, our relationship has been great, but we have had some bumps along the way. One of the ongoing issues has been around our friend groups and how we spend time with them. 

I have a close group of friends that I’ve known for years, and they’re like family to me. My boyfriend has his own friends, but he doesn’t see them as often and tends to rely on me for social activities. I’ve always encouraged him to hang out with his friends, but he often prefers to come with me and my friends. 

A few months back, my friends planned a weekend getaway, and I invited my boyfriend along. He seemed excited about it, but as the weekend approached, he started to express that he wanted to spend more time alone with me, away from my friends. He mentioned he felt overshadowed and that he wanted us to have more ""couple time."" I understood his feelings but also felt it was important to maintain my friendships.

During the getaway, there were moments when he acted withdrawn and sulky when I was engaging with my friends. At one point, I decided to step away from the group to check in on him, but instead of talking, he turned the situation into a mini fight. He accused me of prioritizing my friends over our relationship and said I didn’t care about his feelings. I was frustrated because I felt like I was trying to balance both and he wasn’t being supportive of my friendships.

In the heat of the moment, I snapped back and told him he needed to stop being insecure and just enjoy the time we had together. I thought I was being honest, but I realize now that my words might have come off as insensitive. I also regretted not taking his feelings more seriously in that moment.

I (32F) have a brother (30M) who recently got engaged to his girlfriend (28F). I was really happy for them and immediately started planning a bridal shower to celebrate. I thought it would be a wonderful way to bring both families together and create a special moment for my brother's fiancée, who I really like.

A few weeks into planning, my brother's fiancée mentioned that she had a big family and they often have large gatherings. She suggested that we combine our efforts and throw a joint bridal shower and family reunion. I thought it was a great idea, but I also had my own vision of what I wanted to do for her. So, I agreed to combine them, but I said I wanted to have my own separate event for her as well, just something more intimate with close friends.

When I was sharing my ideas with some friends, my brother overheard and got upset. He thought I was trying to take something special away from his fiancée by planning a ""mini-shower"" that would exclude a lot of her family. I explained that it wouldn’t be exclusive; it was just a different type of celebration. He accused me of being selfish for not considering his fiancée's wishes and for wanting to overshadow the family reunion.

Feeling hurt, I decided to go ahead with the separate gathering anyway, but I kept it small and didn't invite my brother or his fiancée. I figured they'd still have their big event and I just wanted to create a special space for my friends to celebrate with me. My brother found out and is furious with me, saying I was being petty and trying to undermine his fiancée's big day.

Everyone sucks here,"I recently graduated from college, and to celebrate, I decided to throw a small get-together at my apartment. I invited a mix of friends from college and a few people from my hometown. 

One of my college friends, Sarah, has been really close to me over the years. However, she often struggles with her temper and can be quite confrontational, especially when she’s had a few drinks. I was aware of this but thought that if everyone kept things low-key, it would be fine.

I set some ground rules for the night: no drama, keep the noise down since my neighbors are sensitive, and no excessive drinking. The first few hours went well, but as the night progressed, people started getting a bit rowdy. I noticed that Sarah was getting more and more intoxicated, and I worried about her becoming confrontational.

Around midnight, Sarah and another friend, Mike, got into a heated argument over a game. Instead of diffusing the situation, I tried to intervene and keep things light. Unfortunately, my efforts only made things worse, and they both ended up yelling at each other. I could feel the tension in the room rising, and I was embarrassed that my party was turning into a scene.

In a moment of frustration, I raised my voice and told them both to calm down and leave if they couldn’t handle themselves. It was a harsh reaction, and I instantly regretted it. Sarah ended up storming out in tears, while Mike stayed and tried to apologize for the whole situation. I felt bad for how I handled it, but at the same time, I was so stressed about the party going off the rails.

A few days later, Sarah texted me, saying she felt humiliated and that I overreacted. I apologized, but I also mentioned that I didn't appreciate her behavior and that I was just trying to keep the party enjoyable for everyone.

Everyone sucks here,"Title: AITA for getting into a heated argument with my roommate over their cooking?

So, I live in a shared apartment with two roommates. We have a pretty laid-back arrangement, and we all generally respect each other's space. A couple of weeks ago, I decided to host a small dinner party for some friends. I planned to make a nice pasta dish and bought ingredients, including some fancy olive oil and herbs.

The day of the dinner, I realized I had forgotten to buy garlic, which is a staple in my cooking. I noticed that my roommate had a jar of minced garlic, so I borrowed it without asking, thinking it wouldn’t be a big deal since it was just for one night. I figured I’d replace it the next day.

After the dinner, my other roommate came home and noticed the empty jar. They confronted me about it, saying I should have asked first, and that borrowing without permission is disrespectful. I got defensive and argued that it was just garlic and it wasn’t a big deal. We went back and forth, and I ended up saying they were overreacting and needed to chill out.

Things escalated, and we both started raising our voices. At one point, I said something along the lines of, “It's just garlic, not a kidney!” which was definitely an asshole move on my part. My roommate was really hurt by the comment, and I think I might have crossed a line.

After cooling down, I apologized for the comment but still felt like they were blowing things out of proportion. They insist that I should have asked, and now there’s this lingering tension between us. I’m starting to feel guilty about the way I handled the situation, but I also think my roommate could have approached it differently instead of jumping straight to confrontation.

So, AITA for borrowing the garlic and then arguing with my roommate? Should I have just asked first, or were they overreacting?",918,2463,0.65,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_74286,2020-07-07 00:00:00,ESH,1855,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Throwaway account for privacy. I'm (29) in a long-term relationship with my girlfriend (28). We both have our own hobbies that we’re passionate about. I’ve been really into photography for years, and she’s a fantastic painter. Recently, she decided to host a small art show to exhibit her work, which I was really excited about. I offered to help her with the event planning, and we worked hard together to prepare.

As we were getting closer to the show date, I was starting to feel a bit anxious about my own photography. I’ve been working on a series of photos that I thought could fit well in a gallery setting, and I started to contemplate whether I should ask her if I could showcase some of my pieces at her event. I didn’t want to overshadow her, but I thought it could be a nice opportunity to get some exposure for my work, especially since I was helping her with the show.

When I brought it up to her, she got really upset. She said that this was her moment, and she didn’t want my photography to take attention away from her paintings. I understood where she was coming from, but I also felt like I had been supportive enough to deserve a chance to share my art too. We ended up having a pretty heated argument about it, and in the end, I decided to just pull out of the show altogether. 

However, I still felt hurt and like I was being unfairly shut out of something I was excited about. I told her I thought she was being selfish for not considering my feelings and my art, and that I was only trying to share a moment that could have been special for both of us. She accused me of trying to steal her thunder, which made me feel even more frustrated.

Now, I’m left wondering if I overstepped by wanting to share my work at her show, especially since it was her big day. But I also feel like her reaction was too extreme. AITA here?",923,2834,0.68,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_53554,2018-06-26 00:00:00,ESH,1849,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, I've been friends with this guy, Alex, for a few years now. We met in college and quickly became close. He’s a great person, always supportive and funny, but he has this habit of always needing to be the center of attention. 

Recently, we went to a mutual friend's party. I was excited to catch up with everyone there. However, during the party, Alex kept making jokes and dominating every conversation, even when people were clearly trying to include others. It got a bit exhausting, especially since I was looking forward to reconnecting with some friends I hadn’t seen in a while.

At one point, I was trying to talk to another friend, Lisa, about something important happening in her life. Just as I was getting into it, Alex interrupted with a loud joke that completely derailed the conversation. I felt frustrated, and honestly, a little embarrassed that he couldn’t see how rude he was being. 

After a while, I snapped and told him he was being inconsiderate and that it wasn’t all about him. I said something along the lines of, ""Can you let other people talk for once?"" He looked hurt and defensive, saying I was overreacting and that he was just trying to lighten the mood. I didn’t mean to make him feel bad, but I was tired of always having to compete for attention when we were in a group.

The vibe at the party changed a bit after that, and I felt bad for causing tension. Alex has been distant since then, and I regret how I handled it. I thought I was standing up for myself and the others, but maybe I could have approached it differently.

Everyone sucks here,"I work at a small marketing agency with a tight-knit team of five. We’ve been together for a few years, and we have a good rhythm going. Recently, we hired Lisa, who was recommended by our boss. She’s enthusiastic and has a lot of fresh ideas, but she also has a tendency to dominate conversations and dismiss the contributions of others.

At first, I tried to be welcoming and supportive, giving her a chance to express her ideas. However, it quickly became frustrating when she would interrupt us during meetings or talk over us. For example, in one meeting, I was presenting a campaign idea I had been working on for weeks. Just as I was getting to the most important part, Lisa jumped in and started critiquing it without even letting me finish. It felt disrespectful, and I could see my other coworkers were equally annoyed.

As time went on, my patience began to wear thin. I started to push back a bit more during meetings, pointing out when she interrupted and reminding her that we all needed to share the floor. This led to some tense moments, and although I was trying to stand up for myself and my colleagues, I realize now that I might have come off as confrontational. 

One day, during a brainstorming session, I lost my temper a little. I snapped at her and told her that if she wanted to contribute, she needed to stop acting like she was the only one with good ideas. The room fell silent, and I could see Lisa was hurt. After that, the atmosphere in the office became tense; no one wanted to engage with her, and she started isolating herself during lunch.

I felt justified in my reaction, but looking back, I see that both Lisa and I contributed to the situation. She should have been more aware of her behavior, but I also shouldn’t have let my frustration boil over like that. It’s clear that we both mishandled the situation, and now things are uncomfortable at work.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I (30F) have been living with my boyfriend (32M) for about two years now. We both work full-time, and we try to share household chores as evenly as possible. However, I’ve noticed that he often dismisses my contributions to our cleaning routine, which really frustrates me.

To give you context, I have a busy job that sometimes requires me to work long hours, and I also take care of a lot of the cooking and grocery shopping because I enjoy it and I want to make sure we’re eating well. That said, I still think it’s fair that we split chores, so I usually take care of the kitchen while he handles the vacuuming and laundry.

Recently, I’ve been getting increasingly annoyed because, despite me doing the bulk of the cooking and cleaning, he often just leaves things lying around, like his shoes and dirty dishes. I’ve tried to talk to him about it calmly, but he usually brushes it off, saying he’ll get to it later. So, it’s been building up.

One evening, after a long day at work, I came home to find the living room a mess. There were his shoes in the middle of the floor, half-eaten snacks on the coffee table, and dirty dishes stacked in the sink. I lost my temper. I yelled at him about how I felt unappreciated and that I was tired of feeling like the only adult in the house. He got defensive and said I was being overly dramatic, which only made me angrier.

In response, I ended up throwing one of his dirty dishes at the wall (it didn’t break, thankfully) and told him he needed to start pulling his weight around the house. He was shocked and hurt, and we ended up having a huge argument. Afterward, I felt guilty about how I handled it, but part of me still feels justified in my frustration.

I know I shouldn’t have thrown the dish, but I also think he needs to realize that I’m not okay with the way things are. Am I the asshole for how I reacted?",533,1725,0.78,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_20228,2024-10-18 00:00:00,ESH,1872,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I’m posting this from a throwaway because I’m honestly conflicted about what happened and I’m not sure if I’m the asshole here or not.

So, a little background: I live in a small apartment complex where the walls are pretty thin. I’ve got one neighbor, Lisa, who is generally a nice person but has this habit of yelling at her kids pretty frequently. She has two young kids, and while I understand parenting can be tough, it’s often at odd hours, and it gets really disruptive. I work a freelance job, so my hours are all over the place, and I’ve been trying to be patient.

A few weeks ago, I finally snapped when she started yelling at her kids at 6 AM on a Saturday. I had a deadline that I was working on, and I hadn’t slept well the night before. I banged on the wall a few times to let her know it was too early, and I might have shouted, “Can you keep it down?!”

This kind of set off a chain reaction. Lisa came over a bit later, clearly upset, and confronted me about it. I tried to explain that I was having a hard time focusing and that the yelling was too much. We ended up having a heated argument where I may have said some things I didn’t mean, like calling her a “bad parent” for not controlling her kids. I regretted it immediately after, but it was out there.

Things escalated from there. Just a couple of days later, I noticed she had started playing music really loudly during the day, almost like a form of retaliation. It was annoying, but I figured this was her way of coping with the conflict. I didn’t want to escalate things further, but I also couldn’t concentrate with the noise.

One night, around 11 PM, I had finally had enough. I knew she had a party planned for that weekend, so I decided to send her a message through our building’s group chat, calling her out for being disrespectful during the late hours and suggesting she should be more considerate. In hindsight, it was a bit passive-aggressive and not my best move.

She responded angrily, saying I was being unreasonable and that she was just trying to enjoy her life. I felt bad about how things had spiraled but also justified because I felt like I was trying to stand my ground against her noise. It turned into a back-and-forth where I might have crossed the line again, saying that if she couldn’t handle her kids, she shouldn’t have had them in the first place.

Now, I feel guilty about how our relationship has soured. We used to be friendly, and now it feels like there’s this huge wall between us. I can't help but wonder if I’m the asshole for escalating things and being so harsh in my messages, while she was just trying to deal with her kids and have some fun. 

So, am I the asshole here, or is it just a case of everyone being an asshole?",320,2108,0.61,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_91384,2018-09-29 00:00:00,ESH,2746,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Last week, I organized a small get-together at my house for a few close friends. It was a casual gathering, mostly to unwind and catch up after a hectic few months. I invited everyone a week in advance and mentioned that I’d be providing snacks and drinks.

A couple of days before the event, one of my friends, Jake, reached out to ask if he could bring his partner, who I hadn’t met yet. I said that was fine, but I also mentioned that it would be a small gathering, so I was trying to keep it intimate. He assured me they’d just stop by for a little while.

On the day of the get-together, I was busy prepping and setting up everything. When Jake and his partner arrived, I noticed right away that they brought along two more friends of theirs. I felt a bit overwhelmed since I wasn’t prepared for that many people, but I tried to roll with it and enjoy the night.

As the evening went on, I started to feel frustrated because it became clear that Jake had turned our small get-together into a larger party. I overheard him telling our mutual friends that it was a “big bash” and that everyone was welcome to bring whoever they wanted. I didn’t want to create a scene, so I kept my comments to myself and tried to stay pleasant, but I felt my irritation growing.

At one point, I pulled Jake aside and expressed how I felt caught off guard by the extra guests and that I was hoping for a more intimate gathering. He brushed it off, saying it was still a fun night and that I should just relax. I admit that I might have snapped a little and told him that if I wanted a big party, I would have planned one.

Now, I’m feeling guilty about how I handled the situation. I shouldn’t have lost my temper, but I also feel like Jake was inconsiderate for bringing so many extra people without checking with me first.

Recently, Sarah got a new job that she’s really excited about, and I’ve been supportive. However, she’s been really stressed out about her new responsibilities and has been venting to me a lot. I’m usually a good listener, but I’ve been dealing with my own issues at work, where I just found out I might not get a promotion I was hoping for. It’s been tough, and I’ve been feeling pretty down about it.

Last weekend, Sarah invited me to a small get-together to celebrate her new job. I thought it would be a good way to take my mind off things, so I went. During the gathering, Sarah started talking about all the great things at her job and how much she loves it. I was happy for her, but I couldn’t shake off my own frustrations. When she asked how I was doing, I hesitated but decided to share my disappointment about the promotion, thinking she’d be supportive.

Instead, Sarah seemed to brush it off and said, “Well, at least you still have a job; I’m just trying to get through this rough patch.” I felt kind of dismissed, especially since I had just been there for her through her stressful times. I snapped a little and said something like, “It’s easy to say that when you’re in a position of success. Not everyone’s life is perfect, you know?” As soon as I said it, I regretted it. The atmosphere became tense, and Sarah looked hurt.

After that, the night went downhill. We ended up arguing, and I said some things I didn’t mean in the heat of the moment.

I immediately apologized and tried to move past her, but she turned around and started berating me for being inconsiderate, saying I should be more careful. I told her that I was sorry but that the store was really packed and I was just trying to get my shopping done too. She didn’t take it well and insisted that I should have been paying more attention, especially to people who are older.

At that point, I felt a bit defensive, so I mentioned that everyone is shopping and that it’s not just her who has to be cautious. I suggested that maybe standing in the middle of the aisle wasn’t the best idea if she didn’t want to get bumped into. This prompted her to call me rude and argue that I should be more respectful to my elders.

A few months ago, Amy confided in me that she had been struggling with her job and was feeling really overwhelmed. I listened and encouraged her to speak to her boss about her concerns. After a while, she decided to quit her job and pursue a different career path, which I supported wholeheartedly.

However, things took a turn when I started feeling a bit burned out and stressed out at work, too. I began to share my struggles with Amy, but I noticed she seemed less interested in my problems. Instead, she frequently brought up her own issues and would often cut me off when I tried to talk about my challenges. It felt like she didn’t have the bandwidth to support me despite how I had been there for her.

One day, after a particularly rough week, I vented to her in a text about how I felt like I was always the one there to support her but never received that same support back. I might have said something a bit harsh, like ""I guess I should just get used to being your personal therapist."" It wasn’t my best moment, and I regret wording it that way. 

Amy took offense and accused me of being selfish and not respecting what she was going through. Feeling defensive, I shot back that she had been dismissive of my feelings.

I (28M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (27F) for about two years. We both work full-time jobs, but she has a higher-paying job and often works longer hours than I do. When we first started dating, we would take turns cooking and cleaning, but over time, it seemed like I was doing more of the chores while she was focused on her work.

I grew up in a household where chores were split fairly evenly, and I always believed in sharing the load in a relationship. However, I noticed that my girlfriend began to take a more relaxed approach to housework, especially during busy periods at her job. I would come home to a messy apartment while she would be sprawled on the couch, scrolling through her phone or watching TV.

As a result, I started to feel resentful. I began voicing my frustrations about the state of our apartment, and instead of finding a solution together, our conversations often turned into arguments. I admit that I wasn't always tactful; I would sometimes raise my voice when I felt overwhelmed.

I noticed that my son was feeling left out because my partner’s daughter was getting most of the attention since she was the one who’d been thrown into the situation unexpectedly.

Instead of helping out, I ended up trying to keep the peace by entertaining my son and distracting him from the tension. My partner was frustrated because she felt overwhelmed, and I was trying to be a good partner but ended up snapping at her when she complained about the chaos. I told her that I was just as tired and that she needed to manage her daughter better instead of expecting me to carry the load when I was only back for a short time.

Things escalated to the point where we were both raising our voices in front of the kids. After a particularly heated argument, I took my son to his room and tried to calm him down, but I felt guilty for dragging him into our mess. The whole situation left us both feeling drained, and we realized that we hadn’t communicated well about our expectations.

We’ve since talked about it, but I’m not sure who was in the wrong. I feel like I should have been more supportive, but I also think she could have managed the situation better instead of letting her frustration out on me.

Everyone sucks here,"My friend group has been tight-knit for years, and we all know each other’s personalities pretty well. Recently, we decided to plan a weekend trip to the beach. Everyone was on board, except for my friend Jake, who said he couldn’t afford it. We all understood, but I suggested we should pitch in to help him out because he’s always been there for us when we needed support. 

Most of the group agreed, but a few were hesitant, saying it’s not fair to cover someone else's expenses. Still, I felt strongly about helping him, so I organized a little fundraiser with my own money to cover his share. I put together a small barbecue at my place and invited everyone over, saying all donations would go toward Jake’s trip costs. 

At the barbecue, I brought up the trip and how much we all wanted Jake to come with us. I was passionate and maybe a bit too pushy, but I genuinely thought it was a good cause. Jake seemed a little uncomfortable with all the attention, and at one point he said he didn’t want to feel like a charity case, but I dismissed it because I thought he’d appreciate the gesture.

A couple of days later, I noticed Jake was upset and talked to him about it. He confessed that he felt embarrassed by the whole fundraiser and didn’t think it was right for me to pressure our friends into giving money for him. He said it made him feel like he was being pitied. I realized that while my intentions were good, I might have crossed a line by making the fundraising a big deal.

In hindsight, some of my friends also said they felt awkward about the situation and thought I was being a bit too much in pushing the fundraiser. I feel bad for putting Jake in that position, but I also wanted to help a friend who I thought needed it. 

So, am I the asshole for trying to help Jake out, even though it backfired and made him feel uncomfortable?",507,2025,0.59,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_50200,2018-02-12 00:00:00,ESH,1853,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So I’m not really sure how to title this, but here goes.

I recently went on a weekend trip with some friends to a cabin in the woods. We’ve been planning this for months, and everyone was really excited. There were about six of us, and we decided to do a potluck for meals. Everyone was supposed to bring something to share, and I volunteered to handle breakfast for the first morning.

I decided to make a big breakfast spread, including pancakes, eggs, and bacon. I went shopping and spent a good amount of money on ingredients. I even bought some maple syrup and fresh fruit to go with the pancakes. I got up early that morning to start cooking because I wanted everything to be fresh and delicious. 

When everyone woke up, they were excited and gathered around the dining table. I was still cooking in the kitchen, trying to get everything ready. But I noticed that instead of helping or even just chatting with me, a couple of my friends were sitting on their phones, scrolling through social media and not engaging at all. I felt kind of hurt because I was putting in a lot of effort to make this a great meal.

After about an hour of cooking, everything was finally ready, and I brought it out to the table. But when I set everything down, I noticed that one of my friends, Sarah, had brought her own breakfast—a smoothie bowl with all sorts of fancy toppings. She placed it right in the middle of the table and said it was for everyone to share. I felt a bit annoyed because it seemed like she didn’t appreciate the effort I put into the breakfast I made.

When it was time to eat, I was a bit frustrated and maybe a little passive-aggressive. I casually remarked, “Well, I guess we have a breakfast competition going on!” I didn’t mean it to sound rude, but it definitely came off that way. Sarah rolled her eyes and said I was overreacting. The atmosphere turned a bit awkward.

After breakfast, we all went for a hike, and I tried to brush off the tension, but things felt off. Later that evening, Sarah confronted me about how I acted during breakfast. I tried to explain that I was just feeling a bit hurt that no one seemed to care about my cooking, but she accused me of being overly sensitive and not respecting her contributions.

Now I’m left wondering if I was the jerk for not just letting it go and enjoying the time with friends. Everyone else said it was fine and that they understood both perspectives, but I still feel like maybe I should have handled it differently.

Everyone sucks here,"My friend and I have been best friends for years, and we often hang out together. Recently, he started dating someone new, and they’ve been spending a lot of time together. I was happy for him but also felt a bit neglected since I was used to hanging out with him more.

One weekend, he invited me to join him and his girlfriend for a movie night. I was excited but a bit nervous since I hadn’t met her yet. When I got there, the atmosphere was a bit awkward. They were clearly in their own world, and I felt like a third wheel. 

During the movie, I tried to engage in conversation, but my friend kept leaning over to whisper sweet things to his girlfriend, ignoring me. I got frustrated and, during a particularly romantic scene, I blurted out, “Wow, I didn’t know this was a couples’ therapy session!” 

It killed the mood, and my friend shot me a look. His girlfriend looked uncomfortable, and my friend said, “Wow, that was really rude.” I felt bad but also thought they were being a bit too lovey-dovey in front of me. After the movie, I tried to lighten the mood, but it just made things worse. 

Later, I apologized to my friend for what I said, but he told me I needed to respect their relationship and give them space. So, I guess I was in the wrong for what I said, but I felt like they were ignoring me too.

The place was fairly busy, and I was focused on my work when a couple of guys walked in. They were joking loudly and seemed to be having a great time, which was fine until they started to invade my personal space.

One of them bumped into my table while laughing, spilling a bit of my coffee. Instead of just saying sorry, he laughed it off and continued talking with his friend like nothing happened. I was annoyed but didn’t say anything at first. However, after a few minutes, the same guy leaned over and pretended to read my screen, making a comment about my work being “super boring.”

I snapped back and told him to mind his own business and to be more careful, since he had already spilled my drink. He got defensive and started making fun of me for being “too uptight,” which only made me angrier. I told him that maybe if he wasn’t behaving like a child, he wouldn’t have to deal with people being annoyed by him.

At that point, he and his friend decided to leave, but not before he called me a “loser” on the way out. I felt justified in my response, but I also realized I could have handled it better instead of escalating the situation. It turned into a bit of a scene, and I ended up drawing attention from other customers.

Everyone sucks here,"TLDR: I snapped at my sister for not inviting me to her wedding and now I'm feeling guilty for ruining the moment. Was I wrong to express my feelings?

For context, my sister and I have always had a rocky relationship, but I thought we were making progress after a few heart-to-heart talks. I was excited when she announced her engagement, hoping that it signaled a new chapter for us. However, when the invitations went out, I was shocked to find that I hadn’t received one. I tried to brush it off, telling myself it was probably a small wedding with limited guests. But as the date approached, I couldn’t help but feel hurt and excluded.

On the day of her wedding, I decided to go to the venue, thinking I would at least show my support from afar. When I got there, I saw her and her fiancé taking photos and celebrating with their friends and family. I felt a wave of emotions hit me, and before I knew it, I walked up to her and asked why I wasn’t invited. It was supposed to be a joyful day, but I ended up causing a scene. She was taken aback and responded that it was a very intimate gathering and she didn’t want to hurt my feelings by inviting me just to have a “token sister” there.

Her friends and some family were around and I could see that I had ruined the moment. I immediately regretted my outburst, but I felt so hurt and rejected that it just came out. Afterward, I apologized to her, but the damage was done. I could see her disappointment, and it made me feel terrible.

Now, I'm left wondering if I was wrong for confronting her about it, especially on her wedding day. Was I justified in expressing my feelings, or did I cross a line? Should I have just stayed quiet and let her enjoy her day?",949,976,0.7,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_24551,2018-01-25 00:00:00,ESH,1718,AITA

So, here's the deal. I (28M) have a younger sister, Emma (25F), who has been dating this guy, Jake (27M), for about a year now. I'm not a fan of him; he just seems really selfish and constantly talks over her. I’ve tried to be supportive, but I can’t help but feel like she deserves better.

Last week, Emma invited me to a dinner party at her place to celebrate their anniversary. I was nervous about it, but I thought it would be good to spend some time with her. I showed up, and the vibe was okay at first. We had some drinks, and everything seemed fine until Jake started making fun of my job in front of everyone. I felt embarrassed, but I laughed it off to avoid causing a scene.

As the night went on, I got a bit tipsy and decided to confront him about it. I told him that he needs to respect Emma and stop belittling people for their jobs. It turned into a heated argument where I called him out for being a jerk. Emma tried to intervene, but I was worked up and wasn’t backing down. In the end, I ended up storming out, and I think I may have said some things that I shouldn’t have.

Afterward, Emma called me, really upset, saying that I embarrassed her in front of Jake and their friends. I feel bad for making her uncomfortable, but I also think I was standing up for her. I reached out to her the next day to apologize for how I handled it, but she still seems really angry.

So, I guess my question is—am I the asshole for trying to defend my sister, or was I out of line for confronting Jake at her party? I honestly feel like we all acted pretty poorly. ESH?",93,2757,0.76,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_58207,2019-04-02 00:00:00,ESH,1662,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I've been best friends with Mark for over a decade. He's a great guy, but he has this habit of being incredibly stubborn about... well, everything. Lately, he's been trying to get into cooking and insists on making every meal at his place from scratch. The problem? He’s not very good at it. 

Last week, he invited me over for dinner, and I was excited. However, when I got there, the smell was overwhelming. He had burnt the chicken and the kitchen was a disaster. I tried to be supportive but the smoke alarm was going off and the food was inedible. 

Instead of admitting he messed up, he insisted that it was ""a culinary experiment"" and wanted to serve it anyway, claiming it was ""still perfectly fine."" I told him that it really wasn’t, and suggested we order pizza instead. He got defensive and accused me of not appreciating his efforts. I felt bad, but honestly, I couldn’t eat that food without getting sick.

In the heat of the moment, I kind of snapped and said, “If you want to keep experimenting, at least learn to cook something that doesn’t set off the smoke alarm.” He was hurt and we ended up arguing, which made everything awkward. 

Now, I feel guilty for being so blunt and hurting his feelings, but I also think he needs to hear the truth about his cooking. He does this with other things too – never takes constructive criticism well, and it frustrates me because I care about him and want him to improve.

Everyone sucks here,"So, this happened a few weeks ago, and I’m still trying to wrap my head around it. I was at a friend’s birthday party, and it was a pretty big gathering with lots of people. We were all having a good time, and as the night went on, the drinks started flowing a little too freely.

At one point, I noticed that my friend, who was the birthday girl, was sitting by herself looking a bit down. I figured I’d cheer her up, so I went over to her and started asking about her day and her plans for the year. However, I might have come on a bit too strong because I was pretty tipsy. I kept talking and didn’t really notice that she wasn’t really responding or engaging much.

Eventually, she flat-out told me that she just wanted some space, and that I was being a bit overwhelming. I got defensive and said something like, “Well, I’m just trying to be a good friend and help you!” This led to a small argument where I insisted I was just trying to support her, but she said I was making her feel worse by not respecting her boundaries. 

The whole thing blew up a bit, and a few other friends chimed in, saying I should have listened to her instead of pushing my help on her. I felt really bad afterward and ended up leaving the party early.

Everyone sucks here,"TL;DR: My brother's girlfriend and I had a falling out over her pregnancy announcement, and things have been awkward ever since. I’ve been ignoring her, and my brother thinks I should apologize.

My brother ""Ethan"" and I have always been close. We share a lot of interests and often hang out together. Recently, he started dating ""Samantha."" I’ve met her a few times, and while she seems nice, I’ve noticed that she can be a bit self-centered. 

A few months into their relationship, Samantha announced that she was pregnant. Ethan was over the moon, but I wasn't as enthusiastic. We had all planned a family trip, and I was looking forward to spending quality time with Ethan. Instead, Samantha's announcement overshadowed everything. I felt like the focus shifted to her pregnancy, and I wouldn’t get to have my brother to myself like I used to.

At a family dinner to celebrate the news, I made a joke about how I was going to be “the fun aunt” and that I hoped they wouldn’t be too boring with their parenting. Samantha didn’t take it well. She snapped back about how being a parent was serious business, and that I shouldn’t undermine their excitement. I was taken aback and tried to laugh it off, but I could tell I hurt her feelings.

After that dinner, I found myself avoiding Samantha. I didn’t want to deal with the tension, so I started to distance myself from both her and Ethan. I wouldn’t respond to her texts, and I didn’t want to hang out with them when they invited me. I figured it was better to keep the peace by not being around. 

Ethan eventually confronted me about it, saying I was being rude and should apologize to Samantha. He said he understood my feelings but that I was overreacting and it was her time to shine. I didn’t think I owed her an apology for being honest, but I also could see how my behavior might be hurting her and my brother.

Things have become really awkward at family gatherings. Ethan is caught in the middle, trying to keep things light, while I feel resentful that my brother is siding with her. I’ve been questioning whether I should just apologize and try to mend things, but I still feel justified in how I reacted, given the circumstances.

Overall, it’s been a pretty harmonious living situation.

Recently, my roommate Julia started dating this guy, Jake. At first, we were all okay with him coming over occasionally, but it quickly escalated to him being at our place almost every day and sometimes staying overnight. I felt uncomfortable because Julia didn't really communicate this change with the rest of us, and it was starting to feel like we didn’t have a say in who was in our shared space.

I decided it was time to talk to Julia. I approached her and explained that while I was fine with her dating, having Jake over so often was making me uncomfortable, especially since he wasn’t officially part of our living agreement. I asked if they could maybe tone it down a bit.

Julia became defensive and said I was being unreasonable. She accused me of trying to control her life and said she felt like I didn’t want her to be happy. I was frustrated and tried to explain that my concern was mostly about the lack of communication and the sudden change in our living situation, but she wasn’t having it.

We’ve been friends for over a decade and I’ve always tried to support her during tough times. Recently, Jenna has been going through a particularly rough patch, and I’ve been there for her—listening, encouraging her to see a therapist, and checking in often.

A couple of weeks ago, I had a big promotion at work that I was really proud of and excited about. I wanted to celebrate and thought it would be a nice idea to host a small get-together with a few close friends, including Jenna. When I invited her, she seemed a bit distant and didn’t respond enthusiastically. I figured she was just feeling low, so I reassured her that it would be a low-key event and that she was welcome to bring along her boyfriend for support.

The night of the celebration, Jenna came but was very quiet and withdrawn. I tried to engage her in conversation, but she mostly sat on the side, scrolling on her phone. After a while, I noticed she seemed upset and I tried to talk to her. She finally opened up about how she felt overwhelmed by everything happening in her life, and seeing me celebrate my success made her feel inadequate. I felt awful and tried to reassure her that everyone has their own journey and it’s okay to feel this way. 

However, while I was trying to help her feel better, I also wanted to share my excitement with my other friends. At one point, I raised a toast to my promotion and thanked everyone for their support. Jenna looked visibly upset and left the room, saying she couldn’t handle it. A couple of my friends followed her to check on her, and it felt awkward to just continue the celebration without her.

I replied that I never intended to hurt her and that I thought it was okay to celebrate personal achievements. I told her that I’m always there for her, but I also deserve to share my happiness with my friends.

I felt really excluded and upset, and when they finally came back down, I snapped at Jess and told her that I felt like she didn’t care about how I was feeling during the hike, and that it was unfair for her to force me into activities I clearly wasn’t comfortable with.

She got defensive, saying I was being negative and ruining the vibe of the trip. I ended up raising my voice, and we had a pretty intense argument in front of our friends, who didn’t know how to react. The whole situation put a damper on the trip, and now I feel bad for how I handled it, but I also feel like I wasn’t heard. 

I guess I get why she was upset, but in the heat of the moment, I just couldn't take it anymore. So, AITA for blowing up at her during our trip? 

TL;DR: My girlfriend planned a challenging hike for our group trip, I felt unprepared and excluded, and after a tough time, I snapped at her. Now everyone’s mad at me, and I’m questioning if I overreacted.",616,2013,0.69,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_46340,2023-11-13 00:00:00,ESH,2035,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I have been dating for about a year, and overall, things are pretty good. However, we’ve had some issues lately regarding our communication styles. I’m more expressive and like to share my feelings, while she tends to keep things bottled up and rarely opens up about what’s bothering her.

Last weekend, we were at a gathering with some friends, and I noticed she was acting a bit distant. When I asked her if everything was okay, she just shrugged and said she was fine. I could tell something was off, but I didn't push it because I didn't want to make her uncomfortable.

Later that evening, our friends started talking about their relationships, and I mentioned how important it is for us to communicate openly about our feelings. I didn’t mean to call her out, but I wanted to share my perspective. She got really quiet and then said, “Well, maybe you should just let me handle my feelings my way.” I was taken aback and felt like she was dismissing my attempt to be supportive.

In response, I said something along the lines of, “If you just communicated better, we wouldn’t be having this issue.” I didn't think it was that harsh, but she ended up leaving the conversation and going outside, visibly upset. 

I feel like I was trying to express my concerns, but I also realize that I might have put her on the spot in front of our friends. She later told me that I embarrassed her and that I always seem to make her feel like she’s not doing enough in our relationship. I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings, but I also feel frustrated that she won’t open up to me.

Now I’m questioning whether I handled it poorly or if she was being unreasonable. I guess I feel confused about our communication styles, and I could have approached it better. I can see both sides, but it feels like we’re both at fault here. What do you think?",725,2350,0.97,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_57833,2021-09-23 00:00:00,ESH,1847,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I’m using a throwaway account for this. So, I work in a small marketing firm with a close-knit team. We have a pretty casual work environment, and we often hang out after work to unwind. Recently, we decided to have a team-building retreat at a rented cabin for the weekend to strengthen our bond and get some work done in a relaxed setting.

Before the retreat, our boss made it clear that while we were there to bond and have a good time, we also needed to maintain professionalism and not let loose too much, especially since we had a major client project coming up that required our focus. Everyone agreed, and we all seemed excited about the weekend.

Fast forward to the retreat, and it’s going great—lots of games, laughter, and even some productive brainstorming sessions. However, on the second night, someone suggested a themed costume party. I thought it sounded like fun, but I raised a concern about how it could come off unprofessional, given our boss's earlier warnings.

Most of my colleagues dismissed me, saying we were just having fun and that the boss would be fine with it. I ended up being a bit of a buzzkill and reluctantly agreed to join in, but I chose a less revealing costume to keep it low-key. When I showed up, I was shocked to see my co-workers dressed in overly provocative outfits, completely devoid of the professionalism our boss had emphasized.

As the night progressed, the atmosphere got a bit wild, which made me uncomfortable. I tried to keep it together, but when I noticed our boss’s face during a video call he unexpectedly joined, I felt mortified. He looked disappointed, and I could see him trying hard not to react negatively. 

Afterward, I confronted my colleagues about their costumes and how they might have crossed a line. They argued that I was being uptight and ruining the fun. I felt justified but also realized that I might have come off as judgmental. We ended up having a heated discussion where everyone was pointing fingers, and it left a bad taste in my mouth.

In the end, I felt bad for calling them out, but I also think some responsibility lies with them for ignoring our boss's guidelines. It was a mess, and I’m not sure if I handled it the best way. So, am I the asshole for trying to uphold professionalism while my co-workers just wanted to have fun?",138,999,0.59,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_14301,2018-11-04 00:00:00,ESH,2322,AITA

Recently, he made a series of jokes about my weight. I've always been a bit heavier, and I try to maintain a positive attitude about it, but his comments really struck a nerve.

One night, we were hanging out with some friends, and Jake made a comment about how I should be careful not to ""eat the whole pizza."" I laughed it off at first, but it kept bothering me. Later, I confronted him privately and said, “Jake, you really need to stop making jokes about my weight. They’re hurtful, and I don’t find them funny.”

Instead of apologizing, he just shrugged it off and said, “I’m just joking, lighten up!” I snapped and said, “Maybe you should stop being a jerk and learn to be a better friend!” 

Our argument escalated, and I ended up calling him insensitive and immature. He retaliated by bringing up some of my own past mistakes and saying I was being dramatic. We both ended up saying hurtful things, and it left a divide in our friend group.

***My partner - Sarah***  

I (37M) have been with Sarah (35F) for about five years, and we have a son named Jake (10). Sarah and I share a pretty solid relationship, but there have been some bumps along the way, especially concerning parenting styles.

Recently, Sarah and I had a disagreement about Jake's screen time. She thinks we should have stricter limits, especially since he has been getting a bit obsessed with video games. I, on the other hand, believe that since he's doing well in school and completing his chores, he should be allowed some flexibility. We decided to compromise, but I still let Jake play on the weekends for a few extra hours. 

Last Saturday, after a long week, I decided to let Jake stay up a little later to finish a game he was excited about. When Sarah found out, she was furious. She confronted me in front of Jake, and it turned into a heated argument. I told her she was being too controlling and that a little extra screen time wouldn’t ruin him. She accused me of undermining her authority as a parent and making it harder for us to work together.

Jake was in the room during the argument, and I didn’t think much of it at the time, but afterward, he told me that he felt torn between us and didn't want to be the reason for our fights. I realized that my decision to push back on Sarah in front of Jake might have caused him stress, and that upset me. 

Now, Sarah thinks that I was an AH for creating that tension and for not respecting her parenting wishes. I think she overreacted and that I was just trying to make a fun weekend for our son. I’m planning to have a talk with Jake about how he feels, but I’m also not ready to completely back down on my stance about screen time.

The other day, I was preparing dinner after a long day at work, and I noticed my roommate's dirty dishes piled up in the sink. I asked them to please wash their dishes before I started cooking, as I had limited counter space and needed to use the sink to rinse my vegetables. They snapped back, saying that they were busy and would get to it later, and that I shouldn't act like I owned the kitchen.

I got frustrated and pointed out that I always clean up after myself and that it wasn't fair for me to have to work around their mess. I even mentioned that I had to clean up their spilled sauce from the counter the other day, which they brushed off. We ended up exchanging some harsh words, and I might have raised my voice in frustration.

Here’s the timeline of events that led to the current situation:

- We moved in together about three months ago. In our previous living situations, we had our own routines, but now we have to adjust to sharing everything.
- I work long hours, often bringing work home, and my partner works a standard 9-to-5. 
- At first, I was really trying to contribute to the household, but I found myself overwhelmed with work and often too exhausted to help out with chores during the week.
- My partner has been trying to keep the house clean and cook dinner most nights, which I really appreciate. However, I started to notice that they were getting increasingly stressed and resentful about doing everything while I was busy.
- One day, after a particularly long week, I came home and plopped down on the couch to unwind. My partner confronted me, saying they felt like they were doing all the work and needed my help more. Instead of listening and being understanding, I got defensive and said something along the lines of, ""I work harder than you do, so I deserve to relax when I get home.""
- This led to a huge argument, and I said some hurtful things about how I felt like they weren’t being supportive of my career. They retaliated by saying I was being selfish and not caring about the household.
- We both ended the night feeling angry and upset, and it’s been tense ever since. I realize now that I didn’t appreciate how much effort they were putting in while I was buried in work.

Now, I feel bad about how I reacted, but I also feel like my partner could have approached the situation differently instead of letting resentment build up. We’re both stressed and trying to figure out how to manage our lives better.

At first, I tried to be patient and discuss our cleaning routines, but it quickly turned into arguments.

I admit, I could have chosen my words better, but I was just overwhelmed. 

In response, my partner yelled back that I was being controlling and that they felt like they were walking on eggshells around me. They said they felt unappreciated for the little things they do, like cooking dinner even if the kitchen was messy afterward.

I thought she might be overreacting, but I tried to reassure her that family was important to me, but I also loved her and wanted to build a life together.

I’m hoping to get some feedback on a situation that happened recently. 

So, I (30M) was at a bar with some friends a couple of weekends ago. We were having a great time when a guy at the bar (probably in his late 20s) started playing really loud music on his phone without headphones. It was pretty obnoxious, and a lot of people around were visibly annoyed. I have a bit of a sensitive personality when it comes to noise, and I mentioned to my friends that it was bothering me.

After a while, I couldn’t take it anymore, so I got up and approached the guy. I politely asked him if he could turn it down. Instead of being understanding, he laughed and turned it up even louder, which really frustrated me. In the heat of the moment, I grabbed his phone and turned it off, thinking it would put an end to the noise. 

The guy got furious and started yelling at me, and soon it turned into a bit of a scene. My friends tried to pull me away, but I was feeling pretty justified in my actions. I mean, I was just asking for a little respect in a shared space, right? 

I later realized that maybe I had overreacted and could have handled the situation differently. So I’m wondering, AITA for shutting off his music, or was he just being a jerk?

After a couple of weeks of tension regarding the dog, I started to feel frustrated. I felt like I was being judged for wanting a pet, which was something I had longed for.

After that night, Jake was really upset with me. He told me I needed to respect his relationship and that he didn’t want to hang out if I was going to act like that. I tried to apologize, but it felt like he was still holding a grudge. I ended up talking to Sarah privately and apologized to her too, but it was clear that I had made a mess of things.

Now, I feel like I’ve lost both of them as friends. I understand that my jealousy led me to act poorly, but at the same time, I think Jake could have communicated better about how I was feeling neglected.

Everyone sucks here,"I'm a first-time poster on this subreddit and I really need some perspective on my situation.

So, here's the backstory. I (28F) have a younger brother (24M) who has always been a bit of a troublemaker. He's had issues with substance abuse for the past few years, and our parents have been really worried about him. They've done a lot to try to help him, but he tends to push them away. I’ve always tried to be supportive, but it’s been exhausting.

Recently, he hit rock bottom and ended up in rehab after a really rough incident. While he was away, I felt a lot of mixed emotions. I was glad he was getting help but also frustrated that he continually made bad choices. I was kind of fed up with the way he put our parents through hell, so I ended up venting to some friends about it. I said things like, “I’m done helping him,” and “I can’t believe my parents keep enabling him.”

When my brother got out of rehab, he called me and wanted to meet up. I was nervous but agreed to it, hoping for a constructive conversation. However, during our meeting, he brought up the things I said to my friends. He told me he felt betrayed and hurt that I would talk about him behind his back like that. I tried to explain that I was just venting and that I do care about him, but he was visibly upset and started tearing up, saying it felt like I was abandoning him when he needed support.

In the heat of the moment, I snapped and said, ""Maybe if you weren’t always messing up, I wouldn’t feel the need to vent!"" I instantly regretted it, and he stormed off. I reached out later to apologize, but he hasn’t responded.

So, now I’m questioning if I overreacted and whether I’m the asshole for venting. I feel like I was just being honest in a tough situation, but I also hurt my brother when he’s trying to recover. My parents have also told me to be more understanding, so now I feel guilty too.

AITA for venting about my brother's struggles and then snapping at him when he confronted me? 

TL;DR: I vented about my brother's substance abuse to friends, he found out and confronted me, I snapped at him, and now he’s upset. ESH?",266,1645,0.56,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_65726,2021-04-04 00:00:00,ESH,2122,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I (30M) recently had a falling out with my sister (28F) over her wedding plans. We’ve always been close, but things took a turn when she got engaged six months ago. She asked me to be her best man, which I was thrilled about. However, as planning progressed, I started noticing some pretty big red flags in her choices.

First, she decided to have a destination wedding in a location that is quite expensive for many of our family members to attend. I expressed my concerns about the costs and how it might affect our relatives, particularly our parents, who are on a tight budget. She brushed me off, saying it was her day and she wanted it to be special. I understood that, but I felt she was being pretty inconsiderate toward those who may not be able to make it.

As the planning continued, she told me she wanted to have a very unconventional ceremony that involved some rituals from a culture that she had no personal ties to. I found that pretty problematic and told her it felt disrespectful to appropriate something that wasn’t hers. She got defensive and accused me of trying to ruin her wedding and not being supportive.

Things escalated, and during one of our arguments, I said that if she went through with the destination wedding and the inappropriate rituals, I wasn’t sure I could stand by her side on her big day. That statement really hurt her, and it felt like a line had been crossed. She called me an asshole for not supporting her dreams and told me I was being controlling.

Now, I'm feeling really conflicted. I know I probably shouldn't have threatened to withdraw my support, but I genuinely believe she’s making some mistakes that could hurt her and our family. She hasn’t talked to me since, and I feel terrible about how everything unfolded. I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for being so critical of her choices.

Everyone sucks here,"I'm a 30-year-old woman and I have a younger brother, Jake, who is 25. Our parents always favored him, and I often felt overlooked growing up. He was the golden child, excelling at sports and academics while I struggled to find my own path. Fast forward to now, and Jake is engaged to his college sweetheart while I'm still single and figuring things out.

Recently, Jake invited the family over for a dinner to celebrate his engagement. I was happy for him but also felt a twinge of jealousy, especially since our parents were gushing over everything he has achieved. During dinner, the conversation kept circling back to Jake and his future, completely sidelining my own accomplishments, which felt frustrating.

At one point, out of frustration, I made a snarky comment about how not everyone can coast through life on looks and charm like he does. It was a low blow, and I immediately regretted it as the mood shifted. My parents looked shocked, and Jake got visibly upset. He called me out for being bitter and ruining what was supposed to be a happy occasion.

After dinner, I tried to apologize, but Jake was really hurt, and I could tell my parents were disappointed in me too. They all think I’m just jealous and bitter about my own life, which I kind of am, but I didn’t mean to take it out on him.

Now, I feel like I’ve messed up our family dynamic even more, and I’m not sure if I was completely in the wrong for feeling the way I did or if Jake was being overly sensitive. Am I the asshole here?",887,569,0.86,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_96331,2021-01-09 00:00:00,ESH,1509,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Throwaway account. I work at a community center that offers various programs, including a popular after-school program for kids. Recently, we started a new policy to improve safety by requiring all parents to sign their children in and out of the program. This was implemented after a few incidents where kids were picked up by unauthorized adults or were left waiting outside for too long.

However, some parents have been really resistant to this change. They argue that it’s inconvenient and that they should be able to just drop off and pick up their kids without the hassle. I understand their frustration, but safety is our top priority.

Last week, during our weekly parent meeting, I tried to explain the reasoning behind the policy again. Instead of listening, a group of parents started arguing with me, calling the policy “ridiculous” and “overbearing.” In the heat of the moment, I snapped back, saying that if they were so concerned about their own convenience over their children's safety, maybe they shouldn’t have kids in the program at all.

Things got heated, and some parents walked out, saying they would pull their kids from the program. I felt justified in my frustration, but now I’m wondering if I might’ve gone too far. My coworkers think I shouldn’t have lost my temper, and some parents have been saying I’m the problem. It’s a tough situation because I genuinely believe in the policy's importance, but I also regret how I handled the confrontation.

Everyone sucks here,"Some context: I (26F) recently moved into a new apartment complex and have been trying to get to know my neighbors. I’m quite social and often invite people to hang out, but I also respect people's boundaries. 

Last week, I invited my neighbor, Jake (30M), to join me for a movie night. He initially seemed interested but then declined, saying he was busy. I thought nothing of it and just went ahead with my plans. 

The next day, I saw Jake in the hallway and casually asked him about his evening. He seemed a bit irritated and mentioned that he had actually planned to relax at home and was put off by my invitation because he felt like I was being too pushy. Instead of apologizing, I got defensive and told him that I was just trying to be friendly and that he could have been more straightforward if he wasn’t interested. 

He ended up getting really frustrated with me, saying that he didn’t appreciate my tone and that it felt like I was making a big deal out of him not wanting to hang out. I could tell that our conversation was escalating, and I snapped back, saying maybe he was overreacting and that I didn’t mean any harm by it. 

After that, we both just kind of walked away from each other in the hallway, clearly annoyed. I later realized that maybe I should have respected his boundaries more and not pushed for a movie night when he declined.

Everyone sucks here,"So I live in a small apartment with two roommates, Alex and Jordan. We’ve been living together for about a year, and while we generally get along, there have been a few bumps in the road. 

Alex is really into cooking, which is great because I love having good food around, but they often take over the kitchen without checking in with the rest of us. I usually cook once a week and have a specific day for it. I always let them know when I'm going to use the kitchen, and they’ve agreed to that schedule. However, Alex has a habit of deciding to cook something elaborate on my designated day without asking me first. This frustratingly leads to me having to wait hours to cook or, on some occasions, changing my plans altogether.

Jordan, on the other hand, is a neat freak. I mean, they keep the common areas spotless, which I appreciate, but they can be a bit overbearing about it. If I leave a dish in the sink for more than a couple of hours, Jordan will wash it and leave a passive-aggressive note saying, “Clean up after yourself!” I’ve tried to be better about it, but sometimes life gets busy, and I forget. 

One day, I planned to cook a nice dinner for myself after a long week, and I told Alex about it earlier in the week. But they decided to whip up a last-minute recipe on the same night. I was really annoyed because I felt like my plans were disregarded again. I snapped and said something like, “Can you not see I need this space tonight? It’s always about your cooking!” 

Alex got defensive, and we started arguing, and in the heat of the moment, I said some things I didn’t mean. Meanwhile, Jordan was cleaning up the mess we made while arguing and got fed up with both of us. They told us to grow up and find a better way to handle our issues instead of acting like children. 

Afterward, I felt guilty for how I handled it. I shouldn’t have lashed out at Alex, but I also think they overstepped my boundaries with the kitchen. Jordan, while trying to keep the peace, didn’t really help either. So now I’m left feeling bad about the whole situation, and I’m not sure who was more in the wrong here.

Everyone sucks here,"Okay, so last weekend I was at a local park for a picnic with my partner. We found a nice spot under a big tree, laid out our blanket, and started to enjoy our food. Just as we were getting comfortable, a family came over with a bunch of kids. They approached us and said, “Hey, we always sit here!” 

I thought it was a bit strange, but I politely responded, “Oh, I’m sorry, but we got here first. We’d like to stay here.” The kids started to whine and one of them even sat down on our blanket, insisting that it was their spot. The parents, instead of addressing their kids, started arguing with us about how they’ve been coming to this park for years and that it was their tradition to sit under that tree.

Feeling frustrated, I stood my ground and said we weren’t moving. My partner tried to diffuse the situation by suggesting we could share the space or maybe the family could find another spot, but they were having none of it. The kids were getting louder, and the parents started yelling at us, calling us inconsiderate and selfish. 

Eventually, a few other park-goers started to look over, and one person even suggested we talk to a park ranger about it. I felt embarrassed and a bit overwhelmed. After a tense few minutes, the family finally left in a huff, but not before the dad told us we should be ashamed of ourselves.

My partner said we might have overreacted by not just moving to another spot, especially since it was just a picnic, but I felt like we had a right to stay where we were.

Everyone sucks here,"Last weekend, my partner and I were supposed to go to a concert together. It was a big deal for us since we hadn’t had a proper date night in ages. I had been looking forward to it all week. On the day of the concert, I spent the afternoon getting ready and was really excited. 

A couple of hours before the concert, my partner tells me he’s feeling a bit under the weather and isn’t sure if he can make it. I offer to help him feel better, but he insists that he’s just tired and might need to rest. Part of me is understanding, but I can’t help feeling disappointed. He’s been stressed at work lately, and I know he has a tendency to overcommit himself, so this didn’t completely surprise me.

As the concert time gets closer, I ask him again if he’s sure he wants to skip it. He says he hates to miss out, but he really isn’t feeling it. I decide to go myself because I didn’t want to miss the opportunity. I text a friend who lives nearby, and she agrees to join me last minute.

At the concert, I’m having a great time, but I can’t shake the guilt of leaving my partner behind. I text him a few times to check in and share some photos, and I can tell he’s not thrilled. He responds with short messages and seems a bit irritated. I try to brush it off because I’m enjoying the night, but I still feel bad.

When I get home, he’s waiting up for me. I can tell he’s upset. He tells me that he felt abandoned and that I should have stayed home with him. I try to explain that I didn’t want to miss out on something we were both excited about, and I thought it was okay to go without him, but that just seems to make him angrier. 

In the heat of the moment, I tell him he should have communicated better instead of just shutting down and deciding not to go. He counters that I should have respected his need for rest and not gone without him. We end up arguing, and things get pretty heated.

Looking back, I realize we both could have handled the situation better. I should have been more sensitive to how he was feeling, and he could have been more open about his feelings instead of just saying he was tired. We both ended up having a rough night, and now I feel guilty for going out while he stayed home feeling miserable.

Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I (both in our early 30s) have been together for six years and recently got engaged. We're both very career-driven and have always supported each other's ambitions, but lately, things have gotten complicated. I work in a demanding job that often requires long hours and occasional travel, while my partner has a more stable but less exciting position at a local company.

A few months ago, my partner was offered a promotion that involved a significant pay raise and a chance to lead a new project. However, the promotion requires her to relocate to a different city, which is about a four-hour drive away. At first, she was excited about the opportunity, but I expressed my concerns. I worried about how the distance would affect our relationship and how I would manage my job alongside supporting her in a new city. I suggested that we could look for a compromise, like her working from our current city or finding a less demanding position nearby, but she felt that I was undermining her career.

Things escalated when I proposed that we both take a step back and evaluate our career goals together, but my partner interpreted this as me not believing in her abilities. She accused me of holding her back and not being supportive. In a moment of frustration, I admitted that I was worried about the potential distance affecting our relationship and how our lives might change, which only fueled her anger.

In retaliation, she began to distance herself emotionally, spending more time with friends and less time with me. She also started making comments about how I was selfish for not wanting her to pursue this opportunity, which hurt. I tried to communicate openly, but our discussions often ended in arguments. 

Recently, we had a big blowout where we both said hurtful things. She accused me of being jealous of her success, while I accused her of being dismissive of my feelings. It ended with her saying she needed time apart to think, which left me feeling confused and hurt.

Now I’m wondering if I was wrong for expressing my concerns about her promotion and the potential impact on our relationship. Should I have just been more supportive of her decision, despite my worries? Or are my feelings valid too? So, am I the asshole for trying to protect our relationship, or are we both just messing this up?",752,1631,0.78,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_27202,2019-05-18 00:00:00,ESH,2334,AITA

However, the party was going to be pretty large, and she mentioned that she wanted people to contribute to the food and drinks. I thought it was a little odd for an engagement party, but I agreed to bring a few appetizers.

As the date approached, I found out that Laura was planning to have a professional catering service for the main courses and drinks. It felt like a bit of a contradiction to be asking guests to bring food while also hiring caterers, but I figured it wasn’t my place to judge.

Jake confronted me about it, and I told him that if he didn’t want to include everyone, then he shouldn’t expect to keep everyone loyal to him.

Everyone sucks here,"Title: AITA for wanting to stop supporting my friend financially but also needing to set boundaries?

I (27F) have a close friend, ""Sarah"" (28F), who has been struggling financially for the past couple of years. She lost her job during the pandemic and has had a hard time finding stable work since. I’ve been helping her out by covering her rent and some of her bills because I have a decent job that pays well. I thought I was being a good friend by supporting her during this tough time, but it’s starting to take a toll on me.

It started as a temporary arrangement, but over the last year, I’ve been paying her rent and utilities almost every month. I’ve had to dip into my savings to keep up with it because my own expenses are rising. Every time I bring up her job search, she gets defensive and says she's applying but not having much luck. I understand that finding a job can be tough, but at this point, I feel like she has become dependent on my financial assistance.

Last week, I finally confronted her about the situation. I told her that I can’t keep supporting her financially and that it’s affecting my own well-being. I suggested she look into cheaper living arrangements or consider taking a job that might not be ideal but could help her get back on her feet. Instead of being understanding, she got upset and accused me of abandoning her when she needs me the most. I felt really guilty after our conversation.

In my defense, I’ve been trying to help her get back on her feet by also offering to help with her resume and job applications. However, I feel like I can’t keep sacrificing my own financial stability for someone who isn’t making a real effort to change their situation.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I (22F) have a younger brother (18M) who recently graduated high school. He had a pretty rough time with his studies, and I tried to help him as much as I could. I even tutored him in math and science, but he often procrastinated and didn't take his assignments seriously. Our parents were really stressed about his grades, and I felt a lot of pressure to help him succeed.

I was trying to teach him how to present and organize his thoughts, but he kept getting distracted and making jokes.

For example, I often find myself doing the dishes, cleaning the bathroom, and taking out the trash while they relax or play video games. I’ve brought it up a few times, and while they apologize, nothing really seems to change.

Last week, I reached my breaking point. I was tired after a long day at work and came home to a messy kitchen. I snapped and confronted my partner about it, expressing my frustration about feeling like I’m doing all the work around the house. My partner got defensive and accused me of being dramatic and not appreciating how hard they work during the week.

In my anger, I may have said some hurtful things, like implying they’re lazy and don’t care about our home. They ended up sulking in the bedroom for the rest of the night, which made me feel guilty. The next day, I apologized for how I spoke but reiterated that we need to figure out a solution for splitting chores fairly.

Now, we’re both feeling upset, and it seems like we’re not making any progress. I feel bad for how I handled my frustration, but I also think my partner needs to step up and take responsibility.

Everyone sucks here,"My sister and I have always had a complicated relationship. We grew up very differently; I was the responsible one who always took on family obligations, while she was more carefree and focused on her own life. Recently, our grandmother passed away, and the family had a small memorial service to honor her. 

I was in charge of organizing the service, which involved coordinating with family members, arranging the venue, and preparing everything. My sister, however, didn’t help at all. She claimed she was too busy with her job and personal life, which I understood to an extent, but it hurt that she wasn’t willing to pitch in for something so important to our family. 

The day of the service was stressful for me. I was running around trying to make sure everything was perfect. I asked my sister to at least show up on time and support me, but she arrived late and seemed disinterested. During the service, she was scrolling through her phone and barely engaged, which upset me deeply. I confronted her later and said I felt she was being incredibly disrespectful to our grandmother's memory and to me. 

In response, my sister snapped back that I was being too controlling and should have just let things go; she felt I was making it all about myself and was being dramatic. I lost my temper and told her that if she didn’t care enough to be involved, maybe she shouldn’t have come at all. 

Now, I feel guilty about how I reacted, but I also think she should have been more considerate. I don’t know if I was too harsh or if she really was being selfish. AITA for how I handled the situation?",394,1584,0.93,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_43921,2021-05-12 00:00:00,ESH,1601,AITA

So, I’ve got a friend, let’s call him Mark. He’s a really laid-back guy, and we’ve hung out for years. Recently, Mark has started dating a girl named Sarah, and they seem to be getting pretty serious. The thing is, Sarah is a huge into fitness and is always posting about her strict diet and workout routines on social media. She’s also very vocal about her opinions on health and wellness, which has made things a bit awkward.

When we all hung out at my place for a game night, I decided to cook dinner for everyone. I made a big pasta dish with garlic bread and a salad, which I thought everyone would enjoy. However, when I served the food, Sarah immediately frowned and said she doesn’t “do carbs.” She then spent dinner lecturing us about how carbs are the enemy and how we should all be eating more protein and veggies.

I found her comments pretty rude since I had put a lot of effort into the meal, and everyone else seemed to enjoy it. I didn’t say anything at first, but after a while, I snapped and said, “Not everyone can live off protein shakes and kale, Sarah.” It got really quiet, and she looked offended. Mark tried to lighten the mood, but the rest of the dinner was pretty tense because of me.

Later, Mark and I talked, and he said that he understood why I was frustrated, but he thought I could have handled it better. I feel like I was justified in standing up for myself, but at the same time, I could have been more tactful. 

So, was I the asshole here for calling her out, or was she being rude first? ESH?",378,2979,0.51,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_21308,2020-05-18 00:00:00,ESH,1678,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Sorry, I'm on mobile.

A little background - my sister and I have always had a bit of a competitive relationship. We grew up in the same household, and our parents often compared us to each other. I’m more academically inclined, while she’s more artistic and social. We love each other, but the rivalry sometimes flares up.

Last weekend, we attended a family gathering at our parents’ house. During the dinner, my sister announced her recent acceptance into an art program she’s been dreaming of, and everyone was super excited for her. They congratulated her, and I clapped and smiled, but honestly, I was feeling a bit overshadowed because I had just won an award at work a week earlier, and nobody knew about it yet.

As the evening went on, I decided to share my news about the award. I thought it would be a good way to balance out the conversation, but as soon as I mentioned it, my sister rolled her eyes and said, “Great, another thing to add to your list of achievements.” The tone was sarcastic, and I felt hurt. In that moment, I snapped back, telling her she shouldn’t be so bitter and that her attitude was a downer.

This led to a heated argument where we each brought up old grievances. She accused me of always needing to be the center of attention, and I told her she was too dramatic and always played the victim. Our parents had to step in, and it turned ugly. I ended up feeling guilty because I know my sister struggles with her self-esteem, but I was also frustrated by her dismissal of my accomplishments.

Now I’m reflecting on it all, and while I think her initial reaction was uncalled for, I also recognize that I could have handled my response better. It was a family gathering, and I shouldn’t have let our rivalry ruin the moment for her.

Lately, we’ve been feeling the strain of balancing work, social life, and our relationship. We’ve gotten into this unhealthy habit of keeping little tabs on each other, which has led to a lot of resentment.

Last week, I had a particularly exhausting week at work and was looking forward to a quiet weekend to recharge. My partner, however, had made plans with his friends to go out on Saturday night, which I knew would mean he’d be out late and tired the next day. I mentioned that I wasn’t really in the mood for socializing and would prefer to have a cozy night in.

He assured me that he would be home early and that it would be nice for him to unwind with his friends. I reluctantly agreed but felt a little hurt that he prioritized his friends over spending time with me. When he finally got home around 2 AM, he was loud and woke me up, and I was frustrated. Instead of talking about it, I snapped at him, saying he was inconsiderate for waking me up after I had asked for a quiet night.

The next day, I tried to talk to him about how I felt, but it turned into a heated argument. He accused me of being controlling and not letting him have a life outside of our relationship, while I accused him of being selfish and not thinking about my needs. It escalated to the point where we both said hurtful things, and I ended up slamming a door in his face.

Everyone sucks here,"Background information. I (28F) have a younger brother (22M) who has always been passionate about music. He's been trying to make a career out of it for the past few years, but he’s also had some trouble keeping a steady job. Recently, he reached out to me for help. He wants to record an EP and needs about $500 to cover studio time and some additional costs. 

I’ve been supportive of his passion, but I’ve also noticed that he often neglects his responsibilities. He frequently borrows money for small things like going out with friends or buying new gear but rarely pays me back. He’s done this multiple times over the past couple of years, and while I understand that pursuing a music career can be tough, it’s frustrating to see him prioritize his wants over his needs.

When he asked me to help him with the $500, I hesitated. I told him I wanted to support him but that I was concerned about his financial habits. He got defensive and said that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for him and that if I truly believed in him, I would help out. I ended up saying no, which led to a heated argument. He accused me of not caring about his dreams and only thinking about money.

After that, I felt guilty. I know how much this means to him, and I want to be a supportive sister. However, I also feel that he needs to learn to manage his finances better and be more responsible about his choices. I don’t want to be enabling him by just giving him money every time he asks.

As we were all hanging out, I overheard a conversation between two of my classmates, Jake (16M) and Lily (15F). They were joking around, but it quickly turned into a conversation about another classmate, Sam (15M), who wasn’t there. 

Jake started making fun of Sam’s appearance, calling him names and laughing about how he dressed. I’ve known Sam for years, and while we’re not super close, I know he struggles with confidence. I felt really uncomfortable listening to this, but I didn’t say anything at first because I didn’t want to ruin the mood of the party.

Eventually, I decided I had to say something. I called Jake out in front of everyone and told him to stop being a jerk. I said Sam didn’t deserve to be talked about like that, especially when he wasn’t there to defend himself. Jake got defensive and told me I was being overly sensitive, which only made me more frustrated. Some of the other kids in the group started to laugh at me for getting involved, and the atmosphere shifted—everyone seemed awkward.

After that, I felt bad because I could see Jake was upset and embarrassed, and I might have taken it too far. I didn’t mean to make a scene, but I genuinely wanted to defend Sam. Later in the night, Jake confronted me again, saying I should have just let him joke around and that I was ruining the fun. He said I act like I’m better than everyone because I want to be the ""morality police."" 

I ended up snapping back at him, saying he was a bully and that maybe he needed to think about how his words affect others. Now, I feel conflicted. I stood up for someone, which I believe was the right thing to do, but I also realize I might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. 

I’m torn between feeling proud of defending Sam and feeling like I might have made things worse by confronting Jake in front of everyone. They all left the party a bit awkwardly, and now I’m worried about how this will affect my friendships.

Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I have been together for about five years, and we recently moved in together. We both have busy jobs, and to help manage our household, we decided to hire a cleaning service. Initially, we agreed on a local company that came highly recommended, and everything seemed to be going smoothly.

However, a few months into this arrangement, I found myself growing increasingly uncomfortable. The cleaner, a young woman in her twenties, was very friendly and chatty, which I initially appreciated. But as time went on, I began to notice my partner seemed to be going out of his way to engage with her. He would often chat and laugh with her while I was in another room, and sometimes he would even stay home from work when she was scheduled to come, which felt odd to me.

I tried to brush it off as paranoia, but then one day, I walked in unexpectedly while she was cleaning our living room, and I caught them sharing a laugh over something trivial. It bothered me more than I’d like to admit. The whole thing felt too cozy for comfort, and I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something inappropriate going on.

Instead of addressing my concerns directly with my partner, I let my frustration build up until one afternoon, I confronted him about it. I accused him of being overly friendly with her and implied that he was crossing a line. He was taken aback and insisted that I was being ridiculous and jealous. He argued that he was just being polite and that I was misinterpreting their interactions.

Feeling defensive, I responded by telling him that if he couldn’t see why I was uncomfortable, then maybe we needed to reconsider our living arrangements or even our relationship. This turned into a heated argument where we both said things we didn’t mean. He accused me of being insecure, and I accused him of being untrustworthy. We ended up shouting at each other, and it was clear that neither of us was backing down.

After the argument, he texted me saying that he needed some space to think about what I said. I felt hurt and angry but also guilty for how the confrontation escalated. I realized that we both could have handled the situation better, and I didn’t help by jumping to conclusions without discussing my feelings first.

But this just caused more tension between us. She confronted me about it, saying I was being passive-aggressive and that I should just talk to her instead of playing games.

In retaliation, I stopped doing all the household chores. I thought maybe she’d realize how much I did around the apartment and step up. Instead, it just turned into a standoff where our living space became messier and messier. We both ended up being frustrated and unhappy.

Now, we’re hardly speaking, and it’s affecting our friendship. I feel bad for how it escalated, but I also think she should take more responsibility. AITA?",794,511,0.63,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_71298,2020-06-23 00:00:00,ESH,1495,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I’ve been living with my best friend, Alex, for the past two years. We’ve known each other since high school, and our friendship has always been strong. When we decided to be roommates, we both agreed to split the bills and take turns cleaning the apartment. It started off great, but as time went on, I noticed Alex wasn’t pulling his weight around the house.

At first, I tried to be understanding. He had a demanding job and was often stressed. I would clean up after him, do the dishes, and take care of most of the chores. However, it started to become a pattern. I was doing almost everything while he would come home, eat, and then either play video games or watch TV without even acknowledging the mess around him.

After a few months, I finally snapped. One day, I called him out on it. I told him that I felt overwhelmed and taken advantage of. Instead of apologizing or trying to change, he got defensive. He said that I should have communicated better and that it wasn't fair to expect him to do everything since I had more free time. This made me feel really hurt and frustrated.

In retaliation, I decided to stop cleaning entirely. I let the dishes pile up, and I didn’t vacuum or take out the trash. I figured that if he saw how disgusting the place was, he would finally step up. Instead, he just ignored it and continued his routine. This went on for a few weeks until one day he lost it and told me that I was being childish and that I should act like an adult instead of throwing a tantrum.

In the heat of the moment, I told him that if he didn't like living in a messy apartment, he could find a new place to live. That really escalated things, and we ended up arguing for hours. Both of us said things we didn’t mean, and it reached a point where we were both just yelling at each other.

Now, things are really tense between us. I feel guilty for letting things get to this point, but I also believe I had a right to be upset about the situation. I think we both contributed to the conflict in different ways.

Everyone sucks here,"I have a friend, Jake, who has always been a bit of a know-it-all. He’s that guy who will argue about anything and everything, even if he has no real expertise on the topic. I’ve often found it frustrating but mostly just ignored it. 

Recently, we were hanging out with a group of friends when the topic of health and fitness came up. Jake started spouting off about how everyone should do intermittent fasting and how it’s the only way to lose weight effectively. A couple of people were interested, but others were skeptical, including my friend Mia, who is a dietitian. 

Mia tried to explain that while intermittent fasting can work for some, it’s not the best approach for everyone, and there are many other healthy eating strategies. Instead of listening, Jake interrupted her multiple times and dismissed her points, insisting that she was just trying to protect her “dietitian turf.” The whole thing escalated quickly, and before I knew it, they were going back and forth, both raising their voices.

In the heat of the moment, I jumped in and called Jake out for being a jerk, saying he was being condescending and that he should respect Mia’s expertise. I also told Mia that she shouldn’t waste her breath on someone who clearly doesn’t want to learn. It felt justified at the moment, but afterward, I realized that I had only added fuel to the fire. 

Both Jake and Mia ended up feeling attacked, and the whole atmosphere turned sour. A couple of our other friends also started distancing themselves from both of them, which made things even more awkward. I tried to smooth things over later, but neither wanted to really talk about it. In the end, I felt like I had contributed to a situation that could have been handled better if I hadn’t let my emotions get the best of me.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I work in a small office with a tight-knit group of coworkers. One of my colleagues, Sarah, has been going through a tough time lately. She recently lost her mother, and it's been hard for her. Everyone in the office has been really supportive, offering her time off and checking in on her regularly.

Last week, Sarah sent out an email to the team, asking if anyone could cover her work for a couple of days because she was feeling overwhelmed and needed some time to grieve. I volunteered to help out, thinking it would lighten her load and show my support.

However, as I started covering her tasks, I found out that she had been missing deadlines and not communicating with clients properly, which was causing a lot of confusion. I expressed my concerns to her privately, suggesting that she should take this time to really focus on getting her work sorted out instead of just stepping away. I thought I was being helpful, but she took it as me undermining her grief and told me I was being insensitive.

To make matters worse, I ended up sharing my frustrations with a couple of other coworkers, saying that it felt unfair that I had to pick up the slack when she wasn’t managing her responsibilities properly. This got back to Sarah, and now she feels betrayed and hurt.

I know I shouldn’t have vented about her like that, and I realize that I may have come off as unsupportive, but I felt overwhelmed too. I was just trying to balance my workload while also helping her out. Now, I feel like I’ve made things worse for everyone involved, and I’m questioning if I was in the wrong for wanting to address the issues while she was grieving.",803,1114,0.93,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_44633,2018-02-28 00:00:00,ESH,1649,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So I (30M) have been really close friends with Jake (30M) since college. We’ve been through a lot together, and I consider him like a brother. Recently, Jake decided to propose to his girlfriend, and naturally, I was thrilled for him. I even offered to help him plan the proposal, which he happily accepted.

Jake and I put together this elaborate plan to surprise her at a beautiful park. We spent weeks organizing it, and I was really excited to see him take that step. The day of the proposal, everything seemed perfect. Jake got down on one knee, and she said yes. It was a beautiful moment, and we all celebrated afterward.

However, during the celebration, I noticed that Jake’s sister, Sarah (28F), who was also there, seemed really upset. I approached her to see what was wrong. She told me that she felt left out of the proposal planning and that she wished Jake had included her. I tried to reassure her that the proposal was Jake’s decision and that he wanted it to be a surprise, but she didn’t seem satisfied with that answer.

Later that week, I received a message from Jake. He told me he had a conversation with Sarah and that she was really hurt by the whole situation. I felt bad, but I also thought it was unfair for her to be upset at me. I didn’t intend to hurt her feelings, and I wasn’t the one who made the decision to exclude her. 

In my response to Jake, I told him that while I understood Sarah’s feelings, I felt like everyone involved had their own role in the proposal planning, and it was ultimately his choice. I suggested that maybe Sarah should talk to him directly instead of placing the blame on me. 

Now, I’m feeling conflicted. I didn’t mean to upset Sarah, but at the same time, I feel like she overreacted, and I shouldn’t be responsible for her feelings.

Recently, I decided to take a step back from the more social aspects of work and focus on my projects. I had some personal issues that made me feel overwhelmed, and I thought it would be best to keep to myself for a while.

One of my coworkers, Sarah, has been trying to reach out to me. She would invite me to coffee breaks and lunch, but I just couldn't bring myself to engage. I appreciate her effort, but I felt like I needed space to sort things out. I would often decline her offers politely, saying I was busy or just not feeling up for it.

Last week, Sarah organized a small birthday celebration for a teammate. When I didn’t show up, she was visibly upset. The next day, she confronted me about my behavior, saying that I’ve been distant and that it hurts her feelings because she genuinely cares. I snapped and told her that I didn’t owe her any explanations and that she was being dramatic. 

Her feelings were hurt, and I could tell I had crossed a line. But I felt overwhelmed and frustrated that she couldn't respect my need for space. Since then, I’ve been feeling guilty for how I reacted, but at the same time, I felt like she didn’t have the right to dictate how I should feel or behave.

Now I'm stuck in this weird place where I feel bad for hurting her feelings, but I also feel like I was justified in wanting to be left alone.

I’m someone who prefers to talk things out immediately when something bothers me, while my partner tends to bottle things up and process them alone before discussing them. This has led to a few misunderstandings and arguments.

Recently, after a minor disagreement about how we spend our weekends, I brought it up right away, expressing my feelings and suggesting we find a compromise. However, my partner was clearly upset and said they needed time to think. I pressed the issue, thinking that talking it out would help, but my partner felt overwhelmed and shut down even more.

After a few days of tension, my partner finally opened up to me about how my pressure to communicate immediately makes them feel anxious. I realized that I had been so focused on resolving the issue that I didn’t respect their need for space. On the other hand, my partner acknowledged that they needed to be more proactive about communicating their feelings instead of waiting until they felt ready.

Now, we’re both upset with each other for different reasons. I feel like I was just trying to resolve things, and they feel like I didn’t respect their boundary. Am I the asshole for wanting to talk things out immediately, or is my partner wrong for not addressing their feelings sooner?

Everyone sucks here,"So here’s the situation: I've been dating my girlfriend for about a year now, and we have a pretty solid relationship. However, I’ve always felt a little uneasy about her friendship with one of her male coworkers. They’ve known each other for a few years, and while I trust her, there’s something about the way he flirts with her that rubs me the wrong way.

A few weeks ago, I noticed she was getting a lot of texts from him late at night. I tried to brush it off, but my curiosity got the better of me, and I ended up checking her phone while she was in the shower. I found a bunch of messages where he was complimenting her and making some not-so-subtle jokes about how they should hang out outside of work. I confronted her about it, and she insisted that it was all in good fun and that she was just being friendly. I told her that it made me uncomfortable, and she promised to set boundaries with him.

Fast forward to last weekend, and we went to a party together. Guess who shows up? Her coworker. I tried to be cordial, but I couldn’t help but feel annoyed. At one point, I saw him pull her aside for a private chat, and I’ll admit, I got jealous. I walked over and interrupted them, making a sarcastic comment about whether they were planning their next “hangout.” She got really defensive and said I was overreacting and making a scene.

Things escalated, and we ended up arguing in front of our friends. I told her I didn't trust her judgment in this situation and that she needed to reconsider her friendship with him. She accused me of being controlling and insecure. I felt bad for blowing up, but I just couldn't shake the feeling that I was right to be concerned.

He’s passionate about it, and I admire that, but things have been tough financially. I’ve been paying most of the bills, and I’ve even taken on extra work to make ends meet. 

Recently, I started feeling overwhelmed and exhausted from the pressure of being the primary breadwinner. I tried to talk to him about it, but he often brushes it off, saying that the business will eventually take off. I understand that starting a business takes time, but I felt like I was carrying the weight of our financial situation on my own.

I told him I needed some time for myself and that it would help me come back feeling refreshed. He seemed supportive at first, but when I mentioned that I would be gone for two days, he got upset. He said that he needed me there to help with some orders and couldn’t manage everything on his own. 

I felt guilty, but I went anyway, thinking it was important for my mental health. During the trip, I had a great time catching up with my family and it did feel like a much-needed break. However, I noticed that my partner was increasingly frustrated when I checked in. He sent me messages about how overwhelmed he was and how he wished I was there to help.

On my way back home, I decided to stop at a bar and unwind a bit before heading back. I had a couple of drinks, which I knew would annoy him if he found out. When I finally got home, he was furious with me. He said that I abandoned him when he needed me the most and that I was being selfish for choosing to take time off while he was struggling. I tried to explain that I needed the break, but it turned into an argument.

My neighbor, whom I’ll call Sarah, is someone I had seen around but hadn’t really spoken to. One day, I was outside and overheard her arguing loudly with someone over the phone. She seemed really upset, and I couldn’t help but feel bad for her.

A few days later, I noticed that Sarah was still looking distressed. I decided to approach her and see if she was okay. During our conversation, she mentioned that she was going through a tough time with her partner, who had been treating her badly. I tried to be supportive, sharing some of my own experiences and offering a listening ear.

As we talked more, I learned that she had been thinking about breaking up with him but was scared of the repercussions. I thought I was being helpful, so I encouraged her to stand up for herself and take the leap. I even suggested a couple of local resources that could help her through the process.

However, while I was trying to be a good neighbor and friend, I didn’t consider how vulnerable she was feeling. A couple of weeks later, I overheard her on another phone call with a friend, and I realized she had decided to break up with her partner after all. But when she found out I had encouraged her, she was furious. Apparently, she hadn’t wanted to tell me about her relationship issues, and she felt I had interfered in a way that made her situation worse. 

Feeling hurt and defensive, I confronted her about it. I told her I was just trying to help and that I never meant to overstep. This turned into a heated argument, where I ended up saying some pretty harsh things about how she shouldn't have shared her personal issues if she didn't want help. 

In the end, I felt bad for how everything had unfolded, and I also felt bad that I had been so wrapped up in my desire to help that I didn’t read her cues properly. Now, we barely speak, and I can sense the tension whenever we cross paths.

Sarah has been dating Tom (32M) for a few months now. They hit it off right away, but I noticed something off about their relationship.

For example, he often checks Sarah's phone and makes comments on who she hangs out with, which really rubbed me the wrong way.

Last week, we had a group outing, and during the night, Sarah confided in me that she felt like Tom was being too possessive and she wasn’t sure if it was just her being paranoid or if it was a real issue. As a friend, I told her that her feelings were valid and that if she felt uncomfortable, she should definitely address it with him. 

She seemed grateful for my support, but then I made the mistake of mentioning this to the rest of our friends. I thought they might share some wisdom, but instead, it turned into a heated debate. Some of them defended Tom, claiming that he just cares a lot about Sarah, while others agreed with me that his behavior was concerning. 

Things escalated when I suggested that Sarah might want to consider if this relationship was healthy for her. This led to Sarah getting defensive, accusing me of trying to meddle in her relationship and not respecting her choices. I felt bad, but I genuinely worried about her well-being.

I tried to steer the conversation to lighter topics, but every time I brought up something fun or interesting, she’d pivot right back to her issues.

Finally, in a moment of frustration, I snapped and said, ""Can we please just talk about something else for a change? I love you, but I’m so tired of this being all we ever talk about."" Sarah got visibly upset and we ended up having a heated discussion where she accused me of being insensitive and not understanding what she was going through.

So, here’s the situation. I (28F) have an older sister (30F) who is getting married soon. She’s always been the dramatic type, and her wedding has turned into a massive production with a budget that seems to keep climbing. I’m happy for her, but it’s been hard to watch her spend money on things that seem excessive, like a $5,000 floral arrangement and a week-long destination bachelorette party.

She approached me a few months ago and asked if I could contribute financially to help cover some of the costs. I’m currently saving for my own house, and with student loans and other bills, I simply can’t afford to give her the amount she’s asking for. I told her I could help in other ways, like helping with DIY projects or planning games, but she brushed that off and insisted that she needed cash.

As the wedding got closer, I noticed her becoming increasingly stressed and taking it out on our family. She would snap at our parents about every little thing, and it was pretty uncomfortable during family gatherings. I offered to have a chat with her about it, but she never really wanted to hear any advice. Instead, she just wanted to vent and get support without considering anyone else's feelings.

Eventually, I decided to stand my ground and told her I wouldn’t be able to help financially. This led to a huge argument where she accused me of not caring about her and being selfish. I reminded her that I was trying to save for my future and that weddings can be expensive. She stormed off and hasn’t spoken to me since.

Now, I feel guilty for not supporting her more, but I also believe I’m entitled to save for my own future. I understand weddings are important, but I felt her expectations were a bit unreasonable.

I tried expressing my feelings to them, but they brushed it off, saying that many older siblings do this and that it builds character. They didn't seem to understand how trapped I felt.

Eventually, I reached a breaking point. One day, I snapped at my parents during dinner after an exhausting day of watching my siblings. I told them how unfair it was that I had to give up my whole summer for them and how it felt like they were using me. They were taken aback and retaliated with how many sacrifices they made for me growing up. It escalated into a huge argument where we all said hurtful things.

Looking back, I regret how I spoke to them and that I didn't approach the situation more calmly. But I also feel like they were really dismissive of my feelings, and I was left feeling unappreciated and overwhelmed. Now, there's this lingering tension in our house, and while I don't think I handled my emotions well, I also feel justified in my frustration.",189,2361,0.99,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_71275,2021-02-08 00:00:00,ESH,1527,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I’m 30 years old, and I work as a graphic designer in a small marketing firm. I’ve been with the company for about three years, and it’s a pretty laid-back environment, or at least it was until recently. 

There’s a new employee, Mike, who is 25 and just graduated from college. He’s enthusiastic and has a lot of good ideas, but he’s also a bit overzealous. A couple of weeks ago, our team was working on a big project for a client, and I was in charge of the design. I put in a lot of effort and late hours to make it perfect.

One day, Mike came up to me and suggested a major change to the design that would require me to start over. I felt frustrated because I had already put in so much work, and I didn’t think his idea was better than what I had. I didn’t handle it well and snapped at him, saying that he needed to respect the time I had already invested. He got quiet and walked away, clearly hurt.

A few days later, we had a team meeting to present our ideas, and I did my best to present my design confidently. However, during the meeting, Mike brought up my reaction to his suggestion and framed it as me being uncooperative and unwilling to collaborate. This caught me off guard, and I felt embarrassed. I defended myself, saying that I just didn’t think it was a good idea and that he should’ve recognized the effort I had already put in.

The whole situation escalated; the team ended up divided over who was in the right. I felt like Mike was trying to undermine me, and I might have been too aggressive in defending myself. The manager ended up suggesting we both take a step back and cool off. 

Now, I feel guilty about how I treated Mike, but I also think his approach was inappropriate in front of the team. A few coworkers have mentioned that the way I addressed things was harsh, but they also agree that Mike should have brought his concerns to me privately. 

So, AITA for snapping at Mike, or was he out of line for bringing it up in front of the team?",174,2344,0.57,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_52882,2023-09-21 00:00:00,ESH,1980,AITA

One day, during a team meeting, a new employee, Sarah, was having trouble sharing her screen. Jake giggled and said, ""Classic! Some people just shouldn’t be allowed near computers.""

I thought it was a bit harsh, so I decided to lighten the mood. I replied, “Yeah, Jake, but I bet you couldn't even set up a printer without Googling it first!” 

Jake got defensive and shot back, “At least I don’t need a manual to figure things out!” That made me mad, so I said, “Well, if we're being honest, I’ve seen you struggle with pretty basic stuff too, like when you couldn’t even reset your password last week!”

The meeting ended awkwardly, and later, Jake told some of our colleagues about my comment. Now, I feel like I made things worse, and some people think I overreacted. Others say Jake was out of line too. We’re both annoyed at each other, and it’s created this weird tension in the office.

Everyone sucks here,"This happened a few days ago at a café where I often work. I was sitting at a table, focused on my laptop, when a group of four people walked in and took the table next to me. They were loud and seemed to be having a good time, which I initially didn’t mind. However, as they got more animated, their voices started to rise, and it became increasingly difficult for me to concentrate on my work.

At one point, one of the guys in the group stood up and started making a scene, loudly reenacting a funny story. He was gesturing wildly and accidentally knocked over a drink that spilled onto my laptop. I was furious and immediately confronted him, raising my voice to make sure he understood.

“Are you serious? You just ruined my laptop! Watch what you're doing!” I said, not caring if I came off as rude. He just laughed it off, insisting it was an accident and that I should relax. I felt even more annoyed, especially since I had already been trying to work in a noisy environment.

At this point, I decided to escalate things. I stood up, pointed at him, and said, “You need to tone it down! You’re being really disrespectful to everyone around you!” 

The rest of his friends looked uncomfortable, and the guy started to defend himself, saying it was just a bit of fun and that I was overreacting. I told him that fun shouldn’t come at the expense of others, and I could see that my outburst was drawing attention. 

Eventually, he apologized, but I could tell he was still mocking me under his breath. I turned to the rest of the group and said, “Maybe if you all learned some basic manners, this wouldn’t happen.”

Everyone sucks here,"Hello everyone,

I (28F) have a younger sister, Emily (22F), who has always been the baby of the family. Our parents (in their late 50s) have doted on her since she was born. Emily has struggled with a few mental health issues, particularly anxiety and depression, and as a result, my parents often treat her with kid gloves, even though she’s an adult now.

For the past few years, I’ve been trying to encourage her to take more responsibility for her life—getting a job, managing her own finances, and seeking therapy. I believe it’s important for her to learn to stand on her own two feet and develop life skills, but my parents think I'm being too harsh and should give her more support.

Recently, Emily was invited to a close friend’s wedding, and she was excited about it. However, a few days before the wedding, she started to feel overwhelmed and asked our parents to go with her. They immediately agreed, but I found out that they planned to babysit her throughout the entire event, making sure she wouldn’t feel anxious.

I didn’t think that was a good idea, so I expressed my concerns. I suggested that Emily should go alone, as it would be a great opportunity for her to practice independence. My parents got defensive and said I was being unsupportive. I told them that they were enabling her fears and that I was tired of watching them coddle her. This led to a huge argument where both my parents and Emily ended up crying. 

In the heat of the moment, I said some things I regret. I called Emily “pathetic” for not being able to handle a social situation and told my parents they were “raising a child, not an adult.” It was cruel, and I could see the hurt in their eyes. Afterward, I felt awful and tried to apologize, but my parents said they needed some space from me, and Emily hasn’t spoken to me since.

I understand that I was harsh, but I genuinely want what’s best for Emily. However, I also realize that I could have approached the situation more compassionately. Everyone is upset, and I feel guilty about the way things escalated. What do you all think? AITA?",19,1112,0.88,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_29866,2023-06-11 00:00:00,ESH,2088,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Throwaway account because I think my friends might be lurking here. 

So, I've been friends with this couple, Lisa and Mark, for a few years now. We met in college and bonded over our shared love for board games and outdoor adventures. They were one of those couples that just seemed so perfect together and I always enjoyed hanging out with them. But lately, things have taken a weird turn.

Last summer, I started to notice that Lisa was becoming increasingly competitive, especially during our game nights. At first, it was just a friendly rivalry, but it quickly escalated into her getting really aggressive about winning. She would berate Mark if he made a mistake or did something she deemed ""stupid."" I often felt uncomfortable just sitting there, watching her put him down in front of us.

Despite this, I tried to remain neutral and not take sides. I would occasionally joke with Mark about how we needed to team up against her in games, which I thought would lighten the mood, but Lisa would react defensively, making it clear that she didn’t appreciate my attempts at humor. 

Things came to a head when we had a game night at my place a few weeks ago. Lisa was particularly harsh that night. After one game, she started yelling at Mark for not following her ""obvious"" strategy, calling him names that I honestly found shocking. I tried to interject and say it was just a game, but it only made her angrier. She turned on me and accused me of being a bad friend for not supporting her.

After that night, I felt really uncomfortable and decided to distance myself from them a bit. I still wanted to maintain my friendship with Mark, but I just couldn't handle Lisa's toxic behavior. I didn't tell Mark the real reason I was pulling back, thinking it might just create more drama.

Now, I've been hanging out more with other friends, and Mark has reached out a few times asking if everything is okay. I always say I’ve just been busy with work or other commitments. I've been feeling guilty, but I really don’t want to deal with the fallout of telling him the truth, especially since it feels like I’m putting him in the middle.

To give you some background, we've been friends for several years and generally get along well. However, she has a tendency to make jokes at my expense, claiming it's all in good fun. While I usually let it slide, there was a specific incident during the trip that really upset me.

One evening, we were all hanging out and playing games.

Last week, I was hosting game night, and I decided to introduce a new board game that I thought everyone would enjoy. I had read good reviews about it, and I was excited to see how it would go over. When everyone arrived, I set up the game and explained the rules. However, A immediately started nitpicking the rules, claiming they were flawed, and B jumped in to back him up, teasing A about how competitive he was.

At first, I thought it was all in good fun, but as we started playing, A kept interrupting, questioning every single move and getting increasingly frustrated. B, trying to lighten the mood, continued to make snarky comments about A’s competitiveness and how he was ruining the fun. This, of course, only made A more agitated, and soon, they were both going back and forth with snarky remarks.

He looked like he was ready for a workout rather than a nice dinner, and it definitely clashed with the more casual but put-together vibe we were going for.

Everyone sucks here,"My brother (30M) and I (28F) have always had a complicated relationship, especially since he got married a few years ago. His wife, who I’ll call “Sarah” (28F), has a very different personality than mine—she’s overly friendly and a bit too much at times. We’ve had our disagreements in the past, but I’ve tried to put them aside for the sake of family gatherings.

Recently, we had a family reunion planned for a weekend. My brother and Sarah were hosting it at their house, and they asked everyone to bring a dish to share. I offered to bring my famous lasagna, which everyone loves. 

The day before the reunion, Sarah texted me asking if I could bring a dessert instead because she wanted more variety. I felt a bit annoyed since she didn’t ask anyone else to change their dish, but I agreed to bring a dessert to keep the peace. I whipped up a batch of brownies, which I thought would be a hit.

When we arrived at the reunion, I noticed Sarah had already prepared a ton of desserts, including a huge cake and several pies. I felt a little frustrated because it seemed like she just wanted to control the food. During the event, I decided to voice my displeasure to a few family members, jokingly saying that I felt like my brownies were unnecessary since there was already so much dessert.

I didn’t mean to make a big deal out of it, but my brother overheard me and got upset. He confronted me later, saying I was being rude and ungrateful for all the effort Sarah put into the reunion. I argued that I was just expressing my feelings and that it was frustrating to change my plans at the last minute. 

Things escalated, and I ended up saying some hurtful things about how Sarah often tries to micromanage family events. My brother was furious and told me I was always undermining his wife. Family members started taking sides, and it turned into a whole mess.

Now, I feel guilty for how I handled the situation, but I also think my brother shouldn’t have acted like a protective husband and should have taken my feelings into account. I know I shouldn’t have brought it up in the first place, but I thought it was harmless.

He was rude, dismissive, and would often make fun of our inside jokes, which really bothered us.

One night, we had a planned get-together, and Sarah asked if she could bring Mike along. I hesitated, knowing he had been disrespectful in the past, but I didn’t want to hurt Sarah’s feelings, so I said okay. When he arrived, things got tense. He started making jokes at our expense, and I finally snapped and told him to leave. Sarah was furious and accused me of ruining her night and being a bad friend for not even trying to get to know him.

I felt guilty for how I reacted, but I also thought I had a right to defend our group’s dynamic. The next day, I apologized to Sarah for the way I handled it but stood by my decision to ask Mike to leave. She hasn’t spoken to me since, and now I feel like I’ve lost a friend over this.

Everyone sucks here,"I recently went to a friend’s birthday party, and it was a pretty casual gathering at a bar. I hadn’t seen some of our mutual friends in a while, so I was excited to catch up. During the evening, the topic shifted to travel, and I shared how I had just returned from a trip to Europe, which was an incredible experience for me.

As I was describing the beautiful places I visited and the culture I experienced, one friend, Mark, interrupted me and started talking about how travel is a waste of money and how people should focus on more important issues, like environmental conservation. He went on about how flying contributes to pollution and how it was selfish of people to travel when there are so many problems in the world.

I found this a bit frustrating because I felt like he was belittling my experience and not allowing me to share something I was excited about. So, I snapped back and told him that while I appreciated his concerns, not everything has to be about saving the planet, and sometimes people just want to enjoy life and explore the world. I added that he could be more supportive of friends' joy instead of always being the moral police.

This escalated into a heated argument where he accused me of being ignorant and privileged for traveling, while I called him overly self-righteous and condescending. The rest of our friends were caught in the middle, some siding with me and others agreeing with him. It ended with us both feeling really upset, and neither of us really backed down.

One weekend, we all decided to go out for drinks to celebrate Emma's new relationship. While we were out, Jake was really nice to everyone, but I noticed he made some really off-color jokes that made me uncomfortable. He joked about ""needing to keep the women in line"" and made a comment about how relationships were like ownership. I tried to brush it off, thinking maybe he was just trying to be funny, but it didn't sit right with me.

Later that night, after a few drinks, Emma and Jake started getting a bit flirty, which was fine. But then Jake started making comments about how Emma should be grateful he was into her, and that she needed to ""keep up her end of the deal"" in the relationship. I didn't want to ruin the vibe, but I felt like I had to say something. So I pulled Emma aside and told her I thought Jake's comments were disrespectful and that she deserved better.

Emma got really defensive and told me I was overreacting. She said I was just jealous because I was single and that I shouldn't interfere in her relationship. I felt bad, but I genuinely thought I was looking out for her. Later, when we went back to the group, I ended up snapping at Jake, telling him he needed to watch his mouth around women. He got angry and called me rude, which led to a heated argument that ended our night on a very sour note.

Now, Emma is upset with me for creating drama, and I feel bad for ruining the evening. I thought I was standing up for my friend, but maybe I overstepped.

We have always had a complicated relationship, especially since she feels overshadowed by my accomplishments and has often expressed jealousy. When she announced her engagement, I was genuinely happy for her, but I could tell she was already stressed about the wedding.

A few weeks ago, she called me in tears, saying that her wedding planner had cancelled and she was freaking out about the whole thing. I offered to help her plan the wedding, thinking it would be a great way to bond and support her during this stressful time. However, as we started working together, it quickly became clear that she was not receptive to my ideas. Every suggestion I made, no matter how small, was met with resistance. It felt like she wanted my help but only on her terms.

Frustrated, I started to withdraw and began to think about my own plans for a future wedding. I shared some of those ideas with my close friends, which ended up being a mistake. When my sister found out, she accused me of trying to steal her thunder and “planning my wedding in secret.” I tried to explain that I was just dreaming about my own future, but she was inconsolable.

In the heat of the argument, I told her that if she was going to be so difficult about planning her wedding, maybe she should have just eloped. I didn't mean it seriously; I was just frustrated with how she was handling everything. But she took it to heart and said that if I didn't want to help her without being critical, then I shouldn't help at all.

It’s a beautiful antique vase that our grandmother passed down to us. When Grandma died last year, my sister and I discussed how we would divide her belongings fairly. 

I wanted to keep the vase because it reminded me of the many family gatherings we had and how Grandma loved to fill it with fresh flowers. My sister, however, wanted it too, saying it was her favorite piece. We decided to take a vote with our other siblings, and they sided with me, saying it made more sense for me to keep it since I had a bigger house and could display it properly.

A few weeks later, I found out my sister had taken a picture of the vase and was posting about it on social media, saying it was her favorite heirloom and how she missed it. I felt like she was trying to undermine my decision and make me look like the bad guy in front of our family and friends. I confronted her about it, and we ended up getting into a huge argument. She told me that I was selfish for not letting her have it and that I should have considered her feelings. 

In retaliation, I posted a picture of the vase on my own social media and wrote about how it’s meaningful to me and how I’d always cherish it. This just escalated things further, and now we’re not speaking. Our parents are upset because they think we both handled it poorly.

Jake always shows up with an attitude and has a habit of making fun of my cooking, which really annoys me. He gets a kick out of acting like a food critic, even when I’m just trying to feed everyone.

During the barbecue, I made a big pot of chili and some grilled burgers. As soon as Jake arrived, he took one look at my chili and scoffed, saying it looked like “sludge” and that he’d never eat it. I rolled my eyes but tried to brush it off. However, as the day went on, he kept making snide comments about my food, and it started to ruin my mood.

Finally, feeling frustrated, I made a joke at his expense, saying that maybe he should stick to frozen dinners since he clearly has no appreciation for real cooking. The rest of the family laughed, and I felt a small sense of victory. But my comment escalated things, and Jake got visibly upset. He started yelling about how he was just trying to have a good time, and I was ruining it with my stupid chili.

After that, things got tense. I ended up telling him that if he didn’t like my food, he was welcome to leave. Instead, he grabbed a burger and stormed off to sit on the porch. The rest of the family was caught in the middle, and they were uncomfortable with the whole situation.

In the end, we both ended up feeling hurt. I shouldn’t have stooped to his level with a hurtful comment, and he should have known better than to make fun of my cooking in the first place. It turned the whole barbecue into a disaster, and now I feel like everyone is annoyed with both of us.

Sarah and I have been friends for over five years, and we often enjoy hanging out, especially on weekends. Recently, she finally got a promotion at work, and we decided to celebrate by going out for dinner. 

I had been feeling stressed about work and finances, and I didn't want to spend much that night. I suggested a casual pizza place instead of the fancy restaurant Sarah had in mind. She seemed a bit disappointed but agreed. When we got to the pizza place, I ordered a simple slice and a drink while she went for a full meal and a couple of drinks. 

During dinner, Sarah excitedly talked about her new promotion, and I found myself getting a little envious. I mean, I’m happy for her, but it’s hard not to compare myself to my friends, especially when I’m struggling a bit financially. So, in a moment of frustration, I made a sarcastic comment about how I guess promotions come with a pay raise to treat yourself, right? She laughed it off, but I felt the mood shift a little.

Later, I noticed that Sarah had ordered dessert, and I joked, “Wow, must be nice to be able to splurge like that!” This time, she didn’t laugh. Instead, she looked a bit hurt and pointed out that just because she can afford to treat herself doesn’t mean she’s not also managing her own financial struggles. 

Feeling guilty, I tried to backtrack and said I didn’t mean to sound bitter, but she responded that it felt like I was belittling her success. I got defensive and brought up how I always cheer her on, but she called me out for being passive-aggressive. The conversation ended awkwardly, and she kept quiet for the rest of dinner.

As the date approached, I got really excited and started sending out invitations. I made it clear that it would be a formal dinner and encouraged everyone to dress up a bit.

Everyone sucks here,"My 12-year-old son, Ethan, has recently developed a strong interest in gaming, which I absolutely understand given how popular it is. However, my wife, Sarah, is really against it. She believes that video games are a waste of time and are detrimental to Ethan's development. I can see her point, but I also think gaming can offer some benefits, like problem-solving skills and social interaction with his friends.

The other day, Sarah confronted Ethan about his gaming habits and was really harsh. She told him he was wasting his potential and that he needed to focus on his schoolwork instead. I could see Ethan was upset, and I felt it was unfair, so I intervened. I told Sarah that she was being too hard on him and that I thought he should be allowed to have some fun. We ended up arguing, and it got pretty heated. I suggested that we should compromise and set some limits on his gaming rather than banning it outright, but Sarah was adamant that it was all or nothing.

In the heat of the moment, I accused her of being controlling and not understanding how to connect with Ethan. That really escalated things, and now neither of us is talking to each other properly. Ethan is stuck in the middle, feeling guilty for causing the rift between us, and I feel guilty for not supporting my wife, but I also want to support my son.

Looking back, I realize I might have overstepped by undermining Sarah in front of Ethan. I don’t think she handled it well either, though. So, am I the asshole for trying to defend my son, or is she the asshole for being too harsh?

Everyone sucks here,"I recently started working at a small café, and I was excited to join the team. The staff is mostly younger, and we all get along pretty well. However, there’s one co-worker, Jake, who has been with the café for a while. He’s a decent guy but tends to make offhanded comments that can be pretty rude. 

One day, while we were prepping for the lunch rush, Jake started mocking a new barista named Mia. She was struggling a bit with the coffee machine, and instead of offering to help her, he was making jokes about how she must have never seen one before. It was embarrassing for Mia, and I could tell she was feeling really uncomfortable. 

I decided to step in and called Jake out on his behavior. I told him that it wasn’t cool to treat her that way and that he should be more supportive. Jake responded by saying I was overreacting and that it was just his sense of humor. We ended up getting into a bit of a heated argument, and I might have raised my voice a bit more than necessary.

Later, Mia came up to me and thanked me for defending her, but she also mentioned that I might have overstepped by confronting Jake in front of everyone. I felt bad because I didn’t want to create a divide in the team, but I also couldn’t just stand by and watch him bully her.

Now I’m feeling conflicted. Did I do the right thing by defending Mia, or did I make things worse by calling out Jake in front of everyone? AITA for confronting him about it?",396,2193,0.72,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_67296,2021-08-04 00:00:00,ESH,1443,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Hello, throwaway account because I don’t want my friends to find this.

I (27M) recently went on a weekend trip with a group of friends, including my friend Dave (26M) and his girlfriend Sarah (25F). We’ve all been friends for years, but I’ve always had a bit of a rivalry with Dave. It’s all in good fun, but sometimes it can get a little intense.

On the trip, we were playing some drinking games and things started to escalate. Dave and I were joking back and forth, and at one point, I made a comment about how he can’t handle his liquor. He took it in stride, but then he shot back saying that I was just jealous because I couldn’t keep up. I laughed it off, but it started to get a little heated.

Later on, we were all sitting around the fire, and someone suggested we share embarrassing stories. Dave ended up telling a story about how he once got so drunk he accidentally texted his mom a picture of his junk. Everyone laughed, and it was all fun until he turned to me and said, “At least I’m not the one who had to call my ex to apologize for my weird foot fetish.”

I was caught off guard. It’s true—I had a weird foot fetish that my ex found out about and it didn’t end well. In a moment of anger, I blurted out, “At least I don’t look like a budget version of Ryan Gosling.” It was a low blow, and I immediately regretted saying it, but the alcohol was flowing, and the mood was tense.

The group got quiet, and Dave looked visibly hurt. Sarah shot me a glare, and I could tell I crossed a line. I tried to lighten the mood by cracking a joke, but it didn’t work. Things got awkward, and people started to leave the fire.

Later that night, Sarah confronted me and said that I really crossed a line with Dave and that I should apologize. I felt bad, but I also thought he took the joke too seriously. I told her that he shouldn’t dish it out if he can’t take it, but she insisted that I was being an asshole and needed to drop it.

Now I’m just feeling guilty and wondering if I really was the jerk here, or if Dave is being overly sensitive about it. I can see both sides.

Everyone sucks here,"My wife (35f) and I (37m) have been married for ten years, and we've always made it a point to prioritize our relationship above all else. However, things have been tense lately due to my sister (30f) and her struggles. She has been going through a rough patch in her life, recently losing her job and going through a difficult breakup. I've always been close to her, but my wife feels that I give her too much attention and emotional support, which she believes takes away from our time together.

A few weeks ago, my sister asked me to help her with some job applications and even offered to stay with us for a while. I agreed, thinking it was just temporary support. My wife was frustrated when I told her about it, feeling like my sister's problems were overshadowing our own life. I tried to reassure her that it would just be for a short time, but my sister’s stay turned into several weeks. She started to become a regular presence in our home, taking over the living room with her job search clutter and often interrupting our evenings together.

Things came to a head when my wife suggested that I should set boundaries with my sister, but I brushed it off, wanting to be there for her. One night, after a particularly stressful day, my wife snapped. She said I wasn’t being fair by prioritizing my sister over our marriage and that I needed to step up. I got defensive and told her that family should come first, and that she was being unsupportive. I ended up shouting that she was being selfish for not wanting to help my sister during a tough time. 

My sister overheard the argument and started crying, and I instantly felt guilty for dragging her into our conflict. I then tried to calm her down, but my wife was furious. She told me that I was failing to see how my sister's presence was damaging to our relationship. I could tell I hurt my wife, but I genuinely felt torn between my loyalty to my sister and my commitment to my wife.

Now, my sister has found a job and is planning to move out soon, but the damage is done. My wife and I are still at odds about how I handled the situation. I feel bad for how things spiraled, but I also feel like my wife could have been a bit more understanding of my sister's needs. Am I the asshole for wanting to support my sister during her tough time, or was my wife right to feel neglected?",27,1424,0.98,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_90355,2019-01-16 00:00:00,ESH,2348,AITA

One of my friends, Jake, has been going through a tough time and has been very vocal about it. I care about him, but he tends to dominate conversations and can be a bit of a downer when he’s feeling low. 

I didn’t want my birthday to be overshadowed by Jake's negativity, so I didn’t invite him. I felt bad, but I thought it was best for the atmosphere of the party. The night of the party, things were going well, and everyone was having a great time until I got a text from Jake saying he was outside and heard the music. He didn’t want to crash the party, but he was feeling lonely and hoped to join for a bit.

I didn’t know what to do. Part of me felt guilty for leaving him out, but I also didn’t want him to bring down the mood. I ended up texting back that it was a small gathering and maybe it was best if he didn’t come in. I felt terrible but thought it was for the best.

Later that night, I got a call from another friend, Sarah, who was at the party. She was upset I didn’t invite Jake, saying he really needed a friend right now and that it wasn’t cool to leave him out. I explained my reasoning, but she still thought I was being selfish.

I guess I wasn’t the only one who felt awkward about the situation because even during the party, I overheard some of my friends discussing how they felt bad for Jake. I ended up feeling guilty, thinking maybe I should have just invited him or at least let him come in for a little while.

We've always had a close bond, but over the years, I’ve noticed some concerning behaviors from her, particularly in how she treats people. Recently, she started making jokes at the expense of our mutual friends, often crossing the line into hurtful territory. At first, I brushed it off, but it became more frequent and more cruel.

One night, during a group dinner, she made a particularly nasty joke about one of our friends' recent struggles with anxiety. The entire table went silent, and I could see the hurt on our friend’s face. I snapped and called my friend out in front of everyone, telling her that her jokes were not funny and that she needs to stop being so cruel. She got defensive and said I was being overly sensitive and that ""it was just a joke."" Tensions escalated, and I ended up leaving the dinner early.

Afterward, I felt bad about how I handled the situation. I should have talked to her privately instead of calling her out in front of everyone. But at the same time, I was really upset with her behavior, and I honestly felt she needed a wake-up call. Our mutual friends have since told me that they appreciated me standing up for them, but now my friend is upset with me and has distanced herself.

I think it’s because my dog is quite high-energy and tends to bark a lot, especially when she’s excited.

I love hosting, but this time there were a few too many people for my liking. I decided to set some ground rules ahead of time, especially since my cousin, who I’ll call Jake, has a reputation for being a bit rowdy and making everything about him.

I put together a nice spread of food, and I made it clear that everyone should pitch in with drinks. I set up a cooler outside with a mix of drinks and labeled it ""BYOB - Feel free to add to the cooler!"" I also had a couple of bottles of wine that I had been saving for a special occasion, but I thought I’d share them since it was a reunion.

As the evening progressed, things were going well until Jake started getting a bit too loud and boisterous. He kept trying to dominate the conversations and was even taking over the music playlist. I tried to keep things light, but I could see my other relatives getting annoyed with him too. 

At one point, I noticed that he had opened one of the bottles of wine that I had set aside. I confronted him, saying, “Hey, that’s really not for the party. I wanted to save it for a different occasion.” He laughed it off and said he didn’t think it was a big deal since I had opened the other bottle first. I was already feeling frustrated with him, and instead of keeping my cool, I said something like, “You always do this, Jake! It’s not just about you!”

Things escalated, and I ended up telling him that he needed to leave if he couldn’t respect my home and my rules. The atmosphere became tense, and other family members were clearly uncomfortable.

Everyone sucks here,"I’ll try to keep this brief. 

So, I (27F) have a close friend, Lisa (26F), who has recently started her own small baking business. I’ve always loved her cakes and have been supportive since the beginning. A few months ago, she asked me to be her maid of honor since she was planning a big wedding for next year. I was excited and immediately said yes.

When she started talking about her wedding plans, she mentioned she would like to have a dessert table filled with her baked goods. I thought it was a great idea, but I also suggested that she consider hiring a professional baker for the wedding cake since it’s a big day and it might be too much pressure for her to juggle everything. She seemed offended and said she wanted to do it all herself.

As the planning continued, Lisa was clearly overwhelmed. She started texting me late at night asking for help, which I was more than willing to provide. But one night, after spending hours helping her with her wedding timeline, she casually mentioned that she might not have time to do the cakes and would consider just buying them from a bakery. I was honest with her and suggested that if she was feeling that stressed, it might be best to delegate the cake and focus on other aspects of her wedding.

That’s when things got heated. Lisa snapped at me, saying I didn’t believe in her or her business. I was taken aback but tried to explain that I was just trying to help her manage her stress. She accused me of being unsupportive and told me that if I couldn’t back her up, I shouldn’t have accepted the role of maid of honor in the first place.

Feeling hurt, I fired back that she was being unrealistic about what she could handle. I told her that it was okay to ask for help and that she didn’t have to do everything on her own. It turned into a huge argument, and now we haven't spoken in weeks. 

To complicate matters, I have mutual friends who are torn between us. A couple of them have sided with Lisa, saying I'm being too harsh and not supportive enough, while others think she overreacted. I feel hurt by her accusations, especially since I wanted to help her succeed.

Recently, Sarah got super excited about a new job opportunity and asked for my opinion on her outfit for the interview. I could tell she had been working hard on her appearance, and while I appreciated that, I didn’t think her outfit was appropriate for a professional setting. I told her that the dress she had chosen was a bit too casual and that she might want to consider something more business-like. She looked really hurt and said I was being overly critical.

In response, I got defensive and told her that if she was going to ask for my advice, she needed to be prepared for honest feedback. I then mentioned that I thought her last interview outfit was also a bit off, and maybe she just had a pattern of choosing outfits that didn’t help her make the best impression. She snapped back that I was just jealous because she was getting a job opportunity I had applied for but didn’t get.

On the day of the party, things started off well, but soon Sam got into a disagreement with another kid over a game. Instead of resolving it calmly, he started yelling and pushed the other kid. I intervened and asked him to calm down and take a break. Instead, he threw a toy in frustration, hitting one of the other kids. That was the last straw for me. 

I ended up asking Sam to leave the party. I told him that if he couldn't behave, he couldn't stay. His mom was at the party and she was understandably upset. She yelled at me for kicking her son out and said I was being unfair, that kids will be kids. I tried to explain that I was just trying to keep the environment safe and fun for everyone, but it turned into a heated argument. 

Things got awkward after that, and the rest of the party felt tense. In the end, I felt bad for kicking him out, but I also felt justified because I didn't want the other kids to feel uncomfortable or unsafe. 

Now, I’m left wondering if I was too harsh on Sam or if I was right to prioritize the group’s safety over one kid’s behavior. Was I the asshole for kicking him out, or was I justified in wanting a good time for everyone else? 

TLDR: I kicked out a disruptive kid from my son's birthday party to maintain a safe environment, but now I feel bad about it. Am I the asshole?",785,1941,0.73,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_61260,2020-01-14 00:00:00,ESH,1990,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, I’m in a bit of a dilemma and honestly, I’m feeling really conflicted about everything that happened. I’m hoping to get some perspective on whether I was in the wrong here. 

My sister “Kate” recently got engaged, and I couldn’t be happier for her. She’s been planning her wedding for months and asked me to be her maid of honor. I was excited and honored to help her out. However, a few weeks ago, she decided to have a small engagement party at her house and invited a few family members and close friends, including me.

The party was nice, but during the evening, Kate started to mention how she was trying to decide on a wedding theme. She was tossing around ideas and finally mentioned that she was thinking about an elegant garden theme with lots of flowers and pastel colors. In an attempt to share my thoughts and be supportive, I jokingly said, “Well, just be sure it doesn’t end up looking like a kid’s birthday party, okay?” I thought it would lighten the mood, but it didn’t land the way I expected.

Kate looked visibly hurt and asked me what I meant by that. I tried to explain that I was just joking, but she started to get defensive, saying she had put a lot of thought into it and didn’t appreciate my comment. I should have dropped it, but I insisted that I was just trying to help and that I didn’t mean to offend her. This escalated into a bit of a back-and-forth where I was trying to clarify my intentions, and she was getting increasingly more upset.

Eventually, my mom intervened and tried to mediate, but it didn’t help. Kate ended up leaving the room in tears, and the atmosphere of the party shifted dramatically. I felt terrible and wanted to apologize, but I also felt like my intentions were misunderstood.

The next day, I reached out to Kate to apologize for hurting her feelings. She told me she just needed some space and wasn't ready to talk. Now I’m left wondering if I was the asshole for making the joke in the first place, and if I should have just kept my mouth shut or if she overreacted. 

So, AITA for trying to joke around with my sister about her wedding theme?",158,2433,0.79,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_79003,2019-12-27 00:00:00,ESH,2112,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, I've been living with my roommate for the past year. We get along most of the time, but we definitely have our differences. I'm more of a laid-back person, while he tends to be a bit more uptight and serious. We both have our own social circles, but we've also become friends over time.

Recently, I started dating someone who I met through mutual friends. She's great, but she's also a bit more spontaneous and outgoing than I am. My roommate has expressed concerns about her, saying that he feels she's too much of a party person and that she brings a negative energy into our home. I’ve tried to talk to him about it, but he just keeps insisting that I should be more careful with who I bring around.

A few weekends ago, I hosted a small get-together at our place, inviting friends over, including my girlfriend. My roommate was out that night, but I still wanted to have a good time. I thought everyone got along well enough, and honestly, it was a pretty low-key gathering.

However, my roommate came home early the next morning and was furious. He said the house was a mess, there were empty bottles everywhere, and he felt uncomfortable with the way my girlfriend and some of my friends were acting. He made a big deal out of it, accusing me of disrespecting our shared living space and being irresponsible.

In the heat of the moment, I snapped back at him, saying he was overreacting and that he should just lighten up. I told him that it was my life and I could invite whomever I wanted. He fired back that I was being selfish and that I needed to consider how my choices affected him.

Now, we’re both in a bit of a standoff. I feel bad for raising my voice and dismissing his feelings, but I also think he’s being a bit controlling. My girlfriend thinks he overstepped his boundaries too, but I can't help but feel like maybe we both could have handled the situation differently.

So, am I the asshole for snapping at my roommate, or is he being unreasonable? I just want to maintain my relationship without causing friction in our living situation.",332,1256,0.93,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_26220,2019-01-16 00:00:00,ESH,2066,AITA

I work in a field that I love, but she constantly compares me to my brother, who is a lawyer, and tells me how much more successful he is. It’s frustrating because I’ve never felt supported by her.

Recently, she organized a family dinner and invited my brother, his wife, and my partner. I decided to bring my partner along because I wanted them to meet my family. During dinner, my mother started her usual comments about my job, saying things like, “You know, if you’d gone to law school like your brother, you could have been more successful.” I tried to brush it off, but it kept escalating. At one point, I snapped and told her that maybe if she spent more time supporting me instead of comparing me to my brother, we wouldn’t have this issue. 

My mother got really upset and started crying, saying I was being disrespectful and that I should be grateful for the opportunities I’ve had. The dinner turned tense, and my brother took her side, saying I was overreacting and should just let it go. My partner was uncomfortable, and I ended up leaving early.

Afterwards, I felt guilty for losing my temper, but I also felt justified in finally standing up for myself. I’ve been reflecting on how I handled the situation. I know my mother can be difficult, but maybe I should have found a better way to address it instead of exploding. On the other hand, my mother should probably learn to be more supportive and not so critical.

Recently, my younger brother started a new job that he’s really excited about, and he’s been sharing all of his experiences with me. I generally try to be supportive, but I can’t help but feel a bit jealous. 

A few weeks ago, he told me about a project he was working on that was getting him a lot of attention at work. Instead of congratulating him, I made a sarcastic comment about how he must be the “golden child” now. He was visibly hurt, and I could tell I had crossed a line. He called me out on it, and instead of apologizing, I brushed it off, saying I was just joking and he needed to lighten up.

Fast forward a few days, and I came home from a rough week at work, and I vented to my brother about how I’ve been feeling unappreciated in my job. Instead of listening, he turned it into a competition about whose job was harder. We went back and forth, and it escalated to the point where we were both yelling at each other. In the heat of the moment, I told him he wouldn’t last a week in my job, and he shot back that I was just bitter because I couldn’t handle success.

Afterward, we both felt pretty terrible about the fight. I know I shouldn’t have let my jealousy dictate my actions, and I feel bad for being dismissive of his achievements.

I live with my sister, who has this habit of leaving her dirty dishes piled up in the sink for days. I’ve tried talking to her about it, but she always brushes me off, saying she’ll get to it “eventually.” It really annoys me, especially since I’m the one who ends up washing them when it gets unbearable. 

The other day, I had a bunch of friends over for a game night. I had cleaned up the living room and the dining area, but when I went to the kitchen, I saw her dishes were still there, and it looked disgusting. I decided I had enough. Instead of just washing them, I dumped all her dirty dishes—like, plates, cups, everything—on her bed while she was at work, along with a note that said “Maybe you’ll take care of this if it’s in your face.”

When she got home and saw what I had done, she flipped out. We ended up shouting at each other, and I told her she needed to grow up and be more responsible. She called me a jerk and said I was making a big deal out of nothing.

I’ve never been a fan of hers; she seems self-centered and often cuts Sam off during conversations, and I’ve noticed she tries to dominate the group whenever we hang out. 

Last weekend, we all went to a concert together. During the show, I was really excited and started singing along to one of our favorite songs. I saw Sam enjoying it too, but Lisa turned and told me to shut up because I was ruining her experience. I got flustered and snapped back that the concert was for everyone, not just her, and I just wanted to enjoy the music. She rolled her eyes and went back to ignoring me, which annoyed me even more.

After the concert, things escalated when we all went for drinks. Lisa started venting to Sam about how rude I was, and instead of defending me, Sam just sat there awkwardly. I felt betrayed, so I confronted him about it later, and we ended up having a heated argument. I told him he needed to stand up for his friends instead of letting her treat us poorly.

We’ve been living together for about a year, and generally, we get along pretty well. However, my roommate has this habit of leaving his dirty dishes piled up in the sink for days. I’ve tried to talk to him about it a few times, but he always brushes it off, saying he’ll get to it when he has time. I’m not a neat freak, but I believe in basic cleanliness, especially in shared spaces.

Last week, I finally reached my breaking point. He had left a particularly gross pile of dishes for almost a week, and I was tired of it. So, while he was at work, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I took all of his dirty dishes, which included some pretty rancid stuff, and dumped them in his room.

When he got home, he was furious. He confronted me and called me immature for doing that. I snapped back, telling him it was immature of him to expect me to live with his mess. We had a huge argument, and I think we both said some hurtful things. He accused me of being a control freak, and I told him he was lazy and inconsiderate.

In the end, we both apologized, but the tension lingered. I feel like I shouldn’t have taken it to that level, but at the same time, I was so frustrated with his lack of accountability.

One day, a group of four college students came in and settled at a large table, which was fine since we weren’t too busy at the time.

After they ordered, they started to get quite loud, laughing and joking, which quickly escalated into them making some inappropriate comments and jokes that made a few other customers uncomfortable. I politely went over to their table and asked them to keep it down a bit, explaining that other customers might not appreciate the volume or the nature of the jokes. They scoffed at me and continued talking loudly, so I decided to involve my manager.

My manager approached them and reiterated my request, but they still didn’t take it seriously. At this point, I was really frustrated. I went back to their table and said, “Look, if you can’t keep it down, I’m going to have to ask you to leave. This isn’t a frat party.” The group grew silent for a moment, and then one of the guys shot back, “Wow, chill out. We’re just having fun.”

They ended up leaving in a huff, and as they walked out, they made some snarky comments about the cafe being “overly strict.” I felt justified in what I said, but later my manager told me that I handled it poorly and could have approached the situation in a more professional manner.

I decided to have a small celebration with some close friends and invited Sam along, hoping we could have a good time together.

I tried to keep things positive and mentioned that I’d love to hear about their job search, but it felt like every time I tried to celebrate my success, Sam would turn it into a comparison or a negative comment about their own life.

At the celebration, I was in a great mood, and after a few drinks, I made a joke about how it was nice to finally be the “successful sibling.” It was meant in good fun, but it clearly hit a nerve. Sam snapped back, saying something like, ""Enjoy your moment while it lasts. You’re just one bad performance away from being back at square one."" The atmosphere turned awkward, and I felt really bad for bringing it up, but I also thought it was a bit unfair for them to rain on my parade.

Everyone sucks here,"To start, I need to share some context. I (32M) have a younger sister, Emma (25F), who has always been very vocal about her opinions and feelings. We grew up in a household where emotions were often expressed loudly, so it’s not unusual for us to have passionate discussions. However, lately, Emma has been going through a tough time in her personal life, and I’ve tried to be supportive.

Recently, Emma invited me to a gathering at her apartment, which was meant to be a fun evening with friends. I planned to go, but as the day approached, I started feeling overwhelmed with work stress. I really didn’t want to show up in a bad mood and ruin the atmosphere, so I decided to text her and let her know I wouldn’t make it.

The problem started when she called me, clearly upset. Rather than taking a moment to listen, I tried to explain my situation, but she interrupted me, insisting that I was being unsupportive and that she needed my presence. I snapped and told her that she was being “selfish” for trying to guilt-trip me into coming, especially when I had already communicated my feelings. I raised my voice and ended the call abruptly, feeling frustrated.

The next day, she texted me a long message, saying that I had hurt her deeply and that my response was unacceptable. I felt guilty and, in a moment of defensiveness, I replied with a sarcastic message about how she could “find other friends to support her” if I wasn’t good enough.

During our first game, we had a rough start. I was feeling off and not playing my best, while Jake was on fire and scoring left and right.

Whenever I’m working on a project, he feels the need to ""offer help,"" which often comes off as him trying to take over my tasks instead.

She’s been open about her anxiety and depression, and I try to be supportive. We often hang out, and I’ve been there for her through tough times. However, I’ve noticed that sometimes she can be a bit manipulative when it comes to our friendship.

Recently, I started dating someone new, Jessica (28F). Jessica is great, and things have been going well. I was really excited to introduce her to my friends, including Lisa. When I told Lisa about Jessica, she seemed happy for me at first, but then she started making passive-aggressive comments about how I wouldn't have time for her anymore. I tried to reassure her that I could balance both friendships, but it felt like Lisa was trying to guilt-trip me.

A week later, I invited both Lisa and Jessica to a small get-together at my place to hang out and get to know each other. Lisa showed up late, and when she did, she immediately started taking jabs at Jessica, making snarky remarks about her appearance and how she was dressed. It made the atmosphere awkward, and I could see Jessica getting uncomfortable.

I confronted Lisa about her comments, telling her that it wasn’t cool to put down my girlfriend like that. Lisa snapped back, saying she was just “trying to lighten the mood” and that I shouldn’t be so sensitive. I felt really torn because I wanted to defend Jessica but also didn’t want to escalate things with Lisa, who I've been friends with for years.

In the heat of the moment, I ended up yelling at Lisa, telling her that if she couldn’t be supportive, maybe she shouldn’t come around anymore. Lisa was visibly hurt and left in tears, and I felt guilty for how I handled it. After she left, I tried to console Jessica, but I could tell she was upset about the whole situation too.

Now I’m questioning whether I overreacted. Yes, Lisa’s comments were inappropriate, but maybe I could have approached the situation differently. AITA?",66,2724,0.89,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_61094,2023-11-17 00:00:00,ESH,2012,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I (30M) have a younger brother (25M) who has been struggling with his mental health for a while now. My parents are very supportive and have been trying to help him get the care he needs. Recently, he moved back in with them to focus on his recovery. I live in another city and don’t see him often, but I try to stay in touch.

A few weeks ago, I was visiting my parents and during dinner, my brother mentioned he was feeling very overwhelmed and stressed. I tried to lighten the mood by joking about how he should “just get over it” because we all have our problems. I thought it would be a way to bond with him, but he didn’t take it well and I could see he was upset. 

Later, we had a heated argument about it. He accused me of being insensitive and not understanding what he was going through, and I shot back that he needed to toughen up and stop using his mental health as an excuse. My parents ended up getting involved and tried to mediate, but it escalated and we both said hurtful things to each other.

Afterward, I felt bad for the way I reacted, and I know he was already in a fragile state. But at the same time, I felt like he was being overly dramatic and that I was just trying to encourage him to be stronger. Now, I'm not sure if I was out of line or if he overreacted. 

TLDR: I made a joke to my brother about his mental health struggle, he got upset, we argued, and I’m not sure if I was insensitive or if he was overreacting.",99,2254,0.64,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_27693,2021-08-19 00:00:00,ESH,1449,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I have been living with my sister for the past few months while we save up for our own place. My sister has a two-year-old daughter, and while we love her, it's been a bit chaotic living in the same space. 

Last week, my sister asked me to watch her daughter for a couple of hours while she ran some errands. I agreed, but I had planned to use that time to finish an important work project that was due soon. When my sister left, the toddler was in a good mood, but after about 30 minutes, she started getting fussy and wanted my attention. I tried to juggle keeping her entertained while also working, but it was tough.

After about an hour, I felt overwhelmed. I put the laptop aside and tried to play with her, but she was in a mood where she just wanted to run around and didn't want to sit still. I lost my patience and snapped at her a bit, telling her to be quiet so I could work. I felt bad immediately, but I was stressed about the deadline.

When my sister came home, she could tell something was off. I admitted that I struggled to keep her daughter entertained and that I snapped a little. My sister was upset with me for losing my patience and reminded me that I agreed to take care of her. I said I didn't sign up for a babysitting job, and it was unfair for her to expect me to handle everything while also working.

We ended up arguing about it, and she said I was being selfish for not prioritizing her daughter. I felt like I had valid concerns about my work, but I also knew I could have handled the situation better.

Everyone sucks here,"So a few days ago, I went out to dinner with a group of friends at this popular restaurant. We were all really excited to try the food, and the vibe was great. However, one of my friends, Jake, was being super rude to the waiter from the moment we sat down. He kept making sarcastic comments about the menu and rolling his eyes whenever the waiter came over. It was really uncomfortable, and I could tell that the waiter was trying his best to stay professional.

At some point during the meal, the waiter accidentally knocked over a glass of water on the table. It was a total accident, and he immediately apologized and offered to clean it up. Instead of being understanding, Jake started making a scene, yelling about how ""clumsy"" the waiter was and how ""he should be more careful"" in front of everyone. I thought it was completely uncalled for and said, ""Come on, man, it was an accident. Chill out."" 

Jake turned to me and snapped back, saying something like, ""You’re just as much of a pushover as he is."" I was shocked and felt embarrassed for both the waiter and my friend’s behavior. I know I shouldn't have said anything, and I could have just let it go, but I was fed up with how Jake was treating the waiter.

After that, the atmosphere got really tense, and I could tell my other friends were uncomfortable too. The waiter managed to laugh it off, but I could see he was visibly upset. As we were leaving, I overheard Jake talking to another friend, saying that he was going to leave a bad review for the restaurant because of the waiter. I felt like I should have done more to stand up for the waiter, but I didn't want to escalate things further.

Now I’m wondering if I crossed a line by calling out Jake in front of everyone, or if Jake was the one who really acted like an asshole. Should I have just kept quiet and let him continue being rude, or was it right to say something? Am I the asshole here?",844,2563,0.64,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_51228,2021-09-20 00:00:00,ESH,1919,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Last month, my best friend invited me to her wedding, which I was thrilled about. I have known her for years and was excited to celebrate this special day with her. However, I was not in a great financial position due to some unexpected medical bills that had piled up. 

The wedding was a destination event, and the costs for travel and accommodation were quite high. I contemplated declining the invitation because I didn't want to put any additional financial strain on myself, but I didn't want to let my friend down either. After some back-and-forth, I decided to go but realized I could only afford a really cheap hotel room and to take a bus instead of flying. 

When I arrived, my friend seemed disappointed that I didn't stay at the more expensive hotel where the wedding party was. I explained my situation, but she was still upset and told me that I could have spent more money if I really valued our friendship. This statement stung, especially after I made sacrifices to be there. 

In the days leading up to the wedding, I overheard her talking to her other friends, making jokes about how I was ""too broke"" to enjoy the weekend properly. I felt embarrassed and hurt, and I ended up venting to another mutual friend about how I felt. That friend then mentioned my feelings to my best friend, which caused a rift between us. 

At the wedding, there was some tension. I tried to enjoy myself, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that my friend was judging me. I ended up making a snarky comment about how not everyone can afford a lavish wedding, which only escalated things. She confronted me about it later, and we ended up arguing.

Now, I feel guilty for letting my financial situation impact our friendship, but I also think she shouldn't have made me feel ashamed for not spending more money. AITA?",780,1305,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_90562,2022-05-10 00:00:00,ESH,1817,AITA

He's rude, overbearing, and I felt like he didn't treat her well. I often voiced my concerns to her, but she always brushed them off, insisting that he was great and that I was just being protective.

One day, I found out that he was planning a surprise birthday party for her, and I thought it would be a disaster. I didn't want her to be disappointed or embarrassed by him, so I decided to intervene. I called her parents and told them about my concerns, hoping they would help her see the light.

When she found out what I did, she was furious. She accused me of overstepping and ruining her surprise. She said I should have trusted her to make her own decisions. I felt terrible but was convinced I was trying to protect her from someone who didn't deserve her.

At the same time, I realized that I might have been too controlling and that my actions could be seen as manipulative. I should have let her handle her own relationship, regardless of my feelings about him.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I (28F) have been friends with Sarah (27F) since college. We’ve been through a lot together, and I consider her one of my closest friends. Recently, Sarah started dating Mark (30M). They met online, and while I was happy for her, I noticed that Mark was a bit overbearing at times. 

One night, Sarah invited me over for dinner. When I arrived, Mark was already there, and he seemed kind of off. He’s always been a little possessive, but that night he was really on edge. After a while, we were chatting, and I made a light-hearted joke about how Sarah’s cooking was “so good I might just marry her.” Mark suddenly got super tense and snapped, saying something like, “You should know your place because I’m the one who’s with her now.” I was taken aback by his tone, but I tried to brush it off because I didn’t want to ruin the evening.

Later that night, after dinner, Sarah went to the kitchen to clean up, and Mark and I were left alone for a moment. I figured it was a good time to let him know that I found his comment inappropriate. I said something like, “Hey, I know you care about Sarah, but that was kind of rude.” He got defensive and accused me of trying to undermine him and trying to come between them. 

In the heat of the moment, I ended up saying that maybe he was just insecure because he knew Sarah had a close friend like me. That really set him off, and he started shouting about how I didn’t know anything about their relationship and that I should back off. 

When Sarah came back, she could see that things were tense, and I tried to explain what happened, but Mark interrupted and told her I was just trying to stir drama. I ended up getting frustrated and left, telling them both that they needed to figure out their issues together without dragging me into it.

A few days later, Sarah called me, clearly upset. She said that Mark had been hurt by our confrontation and that I should apologize. I told her that I felt I had a right to speak up about how he treated her and me, but she insisted that I was being the bad friend by not just letting it go. 

We ended up getting into a huge argument over the phone, and I said some harsh things that I regret, accusing her of letting him control her. I hung up feeling angry at both of them for not seeing my side.

Now, I’m feeling conflicted. I care about Sarah, but I can’t stand the way Mark treats her and how he treated me. I feel like I overstepped, but I also thought I was looking out for my friend.

Everyone sucks here,"Hello, I (29F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (30M) for about three years. We met through mutual friends and hit it off right away. I really appreciate his laid-back attitude, and he often encourages me to be more relaxed as I tend to be a bit of a control freak.

Recently, I decided to plan a surprise birthday party for him. I got together with his friends to organize everything, including food, drinks, and decorations. I thought it would be a great way to show him how much I care. However, I didn't consult him about the guest list because I wanted it to be a complete surprise, and I assumed he would appreciate it.

The party day came, and everything was going well until I noticed he seemed a bit off. When he arrived, I quickly realized that I had invited some people he wasn't on good terms with, including his ex and a friend who had made some rude comments about him in the past. I thought he would be able to handle it, but he looked visibly upset.

I tried to pull him aside and discuss how we could make the best of the situation, but he ended up getting frustrated and stormed out of the party. I felt terrible and tried to reach out to him afterward, but he was really angry and said I should’ve asked him first about the guest list.

In response to his anger, I snapped back and told him he was being ungrateful for all the effort I put into organizing the party. I felt like I was just trying to do something nice for him, and I didn’t understand why he couldn’t just enjoy the moment. It escalated into a big argument where we both said things we regretted.

After some time apart, I realized that I should have respected his feelings and asked for his input. I just wanted it to be a surprise, but I now see how that backfired. At the same time, I think he overreacted by getting so upset and not giving me a chance to make things right during the party.

At some point, a few of us started playing a game that involved some light teasing and joking around. It was all in good fun until I made a comment about one of my friends, Sarah, that I thought was harmless. I said something about how she always manages to burn her food whenever she cooks.

Sarah didn’t take it well and got visibly upset, saying it wasn't funny and that she was actually trying to improve her cooking skills. I immediately felt bad and tried to apologize, but she just walked away from the group. I was frustrated because I thought the comment was light-hearted and everyone else laughed.

Feeling defensive, I vented to another friend, Mark, saying that Sarah needed to lighten up and stop being so sensitive. Mark, however, said that I should be more considerate and that I crossed a line. I then snapped back that if Sarah couldn’t take a joke, that was her problem.

Later in the night, I overheard Sarah crying in the bathroom, and I felt guilty. I decided to check on her, and when I did, I kind of snapped at her saying that maybe she shouldn't take everything so seriously. That just made things worse, and she told me to leave her alone.

Everyone sucks here,"I think I might be an asshole for how I handled a situation with my roommate. 

We’ve been living together for about a year, and while we generally get along, we've had some friction over chores. My roommate is a nice guy, but he’s a bit messy and often leaves his dishes piled up in the sink for days. I’ve tried to be patient about it, but it’s been really frustrating for me because I like to keep the place tidy. 

Recently, I started noticing that my roommate was also using my cooking supplies without asking. I don’t mind sharing, but it would be nice if he’d at least check with me first. Last week, I came home to find that he had used my nice frying pan to cook something greasy and didn’t even bother to clean it properly. I lost my cool and sent him a text saying something like, “You’re so inconsiderate. Can’t you just clean up after yourself for once?”

He replied saying that I was overreacting and that he thought we were sharing everything. This made me feel even more irritated, so I ended up calling him a “slob” in a follow-up message. I felt bad afterward, but I was really angry at the time. 

To make things worse, when we had a face-to-face conversation about it, I just couldn't let it go. I accused him of being lazy and ungrateful, and he shot back that I was too uptight. We both ended up raising our voices, and it turned into a huge argument.

Everyone sucks here,"This is a throwaway account because I don't want my friends or family to find out about this situation. Recently, I (27 M) had a really tense confrontation with my best friend (28 M) at his birthday party.

To give some background, we've been friends since high school. Over the years, we’ve had a lot of fun and shared many experiences, but we’ve also had our fair share of arguments. This time, we were at a party he was hosting in his apartment, and a few of our close friends were there as well.

Earlier that week, my friend had confided in me about some struggles he was having with his girlfriend. He was feeling insecure because she had started hanging out with a new group of friends, and he thought they were a bad influence on her. I listened to him and offered my advice, but I felt he was being overly dramatic about the situation.

Fast forward to the birthday party. Throughout the night, I noticed he spent a lot of time checking his phone and looking worried. When I asked him what was wrong, he told me that his girlfriend was out with her new friends and he hadn’t heard from her. I tried to reassure him, but he seemed increasingly upset and dropped some comments that made it clear he was jealous.

In a moment of frustration, I jokingly said something like, “Dude, you really need to trust her. It’s not like she’s going to run off with some random guy just because you’re not with her.” It came off way harsher than I intended, and he snapped back, saying I didn't understand the situation and to stop downplaying his feelings.

I could feel the tension rising, and more guests started to notice. Instead of backing down, I pressed further, insisting he should just relax and enjoy his party. My tone was sarcastic, and I could see that I was crossing a line. He got really upset, and others started to defend him, saying that I was being a jerk for belittling his concerns. In that moment, I felt attacked and started raising my voice, saying that he needed to grow up and stop being so insecure.

The argument escalated to the point where he asked me to leave the party. I was furious and felt like I had a right to express my opinion, but I eventually left after some of our friends tried to mediate and it became clear there was no resolution. 

Afterwards, I felt bad for how things turned out but also thought my friend was being overly sensitive about the whole situation. Since then, we haven’t spoken much, and I feel like we’ve both contributed to this mess.

Sarah is really into cooking and loves experimenting with new recipes, which I think is great. But she tends to leave a huge mess in the kitchen afterward, and she doesn’t clean it up right away.

I’ve brought it up to her a couple of times, stating that I appreciate her culinary efforts but would really like her to clean up after herself immediately. She usually brushes it off, saying that she needs to let things cool down before she can clean, or that she’ll get to it later. But ""later"" often means the next day, and by then there are dirty dishes piled up, food splattered everywhere, and it becomes impossible for me to make my own meals.

After a particularly frustrating week of coming home to a messy kitchen, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I started leaving her mess untouched until she got around to cleaning it, which led to a more chaotic kitchen situation. I thought that if she had to navigate through the mess every time she wanted to cook, she might finally get the hint.

It only made things worse, though. She confronted me about it, saying I was being petty and that I should just clean up my own part and let her handle it. I responded by saying that it wasn’t fair that I had to clean up her mess when I had already asked her nicely multiple times to take care of it herself.

Everyone sucks here,"So I (39F) have two daughters, Emily (12F) and Sarah (9F). My husband, Dave (40M), and I try to keep our home filled with love and support, but things have been a bit tense lately.

Dave and I have always encouraged our girls to express themselves creatively, and they both love drawing and painting. Recently, Emily's art has really taken off. She's been participating in art competitions at school, and I’m proud of her talent. However, she has been getting quite competitive about it and has started to look down on Sarah's art, which is a lot more playful and whimsical. 

One day, Emily was working on a piece for a contest, and Sarah asked if she could join in and help. Emily snapped at her and told her she was a ""baby"" and that her art was ""stupid."" I overheard this and stepped in, telling Emily to apologize and be more supportive of her sister. Emily reluctantly did so but made it clear she didn’t mean it. 

Later, I tried talking to Emily about how important it is to encourage each other as sisters and how her words can hurt Sarah. Instead of being receptive, she rolled her eyes and said she didn’t care about Sarah's art. Feeling frustrated, I told her that she needed to tone down her competitive attitude and remember that art is supposed to be fun, not just about winning.

At this point, I felt like I was overstepping. So, I decided to take action and told both girls they would have to work together on a joint art project for the upcoming family art night. Emily was furious and argued that it was unfair to make her work with someone who “didn’t even know how to draw.” Sarah was excited about it, but I could see Emily was unhappy.

When the project started, it quickly turned into an argument, with Emily criticizing Sarah’s ideas and Sarah getting upset and shutting down. I tried to mediate, but it ended up escalating to a full-blown fight with both girls shouting at each other. I lost my cool and yelled that they both needed to grow up and stop acting like children. 

After the dust settled, I felt guilty. I know that I shouldn’t have yelled and I should have found a better way to handle their conflict. But I also felt like Emily needed a wake-up call about her behavior and that she was being unfair to Sarah.

Now, they’re both upset with me, and I can’t help but think I might have overreacted. I just wanted them to learn to support each other, but I ended up making things worse. AITA?",934,2173,0.76,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_74619,2018-06-22 00:00:00,ESH,2429,AITA

My friend (22F) and I (21F) have been close for a few years. We often go out together and share a lot of mutual friends. Recently, I invited her to a weekend trip to the beach with a group of friends. She was excited and agreed to come.

A few days before the trip, she mentioned that her parents were having some issues and that she might have to cancel. I understood and told her that it was okay if she needed to stay back to support her family. But she decided to come after all, saying she needed a break.

When we got to the beach, I noticed she was a bit distant and seemed off. I tried to include her in activities and get her to relax, but she kept withdrawing. I was worried about her and asked if she wanted to talk about what was bothering her. Instead of opening up, she snapped at me, saying I was being too pushy and not letting her enjoy her vacation.

Feeling hurt, I decided to step back and let her have her space. However, the rest of the group started to notice the tension between us and began asking what was wrong. I told them, and they sided with me, saying I was just trying to help her. This only made her more upset, and she ended up leaving the group for most of the trip.

By the end of the weekend, we got into a big argument about everything. I told her that I felt like she was dismissing my concern for her, and she accused me of only caring about how she was affecting my vacation.

Everyone sucks here,"Ever since my sister Sarah (28F) moved back in with me (30M) after her divorce, things have been tense. She got a puppy, Charlie, who has been an absolute handful. While I love dogs, I didn't expect to be suddenly taking care of a hyperactive puppy while still trying to manage my job and personal life.

The first few weeks were chaotic. Charlie chewed up my shoes, barked at all hours, and left little surprises around the house. I tried to be understanding, knowing Sarah was going through a lot, but my patience wore thin when I came home one day to find the kitchen trash all over the floor because Sarah forgot to close the lid. I lost my temper and snapped at her about how I couldn't handle the mess, especially since I was the one cleaning it up.

Sarah got defensive and reminded me that she was dealing with a lot right now. She said she was trying her best to train Charlie but that it was a process. I acknowledged that but told her that I felt like I was the one who was having to take on the responsibility of the puppy. We ended up yelling at each other, and I said some hurtful things about her choices that led to her being alone and how she didn’t seem to care about my space.

A few days later, I came home to find that Sarah had invited a couple of her friends over, and they were all in the living room playing with Charlie. The house was a mess again, and I felt like I was living in a dog daycare. When I expressed my frustration, her friends jumped in defensively, saying I should be more supportive and that it was just a dog. At that point, I snapped again and told them that my home wasn’t a playground.

After they left, Sarah and I had another argument. She accused me of being unsupportive during a tough time and said I didn’t care about her or Charlie. I retorted that I felt like I was being taken for granted and that I needed my space and some respect in my own home. We both said things we didn't mean, and it ended with her storming off to her room.

Now we’re both feeling hurt and angry with each other. I realize that I could have been more patient and supportive, but at the same time, I feel like she has been inconsiderate of my feelings and my space, especially after I’ve been accommodating for so long.

Our parents are getting older and have been relying more on us for support, which is understandable. However, my sister has been handling their finances and has been very controlling about how money is spent. 

One day, I noticed some expenses that seemed unnecessary, like a subscription service they didn’t use much. I brought it up to her, suggesting we should have a family meeting to discuss their budget and see if there are ways to save. She completely blew up at me, saying I had no idea what I was talking about and that she was doing the best she could. 

In the heat of the moment, I said some pretty harsh things, like accusing her of trying to control everything and not considering our parents' needs. I regret it now, but it felt like she was dismissing my concerns and acting superior. 

After our argument, I felt bad, but I also think she was being unreasonable. We both care about our parents, but we clearly handle things differently.

I was still in bed, trying to enjoy my weekend sleep. After a while, the noise started to wake me up, and I asked my partner if they could be a bit quieter because I was really tired and wanted to sleep longer.

My friend Jake and I were sitting with a group of classmates, and there was some light-hearted banter going on. At one point, I made a joke about how Jake has a habit of overreacting to everything, saying something like, “Jake would cry if a butterfly landed on his shoulder!” Everyone laughed, but Jake took it really hard. 

He started getting defensive and said I was being a jerk, which surprised me because it was all in good fun. I tried to explain that it was just a joke, but he kept insisting that I was being mean and that I should apologize. I felt frustrated because it seemed like he was overreacting, and I didn’t think I had done anything wrong. Instead of backing down, I pushed back a bit, saying he needed to lighten up and not take everything so seriously.

Then, another friend, Lisa, jumped in and said that I should apologize because jokes can hurt people even if they’re meant to be funny. I felt ganged up on, so I shot back with, “Well, maybe if everyone wasn’t so sensitive, we could actually enjoy being funny!” This, of course, made the situation worse, and Jake ended up storming off, visibly upset.

The next day, Jake told me he was really hurt by what I said and that it made him feel bad about himself. I felt bad that he took it that way, but I still believed it was just a joke. I ended up apologizing, but I was also annoyed because I felt like he was being too sensitive. Lisa later told me that I could have handled it better and that we both contributed to the mess.

Now, I’m stuck feeling like maybe I was too harsh on Jake, but also that he shouldn’t have blown it out of proportion. I’m wondering if I was really at fault, or if we both just handled things poorly. Was I the jerk for trying to defend my sense of humor, or was Jake overreacting?

We were having a good time, laughing and joking around, and the drinks were flowing. At one point, I noticed that my roommate was getting a bit too loud and overly critical of the other players. 

As the night progressed, she started making fun of one of our friends, who had a reputation for being a bit clumsy. She joked about how he should ""just give up on life"" when he accidentally knocked over a stack of cards. I thought it was pretty harsh and tried to deflect by saying, ""Come on, it's just a game, let's not be too mean."" 

That only seemed to encourage her, and she continued with the jabs. Frustrated, I snapped back, ""It’s not like you’re any better at this game; you’ve lost three times in a row!"" It turned into a small argument where we both ended up being rude towards each other. 

After that, the mood of the night shifted. Our friends were visibly uncomfortable, and the fun atmosphere dissipated. We ended up ignoring each other for the rest of the night, and I could tell that our friends were caught in the middle of our conflict.

Everyone sucks here,"So backstory:

I (24F) have a close-knit group of friends, and we often hang out together. One of my friends, Sarah (25F), has recently been going through a rough patch after a breakup. She’s been really emotional and very sensitive about everything. I’ve tried to be supportive, but honestly, it’s been exhausting.

Last week, while we were at a gathering, Sarah started talking about her ex and how he was a terrible person. I tried to lighten the mood by joking about how we should all just let loose and have fun instead of dwelling on the past. I didn’t mean anything by it, but she snapped at me, saying I was being insensitive and dismissive of her feelings.

To be fair, I was a little irritated by her constant negativity, so I shot back and said that she needed to get over it and stop acting like the world was ending. The atmosphere got really tense, and some of our friends were uncomfortable. After that, Sarah left the gathering in tears.

Later, I felt bad for how I handled it and tried to reach out to apologize, but she ignored my texts. Then, our mutual friend, Jake (26M), got involved. He told me that I was being an unsupportive friend and that I should have just listened to her instead of trying to make jokes. I got defensive and told him that Sarah should have been more understanding of my feelings too.

Now I feel like I might have gone too far with my comments, and I regret how it all turned out. But I also think Jake shouldn’t have intervened in the way he did.

My best friend, Mia, who’s 30, has always been supportive but tends to make insensitive comments when it comes to mental health.

Recently, I opened up to her about feeling particularly overwhelmed and how I was considering seeking therapy again. Instead of being supportive, she made a comment about how “everyone has problems” and that “some people just need to toughen up.” I felt hurt and invalidated, especially since I had always been there for her during her own tough times.

A few days later, Mia invited me to a gathering at her place with a bunch of mutual friends. I was hesitant to go because I was still feeling pretty low, but I thought it might help me feel better. When I arrived, I noticed that Mia was being her usual self—loud and the center of attention. At one point, she started making jokes about mental health in a lighthearted way, which made me uncomfortable. 

I snapped and told her that her jokes were inappropriate and that she didn’t understand what it was like to deal with real struggles.

So, my best friend and I have known each other since middle school. We’ve always been really close, but there’s always been a little bit of a competitive edge between us, especially when it comes to our careers. We both work in the same field, and we’ve both faced our share of ups and downs.

Recently, I got a promotion at work that I had been gunning for. I was thrilled and really wanted to celebrate, so I invited my friend out for dinner to share my news. During dinner, I was talking about how grateful I was for the opportunity and how excited I was to take on new responsibilities. However, it seemed like my friend wasn’t really engaging with me; she was kind of dismissive and kept checking her phone.

After a while, I asked her if everything was okay, and she said she was just feeling a little down about her own job situation. I could tell she was upset, but instead of being supportive, I ended up saying something like, “Well, you know, sometimes you have to put in more effort if you want to get ahead.” It came out a lot harsher than I intended, and she got really defensive. 

She ended up snapping back that I didn’t know what it was like to struggle because I had just gotten this promotion handed to me and that it was easy for me to say. I felt hurt because I’ve worked really hard for this, and I didn’t mean to dismiss her feelings. We ended up leaving the restaurant on a pretty sour note.

We haven’t talked much since then, and I keep replaying the whole situation in my head.

During the party, Jake decided to play one of those classic party games that usually involves some degree of embarrassment. He set up an impromptu ""truth or dare"" session, and at first, it was all light-hearted. As the night wore on, though, things got a bit out of hand.

This escalated into an argument where I told him he needed to respect his girlfriend's feelings, and he shot back that I was just being a buzzkill.

Maya, caught in the middle, tried to defuse the situation by saying it was fine and that she was okay with the game. But it was clear she was trying to keep the peace, which made me feel even worse.

Jake has this habit of being late to everything. I mean, it’s kind of his thing. We’d joke about it, but it’s getting to the point where it’s really annoying.

Jake texted me at 6:45 PM saying he was “on his way,” but I knew that meant he wouldn’t show up until at least 8 PM. Sure enough, he rolled in at 8:15 PM, and I was already feeling frustrated.

When he arrived, I confronted him about his tardiness. I wasn't rude at first; I just expressed how disrespectful it feels to wait around. But Jake shrugged it off and said, “I’m busy, man. It’s not a big deal.” That really ticked me off, and I snapped, telling him it was inconsiderate and that he needs to start respecting other people’s time. I ended up raising my voice, and he got defensive, saying I was overreacting and that I'm just being uptight.

I tried to bring it up casually, but she just brushed it off and said she was busy and would get to it later.

After a particularly long day at work, I snapped and confronted her about it. I raised my voice and told her that living in a pigsty was unacceptable and that I was tired of cleaning up after her. She got defensive and accused me of being overly uptight and not understanding her struggles.

In the heat of the moment, I said some pretty hurtful things, like how she clearly couldn’t manage her life and that I regretted living with her. She ended up crying and locked herself in her room. I felt terrible afterward, but I also think she needed a wake-up call about being a responsible adult.

Now, we’re not talking, and the tension is unbearable. I feel guilty for how I reacted, but at the same time, I think she needs to take responsibility for her mess.

Everyone sucks here,"I’m a 28-year-old guy, and I’ve been dating my girlfriend, who is 27, for about two years. She has a younger brother, Jake, who just turned 18 and graduated high school. Jake is a really smart kid, but he can be pretty self-centered and immature, often acting like the world revolves around him.

Recently, my girlfriend and I hosted a small graduation party for him at our apartment, inviting family and a few close friends. I had spent a lot of time planning the food and decorations because I wanted it to be special for Jake. However, when Jake arrived, he barely acknowledged anything we did and immediately started talking about his plans to take a gap year and travel.

As the night went on, he kept bringing the conversation back to himself and his future, which honestly felt a bit rude given that it was supposed to be a celebration for him. At one point, I tried to redirect the conversation by sharing a funny story from my own graduation, but he interrupted me and just kept talking about his travel plans as if no one else was there.

Frustrated, I called him out in front of everyone, saying something like, ""This is your graduation party, but it feels like it's more about you than any of us."" The room went silent, and he looked really hurt. My girlfriend shot me a look, and after the party, she told me I was out of line for embarrassing him, saying he was just excited about his future. 

I felt bad because I didn’t mean to hurt his feelings, but I also think it was important for him to realize that other people were there to celebrate with him, not just listen to him talk about himself. Now, my girlfriend is upset with me, and Jake hasn’t spoken to me since. So, AITA?",357,2582,0.57,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_62195,2024-07-08 00:00:00,ESH,1694,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I want to share a situation that happened recently with my roommate, and I’m trying to figure out if I was in the wrong. My roommate and I have been living together for about a year, and while we generally get along, there have been a few tensions lately.

I work from home, and I have a pretty rigorous schedule. I try to keep my workspace organized and quiet because I have conference calls and need to stay focused. My roommate, on the other hand, works an irregular job with varying hours and tends to be more laid-back about noise and mess.

A few weeks ago, my roommate had a few friends over on a weekday afternoon while I was in the middle of an important meeting. They were being really loud and it completely threw me off. I asked them to keep it down politely, but they just laughed it off. After the meeting, I confronted my roommate about it, saying that it was really inconsiderate of him, especially since I had to work.

He apologized but said he thought it’d be fine since it was his day off and I should just find a way to deal with it. I was frustrated, but I let it go, thinking maybe I overreacted a bit.

Fast forward to last week, I had planned a small get-together with some friends on a Friday night. I made sure to keep the noise down since I knew he’d be home from work. However, he ended up being really annoyed with me for not inviting him. He seemed to think it wasn’t fair that I could have friends over but he couldn’t join in.

In the heat of the moment, I snapped and told him that if he had any consideration for my work schedule, I wouldn’t have to keep everything so quiet. I felt bad afterward, and he ended up storming off to his room.

Now, I can’t shake the feeling that I was being unfair to him, but at the same time, I think he was being disrespectful to my work. Am I the asshole here?",304,2211,0.88,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_76944,2019-12-16 00:00:00,ESH,1830,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I (29F) recently had a falling out with my best friend, Lisa (30F). We’ve been close since college, but things have changed a lot since then. Lisa has been in a serious relationship with her boyfriend for over a year, and it seems like she’s completely forgotten about the rest of her life. I understand that relationships can take up a lot of time, but she’s been neglecting our friendship in a big way. 

I tried talking to her about it, but she brushed me off, saying I was being selfish and needed to be more understanding. Frustrated, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I organized a girls' night out with our mutual friends and didn’t invite Lisa. I thought it would show her how much we missed her and hopefully make her realize she was neglecting her friendships.

When Lisa found out, she was furious. She confronted me and accused me of trying to sabotage her relationship. I told her I just wanted to have some fun with our friends and that she needed to learn that friendships matter too. It ended up escalating into a big argument where we both said things we didn’t mean. 

In the heat of the moment, I even called her “just a girlfriend now, not my best friend,” which I regret. She doesn’t want to talk to me now, and I feel awful for how everything turned out. I thought I was standing up for our friendship, but I ended up hurting her instead.

Everyone sucks here,"Last month, I hosted a small gathering for my friends to celebrate my birthday. I invited my close group of friends, including my best friend, Sarah, who I’ve known for over a decade. Sarah has been going through a rough patch lately—she lost her job and has been struggling with her mental health. I wanted to make sure she felt included and supported during the celebration.

As the night went on, we were all having a great time, laughing and joking around. I had planned a little toast to express my gratitude for my friends, and when it was time, I raised my glass. However, just as I started to speak, Sarah interrupted me and began ranting about how she felt like a failure for not being where she thought she would be in life. She got quite loud and emotional, and I could see that other friends were uncomfortable. 

I tried to redirect the conversation, gently suggesting we could talk about it later, but she continued to vent. Eventually, I snapped and told her that this was supposed to be a happy occasion, and it wasn’t fair to bring down the mood. I told her that she needed to check her emotions at the door sometimes and that not everything had to revolve around her struggles. 

The atmosphere in the room shifted immediately. Some friends looked shocked, while others awkwardly glanced at each other. Sarah’s expression went from upset to hurt, and she left the gathering in tears. I felt bad that I had lost my temper, but I also felt frustrated that she couldn’t see how her behavior was affecting everyone else.

The next day, I reached out to her to apologize for my harshness, but she hasn’t responded. A mutual friend told me that Sarah felt betrayed and abandoned by me.

Everyone sucks here,"I work at a small coffee shop, and I've been there for about a year. It's a tight-knit community, and everyone is usually friendly. One day, a regular customer, let's call her Sarah, came in with a couple of friends. Sarah is known for being a bit demanding, but I've always tried to accommodate her requests.

This particular day, she ordered a complicated drink that involved several modifications. I took her order and did my best to make it exactly how she wanted it. When the drink was ready, she didn't seem satisfied and sent it back, asking for another version. I made the second drink, and once again, she sent it back, claiming it wasn't right. At this point, I was feeling stressed, especially since the shop was busy, and I had other customers to attend to.

After the third attempt, I felt frustrated and snapped a little. I told her that I was doing my best but that I couldn’t keep remaking drinks indefinitely. She responded with a huff, saying she was just trying to get her order right and that I was being rude. I could feel the tension in the air, and other customers started to notice.

Meanwhile, Sarah's friends were also getting annoyed by the wait and started chiming in, criticizing my service. Feeling cornered, I decided to make one last drink and handed it to Sarah, but I did so with an eye roll, which I know was unprofessional. She took it but looked visibly upset, and I overheard her telling her friends she wouldn't be coming back because of me.

Later that day, I found out that Sarah had posted a negative review about me online, and my manager called me in to discuss the situation. It was a tough conversation, and I felt guilty for how I handled the situation, but I also felt that Sarah could have been a bit more understanding as well. 

So, AITA for snapping at a demanding customer after multiple attempts to get her order right?",383,2010,0.7,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_50880,2022-11-16 00:00:00,ESH,1873,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"This is a throwaway account as I'm concerned about the judgment I'll receive.

Backstory: I'm a 30-year-old woman, and I have a younger brother, Jake, who is 22. Growing up, we were close, but our relationship has been strained since he graduated high school. Jake has always been somewhat aimless; he struggled to find a job after graduation and decided to take a gap year. That year turned into two, and he’s still living with our parents without contributing financially or looking for work.

My parents have been incredibly patient, giving him plenty of time to figure things out. They’ve tried to help him with job applications and even paid for a few courses he showed interest in. Unfortunately, Jake rarely follows through, and it’s begun to take a toll on my parents' mental health. They’re exhausted and frustrated, and I can see how it’s affecting their relationship.

Recently, I visited my parents and noticed how overwhelmed they were. I had a long conversation with Jake where I expressed my concern for him and urged him to find a job or at least take some responsibility. He brushed me off, saying he was ""still figuring things out."" I lost my temper and said some harsh things, including that he was wasting his life and that he needed to grow up.

Feeling guilty afterward, I decided to confront my parents about the situation. I suggested that they draw a line in the sand and set a deadline for Jake to start contributing or move out. They were hesitant but eventually agreed to set a three-month deadline, hoping it would motivate him. 

I thought I was doing the right thing for my family, but things quickly escalated. When Jake found out about our conversation, he was furious. He accused me of betraying him and not supporting him when he needed it most. In turn, I felt angry with him for not taking responsibility and for blaming me for the situation.

Now there's a rift between all of us. My parents are torn; they want to support Jake but also don’t want to enable him. Jake is refusing to talk to me, saying I don’t understand what he’s going through. I feel like I was trying to help, but it seems I only made everything worse.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I (28M) have a close group of friends, and we’ve been hanging out together for years. Recently, one of my friends, Jake (30M), started dating someone new, Lisa (27F). We were all excited for him, and we welcomed her into our friend group.

A few weeks into their relationship, I noticed that Lisa and I were getting along really well. We’d laugh and joke around during our hangouts, and we even had a few deep conversations about personal stuff. I didn’t think anything of it at first, but I could sense Jake was becoming a bit uncomfortable with how close we were becoming.

One night, we were all out celebrating Jake’s birthday, and after a few drinks, Lisa jokingly suggested we take a selfie together. Jake was sitting right next to us, and I thought it was harmless, so I agreed. We ended up taking a silly photo, and Lisa posted it on her social media with a caption about how much fun we were having. Jake seemed annoyed and made a comment about how it was ""just a little too cozy.""

The next day, Jake confronted me about it. He said he felt disrespected because Lisa was his girlfriend and he didn’t like how touchy we were in the photo. I thought he was overreacting, but I apologized because I didn’t want to create tension in our friend group. However, I still felt that he was being overly possessive.

Later that week, I invited Lisa separately to grab coffee. We chatted about everything, and I mentioned how I felt bad about Jake being upset. Lisa said she thought Jake was being ridiculous and that it was just harmless fun. I agreed, and we ended up laughing about it.

Eventually, Jake found out about our coffee meetup and accused me of trying to steal his girlfriend. I was frustrated because I felt like I was just being friendly and supportive. We ended up having a big argument where I told him he was being insecure and controlling. He called me an asshole for not respecting his relationship.

In the heat of the moment, I told him maybe he should just lighten up and trust Lisa more. He stormed off, and now our whole friend group is divided. Some think I was in the right for being friendly, while others think I was way out of line for encouraging his girlfriend's behavior.

Everyone sucks here,"I've been friends with my best friend, Sarah, for over a decade. We’ve shared everything and been through thick and thin together. Recently, Sarah started dating a guy named Jake, and things moved pretty quickly—they went from casual dating to almost living together in just a few months. I was supportive at first, but as time went on, I started noticing some red flags about Jake.

For one, he seems to control a lot of what Sarah does. She used to love going out with friends or hanging out with us, but now she rarely makes plans without him. I also overheard a conversation where he told her she shouldn't hang out with certain friends because they ""don't have her best interests at heart."" That really got me worried, and I couldn’t just sit back and watch my best friend lose herself in a relationship.

So, I decided to bring it up to her. I approached her gently, trying to express my concerns without sounding too accusatory. I said something like, ""Hey, I’ve noticed you’ve been spending less time with us, and I just want to make sure you’re happy."" She got defensive and accused me of trying to sabotage her relationship. I was shocked and hurt; I was only looking out for her. 

In a moment of frustration, I ended up messaging Jake directly, telling him I think he’s too controlling and that he should let Sarah have her independence. I thought I was standing up for my friend, but it backfired massively. He confronted Sarah about it, and she was furious with me for overstepping boundaries and making things worse. Now, our friendship is strained, and I feel guilty for going behind her back like that.

I was hurt because I had already put effort into planning the details with her.

I thought it would make her understand how she made me feel, but it only caused more drama.

Background: My friend Sarah (25F) and I (26F) have been close since college. We share a tight-knit friend group and often hang out together. Sarah has always been a bit of a social butterfly, while I've tended to be more introverted. Recently, she started dating Tom (27M), a guy from our circle. Tom is charming and outgoing, and at first, I thought they made a great couple.

However, I've noticed something troubling about Tom. He has a history of being disrespectful to women; he often makes offhand comments that belittle them or treat them as less than. While I thought it was just a phase in their relationship, it became clear that he was starting to influence Sarah. She seemed to become more insecure, often seeking his approval for even the smallest decisions. This concerned me, but I didn't want to overstep since it's her relationship.

One night, while hanging out with a few friends, Tom made a particularly rude joke at Sarah's expense. He laughed, and the group chuckled, but Sarah looked visibly hurt. After everyone left, I confronted Tom about it. I told him that his humor was crossing a line and that he needed to be more respectful towards Sarah. He got defensive and claimed I was being overly sensitive.

I felt justified, but then I made a mistake. Instead of keeping my concerns private, I told our mutual friend Mike (24M) about the situation, insisting that we needed to look out for Sarah and how Tom was treating her. I told Mike to bring it up casually to Sarah, thinking it might help her realize what was happening.

Unfortunately, Mike took it upon himself to confront Tom directly about my concerns. This led to a huge blow-up, where Tom accused me of trying to ruin his relationship and Sarah of being too weak to stand up for herself. Sarah ended up caught in the middle, and it strained our friendship. She felt betrayed that I had talked about her relationship instead of addressing her directly. 

Looking back, I realize that I overstepped by involving Mike when I should have approached Sarah myself. I thought I was being a good friend by trying to protect her, but now it feels like I made everything worse.

It started when our parents decided to sell the family home, which held a lot of sentimental value for both of us. I felt Anna was being unreasonable about the sale and was more focused on the property's financial potential than the memories associated with it. Our arguments escalated, and we ended up not speaking for almost two years.

When I found out, I was furious and felt betrayed. I confronted Anna, and things got heated. I told her she was crossing a line and should have at least talked to me about it before getting involved with someone from my partner’s family. She argued that I was being childish and that I had no right to dictate her love life just because we were having issues.

Things got messy when Mark and Jake decided to host a family gathering. I felt really uncomfortable and upset about the situation but didn’t want to ruin the event for everyone else. I went, and while I tried to ignore Anna, it was impossible not to interact with her.

Everyone sucks here,"This happened a few weeks ago. I have a younger cousin, Jake, who is 15 and has been struggling with school for a while. He has ADHD and has always had trouble focusing. My aunt and uncle have been really supportive, but I noticed that they sometimes coddle him too much, which I think is holding him back.

During a family gathering, Jake was talking about how he flunked a math test, and my aunt was comforting him, saying it's okay and that he just needs to try harder. I’ve always been more straightforward, so I jumped in and said, ""Maybe if you actually paid attention in class instead of zoning out, you wouldn’t have these problems."" 

Jake got visibly upset, and my aunt shot me a dirty look, but I thought I was just being honest. I also added that he needs to take responsibility for his own learning instead of relying on everyone to hold his hand. The mood shifted, and my uncle started defending Jake, saying that I was being too harsh and insensitive.

Later, after everyone calmed down, Jake confronted me about what I said. He told me it hurt his feelings, and I tried to explain that I only wanted to motivate him, but he ended up crying and calling me a jerk. I felt bad, but I still believe I had a point.

Everyone sucks here,"My friend and I have a long-standing tradition of going out for brunch every Saturday. It's something we both look forward to, and we've made it a point to catch up on our lives over pancakes and coffee. However, recently, she started bringing her new boyfriend along without asking me first. At first, I was okay with it because I thought it was nice for her to want to include him in our routine. 

Over the past few weeks, though, I noticed that the dynamic changed a lot. During brunch, she would focus more on him than on our conversations, often sharing inside jokes or stories that I wasn't part of. It felt like I was an outsider in something that used to be our special time. I tried to be understanding, but it was frustrating to watch her prioritize him over our friendship.

Last week, I finally brought it up. I told her that I felt like our brunches had turned into a hangout for her and her boyfriend instead of quality time for us. I suggested that maybe we could have a few brunches just the two of us to reconnect, and she got defensive. She said I was being selfish and that she was just trying to share something enjoyable with me. I ended up snapping and saying something like, “If you want to spend time with him so badly, why not just go out with him instead of dragging me along?”

She got really upset and left the table. I felt bad about how I handled it, but I also felt like my feelings were valid. Now I'm caught in this awkward situation where our brunch tradition is strained, and I don't know if I overreacted or if she really is being inconsiderate.

Everyone sucks here,"Last year, I rented a small apartment with my friend, Jess. We both agreed to split the rent, which was $1,200 a month, so we were each responsible for $600. We had known each other for a few years, so I didn’t think there would be any issues. The apartment was nice, but it was a bit cramped since it was only two bedrooms and we both had a lot of stuff.

After living together for about six months, Jess started dating someone seriously, and he would come over almost every day. It didn’t bother me at first, but soon, he was practically living there. I voiced my concerns to Jess about how it felt like I was living with both of them, especially since the common spaces were getting crowded and I was paying the same amount as before.

Jess brushed it off, saying it was just temporary and that I should be more understanding because they were in love. I figured it wouldn’t be long-term, so I tried to be flexible. However, as time went on, I started feeling uncomfortable about the situation. It felt like her boyfriend was taking over, and I was just an unwelcome guest in my own apartment.

Eventually, I brought it up again, suggesting that if they were going to have him over all the time, maybe I should pay a little less rent—perhaps $500 instead of $600 since I was losing some of my living space. Jess got really defensive and accused me of being selfish and not supportive of her relationship. I didn’t think it was unreasonable, but I could sense the tension building.

In response, to try to make the situation better, I agreed to host a small dinner party for Jess and her boyfriend, hoping it would help ease my annoyance and show I was trying to be a good roommate. But then Jess invited more friends without asking me, turning the dinner into a bigger event that felt overwhelming. I ended up feeling resentful because it felt like my space was being taken over even more.

After that night, I decided to stop trying to accommodate her. I started coming home later, spending time out with friends to avoid the awkwardness. Jess noticed and confronted me, saying I had become distant and that I was being rude. I told her I was just trying to manage my own feelings about the situation. It turned into an argument where we both ended up saying hurtful things.

Now, I’m stuck not knowing if I should apologize for my behavior or if she should understand my perspective. We both seem to have crossed boundaries, and our friendship feels strained. 

So, am I the asshole for wanting to renegotiate the rent or for how I handled the situation, or is Jess being unreasonable too?",854,1287,0.73,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_84267,2022-06-13 00:00:00,ESH,2594,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My friends and I (all in our late 20s) have a tradition of going on a weekend camping trip every year. This year, we decided to rent a cabin to avoid the hassle of setting up tents and dealing with the weather. Before the trip, we discussed how we would split the costs and agreed that everyone would pay their share for the cabin and food.

When we got to the cabin, I noticed one of my friends, Mark, brought a ton of extra snacks and drinks that he didn't mention beforehand. While they looked great, they were clearly more than anyone else had brought. He then casually mentioned that he expected everyone to chip in for these extras since he had already paid for them. I felt a bit frustrated because our agreement was for the basics, not a full buffet.

In the moment, I joked that we should charge him a ""snack tax"" for his excessive haul. It was meant to be light-hearted, but it didn’t land that way. Mark took it the wrong way and got defensive, saying that a little extra shouldn’t be a big deal. I ended up saying he was being a bit over the top for expecting us to pay for snacks we didn’t even ask for, which escalated into a heated argument.

After that, the mood was pretty tense for the rest of the trip. My other friends felt caught in the middle, as they liked both of us and didn’t want to choose sides. Looking back, I realize I might have been too harsh with my comments, and Mark could have been more upfront about his plans for the snacks instead of assuming we would all be okay with it. 

Am I the asshole for how I handled the situation, or did Mark overreact?",94,2261,0.58,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_34085,2023-04-03 00:00:00,ESH,1587,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, I (28F) have a younger sister, Mia (25F), who has been dating her boyfriend, Jake, for about a year. I’ve always been protective of Mia, and while I’m generally supportive of her relationships, I’ve never been a fan of Jake. He comes off as self-centered and doesn’t seem to treat her as well as I think she deserves.

Last month, Mia invited me to a birthday dinner for Jake. I didn’t particularly want to go, but I felt it was important to support her, so I agreed. When we got there, I was surprised to see how over-the-top everything was, considering Jake's pretty average job. It felt like he was trying too hard to impress everyone and was the center of attention the whole time, which was annoying.

As the night went on, Jake started bragging about his accomplishments and making some questionable jokes that made me uncomfortable. At one point, he made a joke at Mia’s expense, which I thought was rude. I couldn’t help myself and called him out, saying that he should show more respect to her, especially on his birthday. This led to an awkward silence, and Mia looked visibly upset.

After the dinner, Mia confronted me and said I embarrassed her and ruined the night for Jake. I told her I was just trying to look out for her and that I didn’t mean to ruin anything. She insisted that I should have just kept my mouth shut. I felt bad but also felt justified in defending her.

Now, I’m feeling conflicted. Maybe I overstepped, but I was trying to protect my sister. AITA?",407,2191,0.86,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_11823,2023-01-01 00:00:00,ESH,1488,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Hi everyone, I could really use some outside perspective on this situation.

I’m a 28-year-old guy, and for this post, I'll refer to my girlfriend as Sarah. We’ve been dating for about a year, and we often hang out with a close group of friends. Recently, we decided to host a game night at our apartment, inviting a few friends over.

On the night of the gathering, everything was going smoothly. We had snacks, drinks, and everyone was in good spirits. As the night wore on, I noticed that Sarah had been acting a bit distant. I tried to engage her in conversation, but she seemed preoccupied and wasn’t really participating in the activities.

At one point, I jokingly asked her if she was okay and if she was having fun. Instead of laughing it off, she snapped at me, saying that I was being annoying and that she just wanted to chill. I was taken aback by her reaction, especially in front of our friends, and I felt embarrassed. 

Later in the evening, while we were playing a game, Sarah accidentally knocked over a drink, spilling it all over the table. Instead of helping clean it up, I made a sarcastic joke about her being clumsy. It was all in good fun, but she shot me a look that said she was really upset. I didn’t think it was that big of a deal, but I could see she was getting more annoyed.

After our friends left, Sarah confronted me about how I treated her during the night. She told me that I embarrassed her in front of everyone and that my jokes were really hurtful, especially when she was already feeling off. I, on the other hand, felt that she was overreacting to a few light-hearted comments and didn’t see why she couldn’t just relax and enjoy the night.

We ended up having a pretty heated argument, both of us saying things we didn’t mean. I told her she was being too sensitive and she called me inconsiderate. Now I’m left wondering if I was the jerk for making those jokes or if she was being overly dramatic about it all.

So, AITA for joking around with my girlfriend in front of friends while she was feeling off, or did she overreact?",249,2862,0.94,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_66583,2023-04-01 00:00:00,ESH,2073,AITA

I’m happy for her, but I also have to admit that I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed by the amount of attention her wedding plans are getting from our family. 

I’ve been struggling with my own personal issues, including a recent job loss and some health problems, and it’s been hard to keep my spirits up when I feel like I’m constantly sidelined in family conversations. Whenever we get together, my sister brings up her wedding plans, and I feel like I can’t share anything about what I’m going through without it being brushed aside. 

Last weekend, we had a family dinner, and as usual, the conversation quickly turned to her wedding. I snapped and said something like, “Can we talk about something else for once? Not everything has to be about your wedding.” It was a harsh thing to say, and I immediately regretted it. My sister looked hurt, and our parents seemed really uncomfortable. 

After that, I tried to apologize, but the damage was done. My sister hasn’t spoken to me since, and I can’t help but feel guilty for lashing out. At the same time, I wish just once someone would acknowledge what I’m going through, too.

Recently, I went through a challenging breakup, and Sarah was my support system throughout it. However, I started to notice that Sarah had been acting differently around me. She would often touch my arm or shoulder while talking and would send overly affectionate texts, which made me feel uncomfortable.

One night, we went out to a bar to unwind, and after a few drinks, I could tell she was feeling bold. She leaned in closer and confessed that she had developed feelings for me during my breakup and thought we could make a great couple. I was surprised and didn't know how to react. I told her that I appreciated her support but didn’t feel the same way and valued our friendship too much to risk it.

In a moment of frustration, I drunkenly said some hurtful things, implying that she was just trying to take advantage of my vulnerable state. I instantly regretted it, but the damage was done. She got upset, and we left the bar separately. The next day, I realized that I could have handled the situation better, and I tried to reach out to her to apologize, but she hasn’t responded.

Now, I feel guilty for how I reacted to her feelings, but at the same time, I think she shouldn't have put me in that position when I was clearly struggling. Am I the asshole here?

We both agreed to go to a tropical destination, but when it came time to book flights and accommodations, she suddenly suggested that we invite her sister and her sister's boyfriend along. 

At first, I was open to it because I thought it could be fun. However, as we started planning, it became clear that my girlfriend wanted to spend the majority of the trip with her sister and her boyfriend, leaving little time for just the two of us. I felt like our romantic getaway was turning into a group vacation, which defeated the purpose of us getting away together.

I voiced my concerns to her, explaining how important this trip was for our relationship and that I wanted to enjoy quality time together. Instead of acknowledging my feelings, she became defensive and accused me of being selfish for not wanting to include her sister. She argued that I should be more accommodating and that I was ruining the trip by not being excited about the idea of having them join us.

Things escalated quickly. I raised my voice, saying that if we went on this trip with them, I would feel like a third wheel and that it would be uncomfortable. She snapped back, saying I was being controlling and that I was trying to dictate who she could spend time with. In the heat of the moment, I told her that I didn't want to go at all if they were coming, which hurt her feelings.

Afterward, we both cooled off, but the damage was done. She ended up saying she might just plan the trip with her sister instead and that I could do whatever I wanted. I felt guilty for how I handled the situation and realized I could have communicated my feelings better, but I also think she was dismissive of my needs.

Now I’m sitting here wondering if I went too far in trying to express my discomfort about the situation or if she was overreacting to my concerns.

I snapped back, saying she was being overly dramatic and that I never said I wanted a wedding like hers anyway.

After that, the atmosphere at the dinner turned sour. Emily stormed out, and I ended up arguing with my parents about it.

I (28F) live with my boyfriend (30M) in a small apartment. We’ve been together for a few years, and while we generally get along well, we have different perspectives on cleanliness and organization. I’m pretty laid-back and don’t mind a bit of clutter, but he’s a bit of a neat freak and likes everything to be in its place.

A few weeks ago, I decided to reorganize the small bookshelf in our living room. I took some of my books off to sort through them, but I got busy with work and ended up leaving them on the coffee table for a few days. It wasn’t a huge mess, but it definitely wasn’t how he likes the space to look.

One evening, I came home from work, and he had put all the books back on the shelf, but he had also removed some of my personal items—mostly little trinkets and photos that I had placed around the apartment. I was frustrated because these items have sentimental value to me, and I felt he was overstepping by deciding what should or shouldn’t be around our home.

In the heat of the moment, I vented to my friends in a group chat, saying I felt like he was acting like my mom and treating me like a child. I didn’t name him directly, but I mentioned how irritating it was that he couldn’t just let me have my things where I liked them. I may have exaggerated a bit about how controlling he is, but I was just upset about the situation.

Later, he found out about the messages because one of my friends accidentally mentioned it to him. He confronted me about it, and I felt embarrassed and defensive. I admitted I was frustrated but didn’t think it was a big deal to vent about it. He felt betrayed that I discussed our private issues in a group chat instead of talking to him directly.

I offered to help her plan the party and take charge of the decorations and food. She was excited and we spent a lot of time discussing the details. However, as the party date approached, I started feeling overwhelmed with work and personal issues. I was also dealing with some anxiety and didn’t know how to manage everything.

When the day of the party arrived, I showed up late—30 minutes after the start time. I walked in to find her and her fiancé frantically trying to get everything ready. She gave me a look that said it all, but I tried to brush it off and help where I could. I ended up making a few mistakes while helping that made things a bit chaotic.

After the party, she confronted me about not being there to help and how it added stress to her already hectic day. I got defensive and told her that I’m going through a lot right now and that she didn’t have to take it out on me. We ended up arguing, and I stormed out, feeling hurt and frustrated.

So, am I the asshole for not being there for my friend and for getting defensive when she confronted me? Or is she being unreasonable by expecting me to be perfect while I’m struggling?

Everyone sucks here,"Sorry for any formatting issues, I’m on mobile.

So, I’ve been living with my sister for the past year after she lost her job and needed help with rent. She’s been struggling to get back on her feet, and I genuinely want to support her. But honestly, it’s been a rough experience for both of us. I have my own job and bills to manage, and sometimes I feel like she doesn’t appreciate the sacrifices I’m making.

Recently, she got a new part-time job, but it’s only a few hours a week and doesn’t pay much. I’ve noticed that she spends a lot of her free time going out with friends or staying up late playing video games. Meanwhile, I’m working extra hours to cover our bills. I tried to talk to her about it a few weeks ago, suggesting maybe she could help more around the house to ease my stress, like cooking or cleaning since I often come home exhausted. Instead of taking it well, she blew up at me, saying I was being controlling and that she deserves to enjoy her free time after all the stress she’s been under.

Fast forward to a few days ago, I came home from work to find that she had invited a bunch of friends over without telling me. The place was a mess, and they were all drinking and being loud. I lost my temper and told her that this was my home too and she needed to respect that. I ended up saying some pretty harsh things about how I was tired of carrying the financial and emotional burden of our living situation. She started crying and told me I was being insensitive and that she needed support, not more pressure.

After that, she went to stay with a friend for a couple of days, and I’ve been feeling guilty about how I reacted. I know I’ve been stressed, but I also think she could be more responsible given the situation. I’m just not sure if I crossed the line when I snapped at her. 

So, am I the asshole for losing my temper and saying those things? I really don’t know if I was justified or if I just made everything worse.",3,2435,0.56,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_69597,2018-03-19 00:00:00,ESH,1957,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I (28F) recently got into a disagreement with my boyfriend (30M) over a situation involving my sister (25F). My sister is going through a tough time, having recently lost her job and experiencing a breakup. I’ve been trying to support her as much as I can, but I also have my own responsibilities and commitments.

Last week, my sister asked if she could stay with me for a month while she gets back on her feet. I was hesitant because my boyfriend and I live in a small apartment, and I didn’t want to disrupt our routine. However, after thinking it over, I agreed, feeling that family comes first.

When I told my boyfriend about my decision, he was less than pleased. He felt that we wouldn’t have enough space and that it would be a strain on our relationship. He expressed that he didn’t want to feel like a roommate and was worried about the impact on our time together. I understood his concerns, but I also felt the need to support my sister during her crisis.

In the heat of the moment, I told him that if he didn’t want my sister to stay with us, it was selfish of him, and I felt like he didn’t care about my family. That definitely didn’t sit well with him, and he accused me of prioritizing my sister over our relationship. I got frustrated and brought up how I had made sacrifices for him in the past, which led to an argument.

Ultimately, my sister did end up staying with us, but it has caused some tension. My boyfriend has been distant, and I can tell he’s still upset about it. I’m now questioning if I handled the situation poorly by not fully considering his feelings and how it would affect us.

So, am I the asshole for prioritizing my sister's needs over my boyfriend’s feelings in this situation?",444,1067,0.78,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_82966,2023-07-07 00:00:00,ESH,1723,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Background Info: I work in a small marketing team, and we recently had a project that was really important for our upcoming campaign. There are four of us on the team, including myself, and we all have distinct roles to play.

So here’s what happened: One of my teammates, whom I'll call Jake, got really slammed with personal issues and started missing work. We had a meeting where we discussed our tasks and deadlines, and Jake was clearly not contributing as much as the rest of us. We all felt the pressure to complete the project on time, and it was becoming increasingly clear that Jake wasn't going to meet his responsibilities.

A couple of days before the deadline, I decided to bring up our concerns about Jake to our manager. I mentioned that we were worried Jake might not be able to pull his weight and that it was affecting the team's morale. My other teammates agreed with me when I brought it up, but we didn’t really have a plan for how to handle it, and I felt conflicted about going to the manager.

Afterward, Jake found out that we had talked about him, and he confronted me. He was hurt and angry, saying that we should have come to him first instead of going to the manager. I felt guilty, but I also thought I was doing what was best for the team. 

Now I’m stuck in this awkward situation where Jake doesn't want to work with me, and my other teammates are torn about whether I was right to say anything. I feel like I acted out of concern, but I also see Jake's point.

Everyone sucks here,"My friends and I have a close-knit group, and we often hang out together on weekends. Recently, one of our friends, Jake, started dating someone new, and he’s been eager to introduce her to the group. I was genuinely excited for him, but I noticed that every time we got together, Jake would dominate the conversation, constantly talking about his girlfriend and their relationship.

At first, I thought it was just excitement, but it started to feel excessive. During one of our game nights, he went on for over an hour about how they met and all their inside jokes. I tried to steer the conversation back to something more inclusive, like our favorite games or recent movies, but he'd just redirect it back to his girlfriend.

Feeling frustrated, I decided to poke a little fun at him. I made a lighthearted joke about how we should just make a podcast dedicated to his relationship. A couple of my friends laughed, but Jake didn't take it well. He got defensive and said I was being condescending. I tried to explain that I was just joking, but he didn’t seem to appreciate it.

After that, the atmosphere changed. Jake’s girlfriend, who had come to the gathering, looked uncomfortable, and I felt guilty. I didn’t mean to put him on the spot, but I also felt like he needed to be reminded to engage with the rest of us. 

Now there's a bit of tension between us, and I’m wondering if I overstepped. I think Jake could’ve toned it down a bit, but I also shouldn’t have made that joke in the first place.

Recently, I started dating someone new, Alex, and things are getting serious. Alex and I hit it off immediately, and I’ve been spending a lot of time with them.

The issue arose when Sam expressed that they felt ignored and left out since I started this new relationship. I totally get that it can be tough when a friend starts prioritizing a new partner, but I thought it was just a phase. I assured Sam that I still value our friendship and want to make time for them.

However, I started noticing Sam making passive-aggressive comments about my relationship, like how I’m ""just going to toss aside my old friends for some new fling."" This really upset me, and I confronted Sam about it. I told them that I felt hurt by those comments and that they should try to be supportive instead.

In response, Sam accused me of being insensitive to their feelings and said I needed to learn to balance my time better. I told them to stop being so dramatic and to understand that new relationships take time and effort, and that I’m not abandoning them. We both ended up raising our voices, and it got pretty heated. 

Now, I feel guilty for how that conversation went down, and I'm not sure if I was too harsh on Sam. But I also think they’re not being fair by trying to guilt me over my new relationship.

Recently, we had a team project that required a lot of collaboration, and tensions were running high due to tight deadlines.

There’s a coworker of mine, Rachel, who is relatively new and very ambitious. She's always trying to impress the higher-ups, which I respect, but it can sometimes come off as a bit overbearing. One day, while we were discussing our progress on the project, I suggested we take a more relaxed approach to meet our deadlines, focusing on quality over quantity. Rachel vehemently disagreed and insisted we push harder and faster, arguing that it would make us look better to management.

The conversation escalated into a heated debate where we were both raising our voices. I admit I got pretty frustrated and said something along the lines of, ""You’re just trying to climb the corporate ladder at everyone else's expense."" That definitely crossed the line, and it hurt her feelings; she started to cry right there in the meeting. 

Afterward, I felt terrible, and I approached her to apologize. However, I was still angry about her approach to the project, and I couldn’t help but mention that she was constantly trying to undermine me in front of the team. She responded by saying that I was just being jealous of her ambition. 

In the end, both of us ended up speaking to our manager about the incident, and while I apologized, Rachel also expressed her frustrations about how I handled the situation. The manager brought us both in for a meeting to discuss professionalism, and it ended with no clear resolution other than a warning for both of us.

Now I can't help but feel like we were both out of line.

I was excited because we’ve been friends for years and I wouldn't miss it for the world. The thing is, my girlfriend, Mia, had been planning a family reunion on the same weekend for months. She mentioned it a few times, but I thought she would understand how important Jake’s wedding was to me.

When I told her I was going to the wedding, she was upset and said I should prioritize family over friends. I tried to explain that it was a significant event for Jake, but she just kept saying I was choosing him over her family and that I didn’t care about her feelings. I felt torn between the two and didn’t want to deal with the guilt trip.

To avoid confrontation, I initially told Mia I would skip the wedding and go to the reunion instead, even though I really didn’t want to. I figured it would keep the peace for a while. But as the wedding date got closer, I started to feel really guilty about lying. 

On the day of the wedding, I decided that I couldn’t miss it after all. I went to the wedding and had an amazing time. I even posted some photos on social media, which Mia saw, and she was furious. She called me and yelled about how I betrayed her trust and prioritized my friend over her family. I tried to explain that I was feeling overwhelmed and that I loved her, but it didn’t help.

In hindsight, I realize that I shouldn’t have lied in the first place and that I could have communicated better about my feelings. But I also feel like Mia was being overly dramatic about the whole situation.

Sam got defensive and started pointing out my own messes, saying that I’m not perfect either. They were right, I have my own clutter, but in that moment, I felt like I was taking the brunt of everything. We ended up arguing for a while, and both of us said things we didn’t mean.

Now we’re both feeling hurt and frustrated. I think we both overreacted in the heat of the moment and definitely could have handled it better. Was I really being unreasonable, or were we both at fault here?",482,852,0.53,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_34753,2018-03-14 00:00:00,ESH,1643,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I live with my partner, and we both work full-time jobs. I handle most of the household chores, including cooking and cleaning, while my partner often comes home and relaxes, claiming they’re too tired to help. I’ve tried to communicate my feelings about this imbalance, but it usually ends up in a heated argument where they say they’ll help more in the future, but nothing changes.

Last week, I was particularly exhausted after a long week and decided to cook a nice dinner for us. I spent a few hours preparing it, and when I called them to come eat, they casually said they were too tired and would just grab something quick from the fridge. I felt really hurt and a bit taken for granted, but instead of calmly discussing it, I snapped and said something like, “Fine, you can eat your sad leftovers while I enjoy this meal alone!”

Later that night, they confronted me about how I overreacted and made them feel bad for not being able to join me.

Everyone sucks here,"So, there's this guy in my friend group, Mark, who I've known for a few years. He's a decent guy most of the time, but he has this habit of constantly bragging about his accomplishments and often tries to one-up everyone during conversations. It can get pretty annoying, especially when he turns every casual get-together into a competition. 

Recently, we were at a mutual friend's birthday party, and while everyone was chatting and having fun, Mark started telling this story about how he had just closed a huge deal at work and made a significant amount of money. He went into all the details, and it felt more like a lecture than a conversation. Everyone started to zone out, but he just kept going. 

At this point, I was feeling frustrated, so when the conversation shifted to hobbies, I made a comment about how I had recently taken up hiking, but I jokingly added, ""Not that I could ever make it a corporate retreat like Mark would!"" I thought it would lighten the mood, but Mark took it personally and snapped back, saying, ""Well, maybe if you worked harder, you'd get more interesting stories to tell."" 

The whole thing escalated from there. I didn’t mean to hurt his feelings, but I was just tired of him always trying to outshine everyone. A few other friends chimed in, saying they also found his bragging a bit much, which only fueled the fire. Mark ended up leaving the party early, and now it's created this awkward tension in our group.

I feel like I kind of started it with my comment, but at the same time, I think Mark needs to realize that not every conversation has to be about his achievements. We’re all friends here, but maybe we all handled it poorly.

Everyone sucks here,"So, this happened a few days ago, and I’ve been thinking about it a lot. I’m really not sure if I was in the wrong or what.

I went to a small get-together at my friend Sarah's house. It was just a few of us hanging out, playing games, and having some snacks. We had a good time, but at one point, Sarah brought out a big bowl of her famous guacamole, which everyone loves. I was really excited because I hadn’t had it in a while.

As we were digging in, I took a decent-sized scoop for myself. A little while later, I noticed that my friend Mark was barely touching the guacamole. I asked him if he was okay, and he mentioned he was trying to cut back on calories, but he really loved the guacamole too. So, I jokingly said, “Come on, Mark! It’s a special occasion; just live a little!” I thought it was a light-hearted comment.

After that, Sarah overheard and chimed in, saying something like, “Yeah, Mark, it’s just guacamole! Don’t be such a buzzkill.” Mark laughed, but I could see he was a little uncomfortable. He ended up taking a small amount, but it was clear he didn’t enjoy it as much as he wanted to.

Later in the evening, Mark pulled me aside and told me that my comment bothered him, and he felt pressured to eat something he was trying to avoid. I was taken aback, as I thought I was just being fun and encouraging him to treat himself. I apologized, but it still felt awkward.

Sarah then said I shouldn’t worry about it and that Mark was being too sensitive. I jumped in, saying that she shouldn’t dismiss Mark's feelings like that, which led to a bit of an argument between us. I felt bad for calling her out, but I also thought it was unfair to brush off what Mark said.

By the end of the night, the mood was pretty tense, and it felt like we all ended up being a bit of a mess. I mean, I was just trying to have a good time, but I guess I could have handled things differently. 

So, am I the asshole for trying to encourage Mark to enjoy the guacamole while also confronting Sarah for dismissing his feelings?",788,1203,0.8,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_64526,2018-05-16 00:00:00,ESH,2034,AITA

Last week, I decided to make a big batch of homemade chili to last us for a few days. I spent a couple of hours preparing it and was really proud of how it turned out. I told my boyfriend he could have some for lunch the next day while I was at work, and he agreed. 

When I got home from work, I discovered that he had eaten almost all of the chili. I felt really frustrated because I was looking forward to having it for dinner and thought we had agreed to share it. I confronted him about it, and he said he didn't realize I wanted it for dinner and thought it was just for him to eat whenever. 

In the heat of the moment, I called him selfish and said he could have at least left me a portion. He got defensive and said I was overreacting and that it was just food. We ended up arguing, and I felt bad for how I handled it.

When I brought it up, my partner shrugged and said, “I don’t really see the point. It’s just a living room.” I felt dismissed and a bit hurt, as I had invested time and effort into thinking about how we could make our space more enjoyable. Instead of calmly discussing it, I snapped back with, “Well, if you don’t care, then I guess I’ll just do it myself.”

That led to a heated argument where both of us ended up saying things we regretted. My partner called me “selfish” for wanting to spend money on something they deemed unnecessary, and I accused them of being unappreciative and not wanting to improve our home together. After a long back-and-forth, we both just stormed away from the conversation feeling frustrated.

Everyone sucks here,"I was at a local grocery store the other day, picking up some essentials for the week. It was a Saturday afternoon, so the store was quite busy. I was waiting in line at the self-checkout, which had a few people ahead of me. There was one family with a cart overflowing with groceries, and it was taking them quite a while to scan everything.

As I stood there, I overheard a man behind me, who looked to be in his 30s, start muttering under his breath about how ridiculous it was that the store only had a couple of self-checkout lanes open on a busy weekend. He was clearly frustrated and kept rolling his eyes. I tried to ignore him, but then he started making comments about the family in front of us, saying things like, ""Some people just don't know when to shop"" and ""Wow, do they really need all that food?""

I was feeling a bit annoyed by his negativity, so I turned around and said, ""Maybe if you didn't rush to judgment, you'd understand that not everyone has the same schedule."" He shot back with something sarcastic about how he was just trying to get in and out quickly, and I ended up saying, ""Well, maybe you should have planned better if you can't handle a line.""

Things escalated from there, and we ended up exchanging a few more heated comments. I felt justified in standing up to him, but I could see that the family in front of us was clearly uncomfortable with the whole situation. Eventually, a store employee came over and asked us to calm down, which only added to my frustration.

Looking back, I realize I didn’t have to engage with him, and I probably added to the tension instead of diffusing it.

But over the past few months, I noticed he started getting really into this new hobby of his—gaming, specifically streaming on Twitch. At first, I supported him, watched his streams, and even donated a little money to help him out.

However, as time went on, the more obsessed he became with it. He would cancel our plans last minute because he had a “streaming schedule” or spent hours talking about his stats and followers. I tried to talk to him about how it felt like I was losing my friend, but he brushed it off, saying I just didn't understand the passion.

The other day, I snapped. He canceled on me for the third time that week because he wanted to play with some new followers. I told him that he’s being selfish and that his gaming was taking priority over our friendship. I might have yelled a bit, saying something like, “It’s just a game, get your priorities straight!” 

He got really upset and told me I was being a bad friend for not supporting him. I felt bad after, but I was just so frustrated. Now we aren’t talking, and I miss hanging out, but I also think he needs to realize how he's been neglecting our friendship.

Recently, I started dating someone new, Alex. Things were going well, and I was excited to introduce them to my friends. I invited Jamie to a dinner party I was hosting to meet Alex, but Jamie seemed less than enthusiastic. She made a comment about how she wasn’t sure if she wanted to meet someone so soon after my last breakup, which had been pretty painful for me. I tried to brush it off, but it stung.

The night of the dinner party arrived, and Jamie showed up late, looking a bit disheveled. I had put a lot of effort into the meal, hoping to impress Alex and create a warm atmosphere. During dinner, Jamie kept making snide remarks about Alex, comparing them unfavorably to my ex. I felt embarrassed and frustrated, as Alex was a great person who deserved better than that.

After a few too many comments, I snapped at Jamie, telling her that her negativity was unwelcome and that she should either support me or leave. It was an intense moment, and Jamie retaliated by saying that I was acting childish and that she was just trying to look out for me. I ended up telling her that I didn’t need her to look out for me and that maybe she should consider if she genuinely wanted to be my friend. The atmosphere was tense, and the dinner ended awkwardly.

Afterward, Jamie texted me, upset about how I had treated her. I didn’t respond right away, feeling justified in my outburst but also realizing I might have overreacted. The next day, I sent her a message saying I was sorry for how I spoke to her but reiterated that I didn’t appreciate her comments about Alex. She replied, saying that she didn’t want to be friends if I couldn’t accept her opinion.

The night before the presentation, my best friend asked if I could help her out by taking care of her dog while she was away for the weekend. I told her I could, but I really needed to focus on my presentation.

The next day, I woke up early, rehearsed my presentation, and felt pretty confident. However, I got a text from my friend asking if I could pick up her dog that afternoon since she was running late at the airport. I felt torn because I didn't want to let her down, but I also didn't want to risk my own performance. I texted her back saying I’d help, but I'd need to do it quickly so I wouldn’t be late for my presentation.

It started a few months ago when my roommate adopted a dog. I’m not really a pet person, but I was okay with it initially. However, the dog ended up being quite a handful. My roommate would often leave it alone for long periods, which led to it barking and scratching at the door. I found it really disruptive, especially when I was trying to study or relax at home.

I tried to bring it up in a nice way, suggesting we set a schedule for when the dog could be alone or maybe even hire a dog walker. My roommate took it as a personal attack, saying I was being intolerant and selfish. It escalated into a big fight where we both said things we regret. I told them I wasn’t obligated to accommodate their choices, and they accused me of being callous.

After that argument, things just got worse. I think I held onto my resentment a bit too much, and I started to leave passive-aggressive notes about the dog’s behavior and how it’s affecting my space. My roommate did the same, writing notes about how I should be more understanding. 

Eventually, it got so tense that we decided to sit down and have a serious talk about it. We both admitted we were at fault and should’ve communicated better.

My partner has a teenage son who is incredibly into gaming. He spends most of his free time playing online and has developed a pretty unhealthy lifestyle around it. I’ve expressed my concerns about his lack of physical activity and social interaction, but my partner insists that it’s just a phase and that he’ll grow out of it. Meanwhile, I really believe that it’s important for kids to be active and engage with their peers in person, especially at his age.

One day, I decided to take my daughter, who is younger, to a local park for some outdoor activities, and I invited my partner and his son to join us. I thought it would be a nice way to spend time together as a blended family and encourage some of that much-needed physical activity for both kids. My partner’s son, however, flat out refused to come, saying he’d rather stay home and play video games. 

Instead of letting it go, I made a comment that I thought was light-hearted but maybe a bit pointed: “It’s a shame he’d rather be cooped up inside than enjoy the sunshine like a normal kid.” My partner snapped back at me, saying that I was being judgmental and that I didn’t understand how important gaming was for his son, both as a hobby and a social outlet. I felt defensive and told him that he was enabling a sedentary lifestyle and that he should be encouraging his son to be more active.

The argument escalated quickly. I accused him of being too lenient, while he accused me of being overbearing and not respecting his parenting choices. In the heat of the moment, I ended up yelling, “Maybe if you actually pushed him to go outside once in a while, he wouldn’t be such a lazy gamer!”

I felt torn because I didn’t want to miss her birthday or cause any conflict, but I also couldn’t imagine leaving my dogs in a kennel for the weekend.

The day before the trip, I told my sister that we wouldn’t be able to make it because we couldn’t leave our dogs. She seemed disappointed and tried to convince me to find a pet sitter, but I was firm and explained that I didn’t want to impose that on them. 

In my frustration, I blurted out that it was unfair for her to expect us to leave our pets behind when she knows how much they mean to us. She snapped back, saying it was her birthday, and she wanted a weekend without pets and that it wasn’t fair for me to put that on her. We ended up in a heated argument, and I felt guilty for not being there for her birthday.

After the conversation, I felt bad and sent her a message saying I was sorry for how things went down, but I still felt justified in my decision to prioritize my dogs. I suggested we celebrate together later, perhaps with a dinner that included my dogs. She didn’t respond, and I found out through our parents that she was really upset and felt I was being selfish.

Now I’m left wondering if I should have compromised and found a way to accommodate her wishes better, or if she should have been more understanding of my situation with the dogs.

Everyone sucks here,"Throwaway for privacy reasons.

I’m in a bit of a dilemma with my best friend ""Laura"" and I’m not sure if I handled things the right way. Laura and I have been friends for over a decade, and we’ve always been there for each other through thick and thin. Recently, Laura has been going through a tough time with her job and a breakup. She has been leaning on me a lot for support, which I’ve been happy to provide.

Last week, Laura invited me to a small gathering at her place to celebrate her recent promotion at work. I was thrilled for her, and I wanted to show my support. However, the night of the gathering, I had a major work deadline that I had completely forgotten about until the last minute. Despite my best efforts to get it done early, I ended up having to stay home to finish it.

I texted Laura to let her know that I couldn’t make it and that I was really sorry. I told her I’d celebrate with her another time. She replied that she understood but seemed a bit down about it. I felt guilty, but I thought my work was a priority since I was under a lot of stress.

The next day, I was scrolling through social media and saw that she had posted pictures from the gathering. She looked happy, but I noticed that she appeared to be somewhat disappointed as well. I reached out to her to see how it went, and she told me that she felt like I didn’t care enough about her to show up. 

I tried to explain my situation, but instead of being understanding, she snapped at me and said I always put work before our friendship. I got defensive and pointed out that she had been relying on me a lot lately, and maybe she should have planned the gathering for a different time when I wasn’t so busy. 

It turned into a heated argument where we both said things we regretted. I told her she was being overly dramatic, and she accused me of being a bad friend. Now we’re both hurt, and I feel like I might’ve been too harsh in my response. 

AITA for prioritizing my work over my friend’s celebration? Or was she being unreasonable?",883,1932,0.58,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_59134,2019-05-11 00:00:00,ESH,2032,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I (30F) have a sister, Lisa (28F), who has a pretty tumultuous relationship with our parents. They often argue, and she tends to lash out at them when she feels hurt or slighted, which has created a lot of tension in our family dynamic. I try to be a peacemaker, but it’s hard to keep the peace when everyone is so emotional.

Recently, our parents invited us for a family dinner to celebrate my birthday. I was excited, but I also knew Lisa had been feeling particularly resentful towards them. I figured it would be a good opportunity for us to bond and maybe even mend some fences. The day of the dinner, I called Lisa to see if she was coming. She was in a bad mood and told me she didn't want to go because she felt unappreciated. I tried to convince her to join us, but she refused.

Feeling frustrated, I told her that it would mean a lot to me if she came and that it was my birthday, after all. She still declined and snapped at me about how I always seemed to take our parents' side. In a moment of frustration, I suggested that if she didn't come, she really shouldn’t expect to be included in family events in the future. I was just tired of the constant fighting and wanted her to find a way to work things out.

That evening, we had dinner without Lisa. My parents were happy to celebrate with me, but I couldn’t shake the guilt I felt about our earlier conversation. After the dinner, I texted Lisa to let her know how much I missed her and hoped we could work on our issues as sisters. She responded angrily, saying I was a traitor for siding with our parents and that I had no idea how she felt.

Now I’m feeling conflicted. I wanted Lisa to come and be part of the celebration, but I also didn’t mean to hurt her feelings. I see both sides; I want my sister to feel supported, but I also want a peaceful relationship with my parents. I know I shouldn’t have snapped at her, but I also feel like she needs to take some responsibility for her own actions and relationships.

Everyone sucks here,"Hey everyone, I’m using a throwaway for this.

So I (29f) have been living in a shared apartment with three other roommates for the past year. We all have our own busy lives and schedules, but we’ve managed to get along pretty well. I work long hours, and I'm usually the last one to come home. My roommates, all in their mid-20s, tend to have more flexible hours and frequently invite friends over.

Recently, one of my roommates, Jess, started bringing over her new boyfriend, who is nice enough, but he has this habit of playing music loudly late into the night. I’ve tried to be patient since I know he’s excited about his new relationship, but it’s been pretty disruptive. We share a thin wall, and I can hear every note of whatever he’s blasting, especially on weekends.

About a month ago, I approached Jess and kindly asked if she could keep the volume down when they have people over, especially on weeknights. She seemed understanding at the time and agreed to try, but it didn’t really change anything. Their late-night hangouts kept happening, and I started feeling really frustrated.

Last weekend, after a particularly exhausting week at work, I came home around midnight to find their music blaring again. I knocked on the wall a couple of times to try to signal them to turn it down, but it didn’t work. At that point, I lost my cool and yelled through the wall that they needed to shut it down because some of us had jobs to go to in the morning. 

I could hear Jess’s boyfriend yell back something like, ""Chill out, it’s just music!"" This just made me angrier, and I shouted a few more rude things without thinking. It was definitely not my proudest moment.

Jess came to my room a bit later, clearly upset, and we had a heated argument. I told her it was disrespectful to ignore my requests, and she accused me of being a buzzkill and not being supportive of her happiness. We both said some pretty hurtful things before she stormed off.

The next day, I felt really guilty about how I handled everything. I know I shouldn’t have lost my temper, but I also think Jess could have been more considerate of my feelings. I eventually went to her and apologized for my outburst, but I also reiterated that I need my space respected. 

Now, things are still a bit tense between us, and I’m left feeling conflicted. I know I shouldn’t have yelled, but I also feel like Jess should have listened to me better. So, AITA here?",521,962,0.55,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_68393,2021-12-31 00:00:00,ESH,2435,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I've been playing guitar for over a decade and have been really passionate about it. I’ve played in bands, written my own songs, and even performed at local venues. My best friend, who I’ll call Jake, has always admired my skills but has never taken the time to learn an instrument himself.

A couple of months ago, Jake came to me and expressed an interest in learning guitar. I was excited for him and offered to help him out. We started having weekly jam sessions where I would teach him the basics. It was fun at first, but I started to notice that he was becoming increasingly frustrated with his progress. I tried to encourage him, but he kept comparing himself to where I was after years of practice, which I thought was unfair.

One day, while we were practicing, Jake mentioned that he wanted to write his own song. I was thrilled! I suggested we collaborate on it, and he agreed. I put in a lot of effort to help him craft the lyrics and the melody. However, as we worked together, I felt like he was becoming more controlling about the direction of the song. He insisted on using a particular chord progression that I wasn't a fan of, and when I suggested alternatives, he dismissed my ideas as ""not what he envisioned.""

After a week or so of back-and-forth disagreements about the song, I lost my patience and snapped at him, saying that as someone who has been playing for significantly longer, my input should carry more weight. He got upset and accused me of being dismissive of his creativity and acting like a know-it-all since he was trying to express his own artistic vision too.

We ended up having a heated argument, and it escalated to personal insults about each other’s commitment to music and how we approached hobbies in general. We both said things we regretted, and it left a rift in our friendship. 

Eventually, we decided to table the song project for a while and take a break from jamming. I feel guilty for how I reacted, but I also think Jake was unfair in disregarding my experience and contributions.

When I saw it, I felt really uncomfortable and asked her to take it down. I explained that I didn’t think it was fair to share those details without discussing it with me first, especially since it felt like she was oversharing to her followers.

She got upset and accused me of being controlling and not supportive of her expression. In my frustration, I mentioned that she was being selfish and not considering my feelings. The argument escalated, and I ended up saying some hurtful things about her need for validation through social media.

After that, she didn’t talk to me for a while. I felt bad about how things ended and later texted her to apologize, but I also mentioned how her jokes have been crossing a line. She responded saying that I was being too sensitive and that I should lighten up.

However, one of my friends, Jake, always tends to overindulge in drinking and can become a bit obnoxious. I was a little nervous about how the night would go, but I figured he would be fine with everyone there.

As the night went on, Jake started drinking heavily. At first, it was all fun and games, but then he began making inappropriate jokes and comments that made some of my friends uncomfortable. I tried to intervene and tell him to tone it down, but he just laughed it off and kept going.

The group chat went silent for a bit, but then another friend chimed in to support me, saying that it was frustrating to hear about wedding details nonstop. This led to a heated argument, with my engaged friend feeling attacked and accused of being insensitive. I didn’t mean to be harsh, but I was just so overwhelmed by her constant updates.

After that, I felt guilty for how I handled it, but I also think she should have been more aware of her timing. Now, the whole group is divided—some think I overreacted while others support my frustration. I can’t help but feel that we all played a part in this mess.

Everyone sucks here,"A few months ago, I got into a heated argument with my sister, Jess, over our family dog, Max. Jess has two young children, and she often asks me to babysit them along with Max whenever she has to run errands. I don't mind helping out, but sometimes it feels overwhelming, especially when the kids want to play rough with him and he gets anxious.

One day, Jess called me up, asking me to watch the kids because she had a last-minute appointment. I agreed, but I specifically told her that Max was not feeling well and that I didn’t want him to be disturbed. When she dropped the kids off, she just let them loose in the house without really paying attention to Max. I tried to keep the kids entertained in another room while Max was resting, but they kept sneaking away to play with him. 

After a while, things escalated. The kids started pulling Max's tail and poking him, and he became agitated. I yelled at them to stop, but they didn't listen. In a moment of frustration, I shouted that they were being mean and that they needed to treat him better. Jess overheard this and came in, furious that I’d yelled at her kids. We ended up having a huge argument where I accused her of not respecting my boundaries regarding Max, and she accused me of being too harsh with her children.

After that, things got even more tense. Jess decided she wouldn’t bring the kids over anymore, and I felt guilty because I didn’t want to ruin our relationship over a misunderstanding. But I also felt like I had a right to protect my dog. I reached out to her to apologize for yelling but stood firm on my stance about Max's well-being. Jess didn’t accept my apology, claiming I could have handled it better.

Now, I’m feeling torn. Did I overreact by yelling at the kids? Should I have just let them play with Max even though he was stressed? I feel like I was trying to do the right thing for my dog, but I also don’t want to be seen as the villain in my sister’s eyes.

Everyone sucks here,"Okay, so this is a bit of a mess and I’m not sure how people will react, but here goes.

So I (28f) was at a family gathering with my parents and my younger sister (22f). We were all sitting around, having a good time, when the conversation shifted to relationships. My sister has been dating this guy for a few months, and my parents were grilling her about him—what he does, how they met, you know how parents can be.

In the middle of this, my mom jokingly asked if she was going to bring him to family holidays. My sister, feeling a bit defensive, replied that she wasn't sure because she didn't want him to see how weird our family can be. I laughed and said, ""You mean how weird *you* can be."" It was all in good fun, but she got really offended and shot back that I should be careful because my dating life is a disaster zone.

In the heat of the moment, I joked that I could probably write a book titled “How Not to Date” based on my experiences. My sister didn’t take it well and called me an asshole for making fun of her and being so self-deprecating. I told her she was being overly sensitive and that my comments were just light-hearted banter.

My mom tried to mediate, but then she ended up siding with my sister and said I should be more supportive. I felt attacked and snapped back that my sister should toughen up and that we’re all just joking around.

In the end, my sister stormed off, and now there’s this awkward tension in the family. I feel bad for how it escalated, but I also think my sister overreacted.

Everyone sucks here,"My best friend and I have been close for over a decade. We’ve shared everything, from personal struggles to big life choices. Recently, I got a new job, which I was really excited about, and I wanted to celebrate it with my friends, including her.

I decided to throw a small gathering at my place and invited a few close friends. I mentioned that it would be a fun night with drinks and food, and I really hoped she would come. However, she told me that she felt a bit left out since I hadn’t invited her partner, who she has been dating for a few months. I explained that it was a small gathering and I wanted to keep it intimate, but she seemed really hurt and said it felt like I was excluding her.

I didn’t think much of it and went ahead with the plans. On the day of the gathering, I sent her a message saying I hoped she would change her mind and join us. She replied saying she felt like I was being selfish and that I should have considered her feelings. I thought she was overreacting a bit, but I did feel bad.

At the party, I posted some pictures on social media and tagged the other friends who were there. She saw the posts and reacted by posting a message on her own profile, indirectly calling me out for being a bad friend for not including her partner and for not considering how she felt. It escalated into a back-and-forth, where I defended my choice to have a small gathering and she expressed how disappointed she was in me.

In retrospect, I realize I could have handled the situation better by either inviting her partner or being more understanding of her feelings. I probably should have reached out to her more personally instead of just focusing on my excitement. Now, our friendship feels strained, and I'm not sure if I should apologize or if she's overreacting. 

I’m starting to wonder if we both messed up here, and I’d like to know if I’m the asshole for not inviting her partner or if she’s the one for taking it too personally.",171,2899,0.63,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_18529,2021-09-07 00:00:00,ESH,1966,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, my friend Alex has been in a tough spot lately. He lost his job a few months ago and has been struggling to pay rent, so I offered to let him crash at my place temporarily while he gets back on his feet. I really wanted to help him out, but I didn’t anticipate how much it would affect my daily life.

I live alone and enjoy having a quiet environment, so when Alex moved in, things changed drastically. He's been pretty unmotivated, staying up late playing video games, and it’s been hard for me to focus on my work during the day. I tried talking to him about it, suggesting he keep the noise down at night and maybe look for a job during the day instead of gaming, but he brushed it off, saying he needed a break and that he’d figure it out.

After a few weeks, I reached my breaking point. One night, I woke up at 2 AM to the sound of him laughing and yelling while playing with his friends online. I snapped and yelled at him to be quiet, and he yelled back, saying I was being unreasonable and that he was just trying to have fun while dealing with everything.

The next day, I apologized for yelling but reiterated that I needed him to respect my space and keep the noise down, especially at night. He was still upset and defensive, claiming I was being unsupportive and that he was just trying to live his life. I ended up losing my temper again and told him that maybe he needed to find somewhere else to stay if he couldn’t respect my home.

Now, he’s considering moving out, and mutual friends are telling me I overreacted and should have been more understanding given his situation. I feel bad about the way things went down, but I also think that I deserve some peace in my own home.

Everyone sucks here,"Background: My partner and I recently moved to a new apartment complex, and we’ve been trying to get to know our neighbors.

A few days ago, I decided to bake some cookies as a way to introduce ourselves to the people living around us. I made a large batch of chocolate chip cookies and packaged them in small bags to give out. I went door to door, starting with the neighbors directly next to us. Most of them were friendly and appreciative, but one neighbor, an older woman, seemed less than pleased.

When I knocked on her door, she opened it with a frown and barely acknowledged me. I introduced myself and offered her some cookies, saying, “I just wanted to share these as a welcome treat!” She glanced at the cookies, then looked back at me with a disapproving expression and said, “I don’t want any sweets. I’m on a diet.” 

Instead of just saying okay and moving on, I responded, “Well, you could always save them for later or share them with someone else.” This seemed to irritate her further. She snapped back, “I said I don’t want them! Can’t you take a hint?” 

Feeling a bit embarrassed and defensive, I said, “Wow, no need to be rude. I was just trying to be nice!” She slammed the door in my face. I left feeling frustrated, but I later realized that I could have just walked away after her initial rejection instead of escalating the situation.

*Edit for clarification*

I recognize that my comment might have come off as pushy, and I didn't consider her feelings about her diet. At the same time, I felt hurt by her rudeness and didn’t handle it well.

We’ve always had a bit of a playful rivalry, and I know he looks up to me. However, I’ve always been more ambitious in my career, and I have a pretty high-powered job in tech.

When Jake got engaged, I felt it was my duty to give him some “brotherly advice” about marriage and relationships. I wanted to share my experiences and what I’ve learned, thinking it would help him avoid pitfalls I’ve encountered. I started making comments about how he should take his time, focus on his career, and not rush into things. 

One day during dinner, I went a bit overboard. I jokingly said something like, “You know, marriage is basically a legal contract that can ruin your life if you’re not careful. Just look at how many people end up miserable!” Lisa was present, and I noticed she went quiet. Jake laughed it off at first, but I could see he was uncomfortable.

After dinner, Lisa confronted me privately. She told me that my comments were really hurtful and that she felt like I didn’t respect their relationship. I brushed it off, saying I was just looking out for my brother. But then Jake came to me and asked me to stop with the negativity, explaining how he and Lisa are really excited about their future together and don’t need my unsolicited advice.

Everyone sucks here,"So here’s the situation. I work in a marketing department with a small team of five people. I’m in my late 30s, and while I like to think of myself as a friendly and approachable person, I can get a bit sarcastic at times. My coworkers, especially one woman in her early 30s, often tease me about my single status and how I should get out there more.

Recently, we had a team meeting where we were brainstorming ideas for a new campaign. During the meeting, I suggested a concept that I thought was really creative. However, instead of taking it seriously, the woman who often teases me made a joke about how my idea sounded like something only a desperate single person would come up with. I was a bit taken aback and, feeling defensive, I shot back with, “Well, at least I’m not so desperate that I’d resort to making lame jokes just to get attention!”

This escalated into a bit of a back-and-forth where we were both throwing snarky comments at each other. The rest of the team was a little uncomfortable, but they laughed nervously because it seemed like we were just playfully teasing each other. After the meeting, I could tell that she was upset. I didn’t think my comment was that harsh, but I did realize that it may have crossed a line.

Later that afternoon, she came to my desk and told me that I was out of line and that my comment really hurt her feelings. I felt bad, but I also felt like she had started it. I apologized, but I also told her that I felt like she needed to lighten up a bit and that we were just joking. She didn’t take it well and said that my sarcasm can sometimes come off as really mean.

Mark, however, laughed and added onto the joke, which hurt my feelings. I felt like he didn't care about how I was feeling in front of his friends.

I was hesitant because I knew how much work goes into hosting, and I also felt overwhelmed with my current workload. I expressed my concerns about how stressed I was and suggested we could maybe do a casual get-together instead, but my partner insisted that we should go ahead with the dinner party because they really wanted to see everyone and thought it would be fun.

After some back and forth, I reluctantly agreed, but I made it clear that I wouldn’t be able to do much in terms of preparation or cooking because of my workload.

I texted the group to see if anyone had a problem with a dog joining us, and most were indifferent. However, one friend, Mike, expressed that he was allergic and preferred not to be around dogs.

The mood immediately shifted, and it got really awkward. Sarah left shortly after, saying she didn’t want to be around people who couldn’t take the game seriously. The rest of us felt uncomfortable and ended up just finishing the night without her.

In retaliation, she accused me of being a control freak and not understanding her need for freedom. I ended up snapping back and told her that her “freedom” was ruining our family’s stability. 

The party went ahead, and while it was fun, it did disturb our parents, who ended up stressed and overwhelmed. After the party, I felt guilty for the way I spoke to her, but I still believe she should have been more considerate.

Everyone sucks here,"I'm using a throwaway for this because I don't want my friends or family to find out.

So, I (25F) have a close-knit friend group that includes three friends: Sarah (26F), Mike (27M), and Lucy (24F). We've all been friends for years and we hang out quite a bit. Recently, we decided to plan a camping trip for the long weekend. Everyone was excited and we all agreed to split the costs for food and supplies.

Not long before the trip, Sarah told me she was really tight on money and couldn't contribute much to the food budget. I felt bad for her, so I offered to cover her share, which was about $100. I thought it would be a nice gesture since we’re friends and I have some savings. However, I asked her to help with the driving, since she has a car and is a good driver.

Fast forward to the trip: Sarah ended up not helping out at all. She insisted on bringing her own snacks and just ate those instead of the group meals we prepared. When it was time to split other costs, she also avoided contributing, saying she’d already spent a lot on her own snacks. This frustrated me because I felt taken advantage of. 

I ended up confronting her about it during the trip, and I was pretty blunt. I said that it wasn’t fair for her to expect us to cover her and not pitch in when she clearly had the means to help out. She got defensive and accused me of being unsupportive and not understanding her financial situation. 

After that, Mike and Lucy also chimed in, saying I was being too harsh and that I could have approached it more gently. I felt like they were siding with her and it made me upset. 

Now, I’m feeling guilty about how I handled it, but at the same time, I think I had a right to address the issue. Everyone has their own struggles, but friendships should also have some give and take, right? 

So, AITA for calling out Sarah for not contributing during our camping trip, or did I overstep?",443,1562,0.84,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_74504,2021-10-10 00:00:00,ESH,1908,AITA

I had already made plans with another friend to go to the concert. When I told my original friend about it, they got really upset and accused me of abandoning them. I felt bad, but I didn’t want to miss out on the concert, especially since I had already made new plans. 

In response, I sent them a message saying that they could have let me know sooner about the wedding and that I wasn't obligated to wait for them.

They’ve been together for about six months, and I’ve always thought Lisa was great. However, I’ve also been friends with Jake long before they started dating, and I know how he can sometimes act when he feels threatened or insecure.

Recently, I noticed that Jake seemed a bit distant and I overheard him talking to another friend about how he felt like Lisa was becoming more independent and spending too much time with her own friends. So, in an attempt to help him feel better, I casually brought up how I noticed they were both busy and suggested he might want to surprise her with a date or something special to remind her how much he cares.

However, after I suggested this, Jake flipped out. He accused me of trying to meddle in his relationship and said I was undermining him. I was honestly just trying to be supportive and didn't think it was a big deal that I mentioned it. But then, on the flip side, I also ended up venting to Lisa about Jake’s insecurity and how I thought it was affecting their relationship. I thought it might help her understand where he was coming from.

When Jake found out I talked to Lisa, he was furious and called me a traitor. He said I shouldn’t have involved her in their issues and that I was being a bad friend by not respecting his boundaries. I felt bad, but I also think he was overreacting a bit. I tried to explain to him that I thought I was helping, but he just kept saying I was making things worse.

Now, I feel caught in the middle. I didn’t mean to stir the pot, but I also think Jake is being a bit too sensitive about it. Everyone thinks I should have just stayed out of it completely. I feel like I was trying to help both sides, but maybe I crossed a line?

As the night progressed, Sarah started to feel overwhelmed with the number of guests. She expressed her discomfort to me a couple of times, but I brushed it off, wanting to keep the party lively. I thought she was just being a bit uptight. Eventually, she snapped and told me it was too much and that I should have stuck to our original plan. I was taken aback and felt like she was overreacting. In the heat of the moment, I told her that she was being dramatic and that it was just a party.

After a bit of awkward tension, we tried to enjoy the rest of the night. However, I accidentally spilled a drink on her favorite shirt while trying to be funny, which didn’t help the situation. She got really upset, and I felt terrible about it. I offered to pay for the shirt, but she just stared at me and walked away to cool off.

He called me ""the emotional one"" and said that I was probably out there crying because I couldn’t handle the crowd. It felt like a jab, and I felt hurt that he would say something like that to his sister, especially when I was just trying to take care of myself.

When I came back inside, I confronted him about it. I told him that it was really insensitive and that he shouldn’t talk about me that way, especially to family. He got defensive and said I was overreacting and that it was just a joke. I told him that I didn’t appreciate being the punchline in front of others, especially when I was already feeling vulnerable.

He then snapped and said that I was being too sensitive and that I needed to lighten up. It turned into a big argument where we both raised our voices, and eventually, I walked out of the gathering. I felt embarrassed and angry, and I didn’t want to ruin the birthday celebration for everyone else.

Afterward, I felt bad for causing a scene, but I also felt like I had a right to stand up for myself. He later texted me saying he was sorry for making the joke but felt that I overreacted. I told him that it was a two-way street and that he also needed to consider how his words affected me.

My partner has a habit of being late to plans, and it drives me crazy. We had a dinner reservation for a special occasion, and I reminded them multiple times throughout the week to be on time.

I arrived at the restaurant and thought, “I’ll just get a drink and wait.” Well, my partner showed up half an hour later, clearly upset. I could tell they were hurt that I hadn’t waited. Instead of apologizing or discussing it calmly, they snapped at me about being inconsiderate and that I should have known they would be late. This turned into a big argument in the middle of the restaurant, where I raised my voice and expressed how their tardiness affects me.

Recently, we decided to throw a small get-together at my place to celebrate my birthday. I invited a few close friends, and everyone seemed excited.

The night of the party, everything was going well until my best friend, Mike, showed up with his new girlfriend, Sarah. I've known Mike for years, and I was happy to see him happy, but I didn't know much about Sarah. She seemed nice, but she was a bit standoffish, which made me feel uncomfortable for some reason.

As the night progressed, we moved to the living room for some games, and I noticed that Sarah was increasingly dismissive of my attempts to include her. I tried to engage her in conversation, but she kept giving short answers and looking away. After a while, I got frustrated and made a comment about how ""not everyone is as socially awkward as you."" It was meant as a joke, but it landed poorly, and I could see her face change.

Mike immediately got defensive, telling me to back off and that I should apologize. I snapped back, saying she was being rude and that I shouldn’t have to cater to her if she wasn’t even trying to be part of the group.

After that, Sarah started ignoring me in our group chats and even made a comment to our friends saying that she felt uncomfortable around me now.

My sister and I took a weekend trip to a popular beach town to celebrate her recent promotion. We were really looking forward to this getaway, especially since we hadn’t spent much time together lately.

On our first night, we decided to go to a well-reviewed seafood restaurant. The place was packed, but we were willing to wait. We got a table and placed our drink orders right away. After about 30 minutes of waiting, we finally received our drinks, but we noticed the table next to us, which had arrived well after us, was already being served appetizers.

After another 30 minutes, we still hadn’t received our food, despite having ordered a couple of share plates and main dishes. I managed to catch the attention of a server and asked for an update. She seemed flustered and told us they were just really busy, and that our food would be out shortly.

Another 20 minutes passed, and I felt frustrated. I called over a different server and expressed my concern about how long we had been waiting. I probably came off a bit too aggressive, but I mentioned how disappointed we were given the restaurant's reputation. The server apologized and promised to check on our order.

At this point, my sister told me to calm down and just enjoy the evening, but I pushed back, saying it wasn’t fair to let poor service slide. I suggested we should ask to speak to a manager if our food didn’t arrive soon. My sister reluctantly agreed, even though she was more understanding about the situation than I was.

After a full hour and 15 minutes, our food finally arrived. When the server set down our plates, I casually mentioned, “Took you long enough,” with a sarcastic laugh. This understandably upset the server, and she snapped back that they were doing their best. I could see her frustration, but I was also annoyed at how we had been treated.

My sister and I ended up having a tense dinner, and I could tell she was embarrassed by my attitude. After we finished eating, the manager came over to apologize for the delay, and I ended up expressing my dissatisfaction again, which only made things worse. It was an awkward end to the evening, and I realized I might have overreacted.

Jake has had a longstanding tradition of playing video games with our group of friends every Friday night. It’s something we all look forward to, a time to unwind and have fun. A few weeks into their relationship, Sarah expressed her disapproval of Jake spending so much time gaming. She told him it was a waste of time and that he should be more focused on his career and their relationship. Jake, being a bit of a people-pleaser, started to skip our gaming nights to spend more time with her.

I tried to be supportive at first, thinking that maybe she just wanted to spend quality time together. But then, I noticed that Sarah was actively discouraging him from participating in other activities we used to do as a group. She even suggested that Jake should “grow up” and “stop playing childish games.” This really upset me because it felt like she was trying to change him.

One night, I confronted Jake about it. I told him I felt like he was being unfairly pressured and that I missed our gaming nights. Jake got defensive and said that I should be more understanding of his relationship and that Sarah was just looking out for him. I ended up raising my voice a bit, saying that I felt like he was letting her take away something important from his life.

After dinner, I tried to lighten the mood by sharing some of my recent work successes. I was met with a lukewarm response, and my parents quickly shifted the conversation back to my sister. Frustrated, I commented, ""Can we please stop talking about her job for two seconds? Some of us have good news to share too!"" 

The atmosphere turned tense immediately. My sister shot me a hurt look, and my parents were visibly upset. My sister then started to cry, saying that I was being insensitive and that she just wanted a supportive environment to talk about her struggles. I felt bad but also frustrated because I wanted my achievements to be recognized too. 

Later, my parents told me that I was rude and should have been more supportive of my sister during a tough time. I think they might have overreacted, but I do see that I could have handled my feelings better.

Everyone sucks here,"My friends and I planned a weekend camping trip in the mountains, and it was supposed to be a fun getaway. There were four of us: me, my best friend Sarah, her boyfriend Mike, and my boyfriend Josh. We all have a good dynamic, or so I thought.

The first night, we set up camp and had a great time around the fire. We started talking about relationships and past experiences, and I casually brought up how Josh has a tendency to be forgetful, especially when it comes to dates and anniversaries. I thought it was a light-hearted joke, but Sarah chimed in, saying she thought it was funny that I put up with it. In the moment, I laughed it off, but I felt a bit embarrassed.

The next day, while hiking, the conversation steered towards how we all manage our partners' quirks. At some point, Mike made a comment about how if someone is forgetful, it usually means they don't care enough. I took that personally, and I think I let my emotions get the better of me. I snapped and said, ""Well, maybe if you didn't treat Sarah like a child, she'd feel like an adult."" Everyone went quiet, and I instantly regretted it.

Sarah shot back, saying I shouldn't talk about their relationship when I clearly have issues of my own. It turned into a back-and-forth, with me defending my relationship and her defending hers. Josh tried to mediate, but it was messy. Eventually, we all went our separate ways to cool off, but the mood was completely ruined.

Later that night, when we were supposed to gather for a fun game night, Sarah refused to engage, and I felt terrible about how it escalated. I tried apologizing to her, but she just brushed me off, saying I was being childish. I felt justified in my feelings because I thought Mike's comment was out of line too, but I also recognized that I shouldn't have snapped at Sarah.

Now I'm left wondering if I was the asshole for bringing up my boyfriend's forgetfulness in the first place or if Sarah was wrong to take offense. Also, I feel bad for how I reacted. 

TL;DR - I made a joke about my boyfriend's forgetfulness during a camping trip, which escalated into an argument with my friend about her relationship. We both ended up hurt, and I don't know who was more in the wrong.",793,1203,0.87,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_90251,2019-09-05 00:00:00,ESH,2222,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My (30M) sister (28F) is getting married soon, and it's been a whirlwind of planning for her. She’s been super stressed about everything, and I try my best to support her. However, there’s been one ongoing issue: her fiancé (29M) and I don’t really get along. He’s a nice guy, but he has a tendency to be overly critical and condescending, especially towards my interests.

A few weeks ago, my sister asked me to help with some wedding planning, particularly around the music and entertainment. I’m a musician and have a decent amount of experience in organizing events. I was excited to help, but when I made some suggestions, her fiancé shot them down almost immediately, claiming they wouldn’t appeal to the “general crowd” and that he didn’t want a “weird” vibe at the wedding.

Feeling a bit frustrated, I pushed back, saying that it’s my sister’s wedding too, and she should have some say in what makes her happy. This led to a bit of a heated argument between me and him, with my sister caught in the middle. I didn’t mean to escalate things, but I felt like he was dismissing my input without even considering it.

A few days later, my sister pulled me aside to talk about what happened. She told me that my behavior during the argument was not okay and that I was being too confrontational. I felt blindsided—wasn’t I just standing up for her and my ideas? So, I replied that I thought he was being a bit of an asshole too, and that maybe he should listen to her instead of just flexing his control over the wedding planning.

This sparked a family discussion where things got heated again, with both my sister and her fiancé getting upset at me for being disrespectful. I didn’t back down on my feelings but maybe I could have expressed them better. Now, my sister is upset with me, and I feel like I may have overstepped.

So, Reddit, AITA for standing up for my sister’s preferences, or did I cross a line?",75,1899,0.84,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_47017,2019-06-13 00:00:00,ESH,1918,AITA

We both have kids from previous relationships, and while I try to be more relaxed and let them figure things out on their own, my partner believes in strict discipline and structure. 

Recently, during a family gathering, one of my kids made a mess while playing with their food. My partner, in front of everyone, scolded them harshly, saying they needed to learn to be responsible. I felt embarrassed and frustrated, so I intervened and told my kid it was okay to have fun and not to worry about the mess. This led to an argument right there in front of family, where my partner accused me of being irresponsible and undermining their authority. I snapped back, saying that they were being too harsh and that kids should have the freedom to be kids.

He’s been super down, and I’ve been trying to be there for him as much as I can. We hang out almost every day, and I’ve been listening to him vent about his ex and his feelings. 

However, I recently started dating someone new, Sarah (23F), and things have been going really well. I wanted to share this good news with Jake, but I was also nervous about how he’d react since he’s been so upset. When I finally told him, he looked genuinely happy for me at first, but then he suddenly got quiet and started making passive-aggressive comments about how I was moving on too fast and how he expected me to be more supportive of his feelings. 

I tried to reassure him that I would always be there for him and that I wasn’t trying to downplay what he was going through. But the more I tried to explain, the angrier he got. He accused me of abandoning him now that I’ve found someone new. I got frustrated and snapped back that he needed to get over his ex and that it was unfair for him to expect me to put my life on hold for him.

Things escalated, and I ended up telling him that I couldn’t be his emotional crutch forever, and he needed to start taking responsibility for his own healing. That really hurt him, and he ended up storming out of my place. Now I feel guilty for how I handled it, but I also think he was being unreasonable.

Everyone sucks here,"Throwaway account, and I'm on mobile, so please bear with me. 

So, I'm a 25-year-old guy, and I have a close-knit group of friends. We've been friends since college, and we often hang out together. Recently, I've been really into cooking and decided to take a few classes to improve my skills. I've been trying out new recipes and hosting dinner parties for my friends to showcase my cooking.

My friend Sarah, who is also part of our friend group, has always been known for her baking. She's really talented, and her desserts are always the highlight of any get-together. When I invited everyone over for a dinner party last week, I asked her to bring dessert because I wanted to impress everyone with my cooking without overshadowing her talent. I thought it would be a nice balance.

When Sarah arrived, I was excited to show off my main dish. But instead of just enjoying my cooking, she kept making comments about how she ""couldn't help but notice"" that I was trying to compete with her. I felt like she was undermining my efforts and not giving me the credit I deserved. I explained that I was just trying to share my new passion and that it wasn't a competition. 

Things escalated when I jokingly said, ""Well, if you think I'm trying to compete, maybe I should just throw out my cooking and stick to ordering takeout."" She took it seriously and got really upset, saying I was being passive-aggressive and that I should just own my cooking rather than trying to hide behind her desserts.

After that, the atmosphere turned awkward, and it felt like the fun of the night was ruined. I realized I was being overly defensive because I wanted validation from my friends. But at the same time, I felt like Sarah was being unnecessarily confrontational about something that was supposed to be fun.

Now, I’m left wondering if I was wrong for bringing it up at all or if she overreacted. We’ve both apologized to each other since then, but I can’t shake the feeling that we both contributed to making things tense. So, AITA for trying to showcase my cooking while asking Sarah to bring dessert, or was she out of line for making it a competition? 

Edit: I realize now that I could have approached the situation differently. I should have communicated better and reassured her that I wasn’t trying to compete, but I also feel she could have been more supportive of my new hobby.

I found out that my partner had been spending a lot of money on things we hadn’t discussed, including some expensive tech gadgets and clothes. When I confronted them, they got defensive and said they deserved to treat themselves after working hard.

Instead of reconciling, I decided to take a different approach. I started to hide some of the money from our joint account, thinking I would use it for something fun for myself. I didn't tell my partner, and I started making small purchases that they wouldn’t be aware of. It felt petty, but I justified it as a way to show them how it felt to be kept in the dark about finances.

Fast forward to last week, my partner noticed some discrepancies in the account and confronted me about it. I felt cornered and finally admitted what I had been doing. They were furious and said I was being manipulative and dishonest. In response, I told them they brought this on themselves by being secretive about their spending. 

Now we’re both feeling hurt and angry, and I wonder if I should have just communicated better instead of playing games with money.

Everyone sucks here,"I’m a 28-year-old woman, and I've been working at my current job for about three years now. Recently, my friend from college, who I had lost touch with, reached out to me looking for a job. I knew that we had some good times in school, but she could be pretty self-centered and often talked about herself a lot, which sometimes rubbed me the wrong way. 

Still, I wanted to help her out, so I recommended her for an open position in my department. I even put in a good word with my manager, who ended up interviewing her. When she got hired, I was happy for her, but I also felt a little uneasy because I could sense some of my colleagues weren’t thrilled about her joining, especially since she tends to dominate conversations and can be dismissive of others’ ideas.

A couple of weeks in, she started calling me out during meetings, making sarcastic comments about my input, and I found myself defending my ideas more than I was comfortable with. It made the work environment tense, and I felt like I was losing my confidence. 

One day, I lost my cool and confronted her after a particularly frustrating meeting. I told her that she needed to tone it down and be more respectful of everyone else in the room. She reacted poorly, saying I was jealous of her success and that I was just being overly sensitive. 

After that, things got messy. She went to our manager and complained about me, claiming I was bullying her. I ended up feeling really bad about how I handled it and realized that maybe I was too aggressive in my approach. But at the same time, I felt like I had to stand up for myself and the team.

Now, there’s this tension in our friendship and at work, and I can’t help but feel like we both contributed to it. Some coworkers are taking sides, and it’s just an awkward atmosphere all around.

Later, I realized that while I was trying to be helpful, I was also undermining Sarah in front of her guests. My friend later told me that I crossed a line by not respecting Sarah’s authority as the host. I felt bad, but I also thought I was just being practical.

L and I have been pretty good about keeping the place tidy, but J has a much different approach to cleanliness.

At first, I tried to be patient. J would leave dirty dishes all over the living room, his laundry piled high in the hallway, and I often found food wrappers stuffed under the couch. I talked to L about it, and she assured me that he’d get better once he got settled. But after a couple of months, it became clear that wasn’t happening.

I confronted J, saying, “Can you please just pick up after yourself? This is getting ridiculous!” He looked at me like I was the crazy one and shrugged it off.

This turned into a back-and-forth where I’d express my frustration and he’d dismiss it. L tried to mediate, but it mostly ended up in me being the bad guy for being “too harsh.” I finally decided enough was enough and made a plan. I gathered all of J’s stuff from the common areas—dishes, clothes, and trash—and dumped it all in his room while he was out with friends. I figured that seeing the mess in his own space would finally get him to take responsibility.

When J came home and saw what I had done, he freaked out. He stormed into the living room, yelling at me for being an asshole and invading his personal space. L jumped in, saying I was out of line and that I should have just talked to him instead of resorting to this. I felt justified, thinking maybe this would finally spark a change.

During the planning process, I made it very clear that having a traditional Italian wedding was important to me. My partner initially agreed, but as the date approached, they started to express doubts. They wanted something simpler, less chaotic, and I could see they were getting increasingly anxious about the idea of a big gathering.

I felt torn because I didn't want to dismiss their feelings, but at the same time, I felt like my own family traditions were being pushed aside.

Sarah has always been a bit of a traditionalist, and she wants her wedding to be very classic—think lots of meat on the menu, an open bar with no non-alcoholic options, and a big dance party. I, on the other hand, have become sober for health reasons and have also switched to a mostly plant-based diet over the past year.

When I brought up my dietary restrictions, Sarah laughed and said, ""Come on, it’s just one day! You can eat a little meat or drink a little wine, right? Don't be so uptight!"" I explained that it's not about being uptight; it's a personal choice that I take seriously for my health. She kept insisting that I should just loosen up and enjoy the day like everyone else.

This continued over the next few planning discussions, where she would make jokes about my dietary choices. At one point, she even said, ""If you're not eating meat at my wedding, you might as well not show up!"" I felt really disrespected and hurt by her comments. It's one thing to have a difference in lifestyle choices, but it felt like she was belittling me for mine.

Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I have been together for about three years. We both work full-time, and while we generally share household responsibilities, things have been a bit lopsided lately. I work in a demanding job with long hours, while my partner works a more traditional 9 to 5. 

Over the past couple of months, my workload has increased significantly. I often find myself bringing work home and working late into the night, which has left me feeling exhausted. My partner, on the other hand, has been complaining about how messy our apartment has become and has asked me to help more with chores. I understand their frustration, but I feel overwhelmed and exhausted.

One weekend, I finally snapped. I had a big project due on Monday, and on top of that, I was also trying to keep up with cooking and cleaning. I told my partner that I needed a full day to focus on my work and that they would have to handle the cleaning and cooking for the weekend. They were understandably annoyed, saying that they were tired too and that I was being selfish. I felt guilty, but I insisted I needed to prioritize my job.

On Saturday, I locked myself in the home office, working nonstop and ignoring the mess around the apartment. My partner tried to ask me for help multiple times, but I just waved them off. I didn’t come out until late in the evening, and by then, they had done a lot of the cleaning, but they were upset and frustrated.

We had a big argument that night. I pointed out that I had a valid reason for needing the time to focus, while they were just being dramatic about the chores. They said that I was neglecting my responsibilities as a partner. I countered that they weren't being understanding about the pressures of my job. 

In the heat of the moment, I said some hurtful things, including that they were overreacting and that I was the one making the sacrifices for our future. They threw back that they felt like they were the only one trying to keep the home together while I just sat in my office.

After the argument, we both went to bed angry, and in the morning, I felt awful for how we had handled things. I realized that I had dismissed my partner's feelings and that I could have communicated better about my needs while still being considerate of theirs.

So, here I am, wondering if I am the asshole for how I handled the situation. I know I needed that weekend to focus on my work, but I also recognize that I could have been more supportive and less dismissive of my partner's feelings. 

Am I the asshole for prioritizing my work and shutting my partner out?",341,2903,0.52,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_75639,2023-10-06 00:00:00,ESH,2581,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, I (24F) have a friend, Jake (25M), who I’ve known for years. Recently, he got into a relationship with a woman named Sarah (23F). They've been dating for about six months, and while I’m happy for them, I can’t shake the feeling that Sarah doesn’t really like me. 

Last week, Jake invited a few friends over for a game night, and Sarah tagged along. During the evening, I noticed that Sarah was making little snarky comments about me, like how I was “always trying to steal Jake’s attention” or how I should “let him have fun with his girlfriend.” It really rubbed me the wrong way, especially since I always try to include her in conversations and be friendly.

At one point, I got frustrated and told her that if she had a problem with me, she could just say it to my face instead of throwing passive-aggressive jabs. It turned into a bit of a heated exchange, and Jake tried to mediate, but I ended up saying that I thought it was sad that she felt threatened by our friendship. She got really upset, and I could see that I hurt her feelings.

After things calmed down, I felt terrible about how it escalated, but I also felt justified in standing up for myself. I ended up leaving early because the atmosphere was so awkward, and Jake texted me later saying I was out of line. Meanwhile, Sarah posted on social media about how she felt bullied by my comments, which made me feel even worse.

I reached out to Jake to apologize for my part in the argument, but I also explained that I felt like Sarah was being rude to me first. Now, both of them are upset with me, and I’m left feeling like everyone is an asshole in this situation, including myself.

TLDR: I confronted my friend’s girlfriend after she made snarky comments about me, which escalated into a fight. Now I feel like I’m in the wrong, but so are they.",873,1847,0.63,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_58011,2022-11-18 00:00:00,ESH,1823,AITA

I'm a 25-year-old guy living with my girlfriend (let's call her Sarah), who is 24. We've been together for about three years now, and we both work full-time. Sarah has a pretty demanding job, and I work from home, which gives me a bit more flexibility.

Recently, Sarah started a new project at work that's been really stressful for her. She's been coming home late a lot and is completely drained. I try my best to support her and make things easier at home. I cook dinner most nights, do the laundry, and keep things tidy. However, I've noticed that she hasn't been that appreciative lately. 

About a week ago, I had a particularly rough day at work myself. I lost a client, and it hit me hard. I was feeling pretty down when Sarah got home. She walked in, immediately started venting about her day, and I just didn't have the energy to engage. I was quiet and didn’t offer her the usual support I would.

After a few minutes, she snapped at me, asking why I was being so distant. I told her I was just tired and didn’t feel like talking. She got upset, saying that I was being selfish and that she needed someone to lean on after her stressful day. I felt bad, but I also felt like she wasn't recognizing that I was having a tough time too.

In my frustration, I blurted out that maybe if she didn't have such a high-pressure job, she wouldn't be so stressed all the time. It was a low blow, and I immediately regretted it. She was hurt and angry, and we ended up having a huge argument. 

Later that night, we both calmed down, and I apologized for what I said. She apologized too, for not considering how my day had been. But I can't shake the feeling that I was a jerk for how I responded to her initial frustration. 

Now we're both walking on eggshells, trying to repair the damage. I know I should have been more supportive, but I also feel like she should have been more understanding of my feelings too.

Jake has been in a serious relationship with his girlfriend, Emma, for about a year now. I’ve gotten to know her, and while she’s a nice person, I feel like she has a bit of a controlling nature. For example, she often suggests how Jake should spend his time and who he should hang out with, which I’ve mentioned to Jake in passing.

Recently, Jake invited me to a small get-together at his place, but Emma made it clear she didn’t want me to come. She has this notion that I’m a bad influence because I like to party and have fun, whereas she’s more reserved and serious. Jake told me he was caught between wanting to please Emma and wanting to hang out with me. I felt hurt, but I tried to be understanding.

In a moment of frustration, I confronted Jake about it and told him I thought he was being whipped and that he needed to stand up for himself. I said that Emma shouldn't dictate who he spends time with and that he needed to prioritize his friendships, especially since I’ve always been there for him. This upset him, and he accused me of not being supportive and trying to drive a wedge between him and Emma.

Recently, things have taken a turn after he started dating Jen (26F), who I’ve known casually for a while. Sam is madly in love with her, and I get that, but I’ve noticed some concerning behaviors from Jen that I felt I should address with Sam.

Last week, Sam and I were hanging out, and he mentioned that Jen has been really controlling about his friendships, particularly mine. He told me she complained to him about me and how I supposedly have a “negative influence” on him. This struck me as odd because I’ve always been supportive of Sam and his choices. So, I decided to bring it up with Jen directly when I saw her a few days later.

I casually asked her why she felt that way about me. Instead of having a constructive conversation, Jen got defensive and accused me of trying to undermine her relationship with Sam. I felt attacked, and in the heat of the moment, I told her that she was being overbearing and that if she truly cared about Sam, she wouldn’t try to isolate him from his friends. I could tell this upset her, and she stormed off.

Later that day, I got a call from Sam, who was furious. He said I should have kept my mouth shut and not involved myself in their relationship. I told him that I was just trying to look out for him, but he said it wasn’t my place to say anything. He accused me of being jealous of their relationship, which honestly isn’t true at all.

I’ve tried to brush it off, but it really started to get to me, especially since we often hang out with his family at gatherings.

A couple of months ago, we had a family barbecue, and she made some offhand comments about my outfit, calling it ""a sad attempt at being trendy."" I was frustrated but tried to laugh it off. Later, I overheard her talking to a cousin about how ""embarrassing"" it is to have me in the family. That was the last straw for me.

So, I decided to take action. I created a group chat with some of my close friends and his family members, including his sister, and I shared screenshots of her comments and critiques over the last few months. I thought it would be a way for everyone to see how she treats me and to call her out on her behavior. I encouraged others to share their experiences with her too.

When she found out, she was furious and said I was trying to ruin her reputation and that I can't take a joke. Our family gatherings have turned awkward since then, with some siding with me and others thinking I took it too far.

She’s investing a lot of money into it, and while I understand wanting to have a beautiful day, I can’t help but feel that she’s lost sight of what truly matters. She’s become quite obsessed with the details, and it seems like everything is about the wedding rather than the marriage.

I recently brought this up during a casual conversation, expressing my concerns that she might be prioritizing the wedding over her relationship with Mark. Rachel got defensive and accused me of trying to undermine her happiness. I didn’t mean to upset her, but I genuinely believe that couples should focus on building a strong foundation rather than just throwing a big party.

Things escalated when I made a comment about how spending so much on a wedding could lead to financial stress later on, especially when there are important things like buying a house. Rachel took this to heart and ended up in tears, saying that I was being unsupportive and didn’t understand her vision.

In my frustration, I told Rachel that if she continued to focus on the wedding like this, she might end up like those couples who crash and burn after the big day because they never really thought about what comes next. I realized that my comment was harsh, but I felt strongly about the issue.

Since I was the one who organized everything, I took it upon myself to make a detailed spreadsheet of costs and what everyone owed.

As the weekend approached, I realized that I had spent quite a bit more than I had initially anticipated. I had bought all the food and drinks, and while I didn’t mind covering those upfront, I did feel a bit overwhelmed by the costs. I brought it up in our group chat and suggested that we all contribute a little extra for the food, given the amount I had already spent.

When we arrived at the campsite, things started off well, but the first night, one of my friends got a bit too drunk and decided to order pizza for everyone without checking with the rest of us. He ended up charging it to my credit card since I had it on file for the campsite reservations. While I was annoyed, I didn't want to ruin the vibe, so I let it slide and figured we could sort it out later.

Sarah is a bit of a perfectionist and has always had high expectations for Jake, especially when it comes to school. She often critiques his grades and how he handles his homework. Jake, on the other hand, is more laid-back and doesn't take school as seriously as she does.

I invited about ten people, and I made sure to tell everyone that it would be a potluck-style dinner, where everyone could bring a dish to share. I also mentioned that I have a dog who can be a little anxious around large groups of people, so if anyone was allergic to dogs or uncomfortable around them, they should let me know.

About an hour into the night, I saw Jenna’s lasagna on the table and went to grab a slice. As I was serving myself, Mark suddenly stood up and shouted, “Can you please keep your dog away from my food?” This caught everyone off guard, including me. I tried to explain that my dog was just being friendly and that I’d make sure he didn’t get close to the food, but Mark continued to complain loudly, drawing attention to himself.

They wanted to listen to their own playlist instead, which was mostly filled with genres I’m not really into. I tried to compromise by suggesting we could alternate songs, but they were adamant that we only listen to their selection. This led to a pretty intense argument where we both said some hurtful things. I ended up calling them stubborn and they said I was being controlling about the music.

After that, things were really tense between us. Instead of just dropping it, I started joking about how I’d rather listen to the sound of the wind than their terrible music. I thought it would lighten the mood, but they didn’t take it well and said I was being a jerk. I felt defensive and told them they were being overly sensitive. 

Now, with the trip coming up soon, we’re both really unsure about how to move forward. I feel like I was just trying to stand my ground, but I also regret making jokes at their expense. I’m worried that I might have ruined our trip even before it started, and I can't tell if I’m in the wrong or if they overreacted.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I (16F) have this long-time friend named Mark (17M). We’ve been friends since elementary school, and while we’ve always been close, we've never crossed the line into dating territory. Recently, Mark started showing interest in a girl named Sarah (16F) from our school.

The issue began when Mark asked me for advice on how to ask Sarah out. I was supportive and gave him some tips. However, a few days later, he told me he wanted to ask her out at lunch in front of everyone. I thought that was a bit too much pressure for both him and Sarah, so I suggested he do it more privately to avoid any embarrassment if she said no.

Mark got defensive and said that I was trying to sabotage him. I didn’t mean to come off that way, but I felt like he was being reckless. I ended up getting really frustrated and snapped at him, saying, ""You’re not even thinking about how she might feel. You’re just trying to show off in front of your friends!"" 

That wound up hurting his feelings, and he stormed off, saying I was being unsupportive. I felt bad afterward and tried to explain that I just wanted him to be considerate, but he wouldn’t listen. I also told him that maybe he should consider if he really liked Sarah or if he just wanted to impress people.

Now I’m wondering if I was too harsh. I did apologize to him, but he’s still upset. AITA for overreacting to Mark's plans with Sarah? 

Edit: I appreciate the feedback, and I realize now that I could have handled things more tactfully. Mark and I are still not on great terms, but I reached out to him again to try and mend things.",272,2444,0.68,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_62828,2021-06-06 00:00:00,ESH,1585,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Backstory: I live in a small town where everyone knows each other, and the local diner is the go-to place for breakfast. I often go there to get my morning coffee and catch up with friends. 

Event that I am questioning if I am an asshole: A few days ago, I was at the diner when a new waitress started. I noticed she was struggling to keep up with the orders and seemed a bit overwhelmed. While I waited for my food, I overheard her asking a coworker for help, but he just shrugged her off and continued chatting with his friends. I felt bad for her and decided to step in. 

I called her over and said, “Hey, it looks like you could use some help. Do you want me to help you with anything?” She seemed grateful and asked if I could help refill drinks. As I got up to help, I joked with her about how I should just take over the whole place since they clearly needed it. I thought I was being light-hearted, but looking back, maybe it came off as patronizing.

While I was pouring coffee, I accidentally spilled some on the counter. The waitress looked at me with a mix of surprise and frustration, and I felt embarrassed. I quickly cleaned it up, but I noticed she was upset. To make things worse, I overheard the other staff laughing about how I was “playing waitress.” I thought they were being rude about it, and I called them out for their lack of support for the new girl.

Later, as I left the diner, I overheard the waitress telling someone that she didn’t need help from customers and that it made her feel belittled. I felt terrible; I only wanted to help her out.

Everyone sucks here,"I live in a small apartment building where I share a communal laundry room with a few other tenants. There’s one neighbor, Lisa, who seems to always be using the machines at the worst times. I often have to wait for her to finish because she’ll put her laundry in and leave for hours, even when there’s a sign that says to remove clothes promptly.

Honestly, it annoys me to no end. I’ve tried talking to her politely about it, but she just brushes me off, saying she’s busy and will be back when she can. I understand everyone has a life, but it feels unfair when I’m waiting around for my turn.

So, I decided to take matters into my own hands. Instead of waiting, I started running my laundry late at night when I knew she wouldn’t be there. The only problem is that I’m not the only one who stays up late. Other neighbors have complained about the noise from my washing machine and the dryers.

When Lisa found out I was using the machines at odd hours, she confronted me, and we ended up having a heated argument. I told her she needed to be more considerate about taking her clothes out on time, and she accused me of being rude for using the machines when I knew she had been waiting too. 

Now, everyone in the building is irritated with both of us. I guess I feel justified for wanting to use the laundry machines, but I also realize that my late-night laundry sessions disturbed others too.

Everyone sucks here,"I grew up in a pretty chaotic household where emotions ran high, and my parents often argued about everything from finances to parenting styles. Because of that, I promised myself I would be different when I had kids. I really tried to foster a calm environment for my two daughters, ages 8 and 10. I thought I was doing a great job until recently when my husband pointed out that I was being too lenient.

He's more of a disciplinarian, and he believes routines and rules are crucial for kids to learn responsibility. I tend to let things slide, and I try to focus on the positives instead of punishing them for mistakes. For example, when the girls forgot to clean up their toys after playing, I’d just remind them nicely and help them clean up. My husband, on the other hand, thinks that if they don’t do it, they should face some consequences, like losing screen time.

We had a huge argument about this last week when I found out my younger daughter had been lying about finishing her homework. I was upset but decided to talk to her calmly. My husband walked in, overheard the conversation, and completely lost it. He yelled at both of us, saying that my permissiveness was teaching them that lying is okay. He wanted to take away their tablets for a week as punishment.

I felt like he was overreacting, and I stood my ground, saying that they needed guidance, not punishment. I thought I was showing my daughter how to communicate and resolve conflicts without fear. The situation escalated, and we ended up arguing in front of the kids, which I know is not ideal.

In the end, we both had to apologize to our daughters for our behavior, but the whole incident left me feeling torn. I genuinely believe I have good intentions, but I also see my husband’s point about needing structure. It’s clear that we’re both struggling to find a balance between discipline and understanding. So, AITA for wanting to be more empathetic while also acknowledging that maybe I’ve gone too far in the other direction? Or is my husband the one being too strict?

Recently, we all went out for dinner, and during the meal, Jake made a comment about Sarah's job, joking that she must be bad at it because she always complains about it. Sarah laughed it off at first, but I could see it bothered her. Afterward, I confronted Jake about it, saying that his jokes were crossing a line and that he should be more respectful.

Jake got defensive and said he was just joking, and it was all in good fun. I told him that if he cares about me and my relationship, he should reconsider how he talks to her. This led to a heated argument where Jake accused me of being overly sensitive and not being able to take a joke. I ended up raising my voice, and Sarah was visibly upset by the whole situation.

Later that night, I tried to apologize to Sarah for the fight and explained that I was just trying to defend her, but she felt that I should have handled it differently and not escalated things with Jake. Meanwhile, Jake texted me, saying I embarrassed him and he felt like I betrayed him in front of my girlfriend.

Everyone sucks here,"Throwaway account because my partner knows my main.

My partner and I have been together for about two years. I’m really into fitness and working out, and I have a pretty strict routine that I stick to. My partner, on the other hand, is more laid-back about exercise and prefers to go for walks and do yoga when they feel like it.

Recently, I signed up for a half marathon and have been training hard for it. I’ve been waking up early to run and lift weights, and I wanted my partner to join me sometimes for motivation. I thought it would be a great way for us to bond and spend time together. They tried a few times, but they didn’t enjoy the intense workouts, and I could tell they were feeling pressured to keep up with me. 

A couple of weekends ago, we were supposed to go for a long run together, but my partner said they wanted to take it easy and just walk instead. I was frustrated because I wanted to stick to my training plan, and I felt like they were holding me back. I ended up snapping at them, saying that if they weren’t going to put in the effort, then they shouldn’t even bother joining me. My partner was hurt and ended up going for a solo walk, which made me feel guilty.

The next day, I apologized for my outburst, but I also expressed that I wanted them to take fitness more seriously, like I do. They took this as me criticizing their lifestyle choices, and things got a bit heated. We spent the next few days not really talking about it but both feeling off. Finally, we agreed to sit down and discuss it. 

During our talk, my partner admitted that they felt inadequate when I talked about my training and that it made them not want to participate with me at all because they felt like they could never measure up. I realized that I had been pushing too hard and not respecting their boundaries. I told them I was sorry for being so intense and that I didn’t mean to make them feel that way.

However, I also expressed that I wished they would try to meet me halfway in terms of fitness. They felt that my expectations were too high and said that maybe I should just accept them for who they are instead of wanting them to change. 

In the end, we both realized we were at fault for not being more understanding of each other’s perspectives. We talked it out, but I still feel uneasy about how we handled the situation. AITA?",385,1107,0.75,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_88605,2018-11-16 00:00:00,ESH,2354,AITA

Recently, my friend started dating someone new, and I could tell she was really into him. At first, I tried to be supportive, but as time went on, the constant updates about their relationship increasingly made me feel uncomfortable. I had a crush on her a few years back, and though I had moved on, hearing about her new relationship stirred up old feelings that I thought I’d buried.

One evening, we were hanging out, and she started talking enthusiastically about her dates with this new guy. I could feel myself getting more and more withdrawn, and eventually, I snapped and told her that I didn’t want to hear about her dating life anymore because it made me feel bad. I thought I was just being honest about my feelings, but she got really upset and accused me of being selfish and trying to control the conversation.

In the heat of the moment, I fired back that she was being inconsiderate for not recognizing my discomfort, especially knowing my history with unrequited feelings for her. I also said something like, ""How would you feel if I constantly talked about how great my love life was while you were single?"" It was a low blow, and I immediately regretted saying it.

She's the kind of person who tends to overthink everything and gets really upset about small issues. I try my best to support her, but sometimes it feels like I can’t do anything right.

A week ago, Sarah was really anxious about a presentation she had to give for work. She kept texting me about how nervous she was and how she thought she would mess it up. I listened to her and reassured her, but I also suggested that she practice her presentation out loud to build confidence. Unfortunately, I made a comment about how she was overreacting a bit, given that she had prepared well. I thought it might help her to see things more objectively, but she took it really badly and said I didn't understand her feelings.

Recently, Jess started dating this guy, Mark (18M), who is super nice but doesn’t fit in with our friend group as well as she does. He’s quiet and a bit shy, so when we all hang out, he often just sits back and lets Jess take the spotlight. Jess has been really into their relationship, but it’s also changed her a bit; she gets defensive about him and often dismisses our concerns when we mention how he feels left out.

One night, we were all hanging out at my place, and Jess was going on and on about how great Mark is, while he just sat there awkwardly. I could see he was uncomfortable, so I decided to lighten the mood and made a joke about how he should teach Jess how to share the spotlight. Jess didn’t take it well; she snapped at me and accused me of trying to make her look bad in front of him. I thought she was overreacting, but I apologized anyway.

Meanwhile, I felt a bit guilty because I did throw away his stuff without really giving him a chance to clean it up. But I justified it by thinking that sometimes you need to take a stand for the sake of the group.

To complicate matters, Emily got involved and said that both Jake and I were being unreasonable. She felt I should have communicated better, but also that Jake needed to step up and take responsibility for his mess. 

Now, we’re in this stalemate where Jake doesn’t want to speak to me, and Emily is mediating our discussions, trying to keep the peace.

Everyone sucks here,"This happened last summer when I was 25 years old.

I work at a local coffee shop, and we have a regular who comes in almost every day. Her name is Lisa, and she’s a bit of an older lady, maybe in her late 60s. She's always friendly but has a tendency to chat a lot, which has been fine for the most part. However, she often talks about her health issues, family drama, and other personal matters for longer than I’d like during busy hours.

One day, she came in during the afternoon rush when we were slammed with customers. I was trying to serve people quickly and keep things moving. Lisa, as usual, ordered her usual latte and then started her usual lengthy story about her recent doctor visits. I was trying to be polite, but I was stressed and overwhelmed with the line of customers behind her.

I politely told her, “I’m really busy right now, can we talk about this later?” She looked a bit taken aback but shrugged it off and sat down with her drink. However, the line continued to grow, and I felt my irritation rising. I made a bit of a snarky comment to a coworker, saying, “If I wanted to hear someone ramble on about their ailments, I would’ve become a doctor.”

A couple of days later, Lisa came back and seemed a bit colder towards me. I felt guilty but also annoyed. I decided to confront her and told her that it’s hard to chat when I’m working and that I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings. She responded that she just wanted to share her life with someone and felt like I didn’t appreciate her.

Looking back, I realized I was overwhelmed and could have handled the situation better. I also think Lisa could have picked a better time to share her stories. 

So, am I the asshole for telling her I was busy and making that comment about her stories?",607,2713,0.89,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_51246,2022-10-09 00:00:00,ESH,1766,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, recently I (27M) had an argument with my sister (25F) that escalated pretty quickly. We're both pretty opinionated, and while we usually get along, we often clash when it comes to our family gatherings. 

Last week, we had a family dinner at our parents’ house to celebrate our mom’s birthday. I was excited to see everyone, but as soon as I arrived, I noticed my sister was already in a heated discussion with our cousin about politics. I generally try to avoid those kinds of debates, especially during family events, but I couldn’t help overhearing.

At some point, I joined the conversation to share my perspective, thinking it would be a good way to engage. However, my sister and I ended up going back and forth, raising our voices. Considering the atmosphere, I should have calmed down, but I was feeling pretty passionate about my stance. It didn't help that our cousin kept encouraging us, which fueled the fire even more.

After a while, our parents tried to diffuse the situation, but it was clear both my sister and I were too stubborn to let it go. I finally snapped and accused her of being closed-minded and only wanting to argue for the sake of it. She shot back with some personal jabs about my career choices, saying I was wasting my potential, which really struck a nerve. 

Things got awkward, and our parents ended up having to separate us, which made everyone else uncomfortable. I felt bad for ruining the birthday dinner and definitely could have handled my temper better. My sister could have also chosen her words more carefully instead of attacking me personally. 

So, I’m just wondering if I was in the wrong for engaging in the argument, or if she shares some blame for escalating things to a personal level. ESH?",924,1610,0.86,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_97275,2018-08-10 00:00:00,ESH,1747,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My friend (M/24) and I (F/26) have been close for about five years. Recently, he has been going through a tough time with his job and personal life. He’s been feeling really stressed and has started to withdraw from social activities. I’ve tried to be supportive, but I also have my own life and responsibilities, including work and other friendships.

A few weeks ago, I invited him to a gathering at my house, hoping to help lift his spirits. He agreed but then canceled last minute, citing that he wasn't feeling up to it. I understood but expressed my disappointment. This has happened a few times now, where he either cancels or shows up late without a good reason.

Last week, I had planned a small get-together for my birthday, and I invited him as well. A day before the party, I texted him to confirm he was coming. He replied that he was too busy with work and wouldn’t make it. I felt hurt because I had really hoped to celebrate with him. I decided to go ahead and post a photo of the party on social media, tagging all the friends who came, including some funny moments.

Later, he commented on my post, saying he felt excluded and that it hurt him to see everyone together without him. I felt frustrated because I had invited him multiple times and he chose not to come. In a moment of anger, I responded that he can’t expect to be included if he keeps blowing us off. He called me selfish for not understanding what he’s going through and accused me of being a bad friend.

Now, I feel like we both crossed a line. I was hurt and lashed out, and he’s clearly struggling and not handling things well. I wish I could have been more understanding, but I also wanted him to know that his actions have consequences.

She’s a successful lawyer, while I’ve been trying to build my freelance graphic design business. Recently, my sister got a big promotion and threw a celebration dinner at her house, inviting the whole family and her close friends. 

I was excited for her but also a bit envious. During the dinner, the conversation turned to her achievements, and everyone was praising her. I decided to share some of my recent work, thinking it might be nice to get some recognition too. However, instead of a supportive reaction, my sister immediately dismissed my work, saying that graphic design is just a hobby and not a real career. 

Feeling hurt and frustrated, I kind of snapped back and said that at least I’m not working 80 hours a week just to impress my boss. The atmosphere soured quickly, and my sister got upset, saying I was ruining her celebration. I felt justified because I was just trying to defend my work, but I could tell I crossed a line.

Everyone sucks here,"This is a bit complicated, so I’d appreciate any insights or advice on how to handle this situation. Throwaway because I want to keep this private.

A few months ago, my best friend, Lisa, lost her father to a sudden illness. It was a hard time for her, and I did my best to support her. I would check in regularly, offer to hang out, and just be there for her as she navigated through her grief.

Around the same time, I started dating someone new, Jake. He’s wonderful, and we quickly developed a strong connection. Lisa knew about Jake, and I invited her to join us on a few outings, hoping it would lift her spirits. However, after a few times, she told me she felt uncomfortable being around us, especially since she wasn’t ready to move on from her loss.

I completely understood her feelings and tried to be considerate, but I also really liked Jake and wanted to enjoy our time together. So, I started hanging out with Jake more frequently without Lisa. I figured she needed her space, and I didn’t want to push her.

Not long after, I ended up spending a weekend away with Jake, and I posted some pictures on social media. When Lisa saw them, she got upset and confronted me, accusing me of forgetting about her and only thinking of myself. She said I was being insensitive to her situation and that I should have put her feelings first, especially since her father had just passed away.

I tried to explain that I was still there for her, but I also have my own life and happiness to consider. We ended up having a huge argument, and it got pretty heated, with both of us saying things we regretted. I felt that I was justified in wanting to enjoy my new relationship, but I also understood that she was hurting.

In the aftermath, we both cooled off, but the tension remains. I’ve been feeling guilty about how things turned out, and I wonder if I should have prioritized our friendship over my relationship. 

So, am I the asshole for wanting to move on with my life while she’s still grieving, or is she being unreasonable for expecting me to put my happiness aside? ESH? I just want to figure out how to repair our friendship. Thank you for reading.",683,1204,0.77,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_51855,2020-11-03 00:00:00,ESH,2163,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I (32M) have a sister (30F) who has always been somewhat impulsive with her finances. She tends to make big purchases without consulting anyone, especially when it comes to her kids. Recently, she decided to throw a huge birthday party for her son, who just turned 5. She wanted it to be the “event of the year” and mentioned hiring a bouncy castle, a magician, and ordering a ton of food.

I thought it was excessive. I love my nephew, but I suggested she tone it down a bit and stick to a smaller gathering with just family and a couple of friends. I even offered to help her organize a backyard barbecue instead. She brushed off my suggestion, insisting that her son deserved a special day.

A week before the party, I learned that she had maxed out her credit card to pay for everything, and on top of that, she asked our parents for more money. I felt frustrated and worried about her financial decisions. I told her I thought she was being irresponsible and that it wasn’t fair to put that financial burden on our parents.

She got defensive, saying it was her money to spend and she just wanted her son to be happy. I responded that happiness shouldn’t come at the cost of getting into debt. This led to a heated argument, and she accused me of being unsupportive and out of touch with what kids want these days.

The day of the party, I went over, and it turned out to be a chaotic mess. The kids were running wild, there was food everywhere, and the magician was late. I felt bad for my sister, but I couldn’t help but think if she had listened to me, it could have been a lot more manageable.

We ended up arguing again during the cleanup because I pointed out how poorly the whole day had gone and how much easier it would have been if she had just scaled back. She called me a buzzkill and told me I didn’t understand her desire to create memories for her son.

Now, we’re both feeling hurt and resentful, and I can’t help but think we both fueled this situation. I acted harshly about her spending, and she disregarded my advice.

One of my friends, Sarah, mentioned how she loved classic films, particularly those from the Golden Age of Hollywood. I joked that I couldn’t stand old movies because they were too slow and boring for me. 

This led to a bit of a debate, where I made some sarcastic comments about how film “has come a long way” and how “no one wants to watch a three-hour black-and-white snooze-fest.” I could tell Sarah was getting a bit upset, and she tried to explain why those films were significant and how they influenced modern cinema. 

Instead of listening, I kept interrupting her, insisting that I’d rather watch something with action and special effects. Eventually, Sarah snapped and told me that I was being disrespectful to filmmakers who had worked hard to create those classics. I shot back with a snarky comment about how some of those “masterpieces” should stay in the past. 

The atmosphere in the room got tense, and other friends chimed in saying that I was being rude for mocking something that someone else loved. I felt defensive, thinking they were overreacting, but I also realized I might have taken it too far with my comments.

I noticed that one of our friends, Jake, has been bringing his new girlfriend, Emily, around lately. I hadn't met her yet, so I was curious to see how she fit in with our group.

When we all gathered at Sarah's, I noticed that Emily didn’t really engage much with anyone. She seemed shy, and I tried to make conversation with her a couple of times, but she just gave short answers. At one point, I jokingly said, “Don’t worry, we don’t bite. Well, maybe just Jake!” I meant it lightheartedly, but Emily’s face fell, and Jake looked visibly annoyed.

As the night went on, I noticed that Emily was still pretty quiet, so I tried again. I asked her about her interests, and she casually mentioned that she loves cooking. Trying to keep the conversation going, I said, “Oh, so you’ll take over next time Sarah invites us over, right?” I thought it was a fun comment, but Emily didn’t laugh, and Jake snapped at me, saying I was being rude.

I felt taken aback. I didn’t think my comments were that bad, but I apologized anyway, thinking I might have crossed a line. However, Sarah later told me that Emily had been anxious about meeting new people, and my jokes hadn’t helped. I explained to Sarah that I didn’t mean to upset her, but I felt like Jake was overreacting.

After the dinner, I ended up feeling frustrated by the whole situation. I didn’t mean any harm, but I also understand that I could have been more considerate.

Event that I am questioning if I am an asshole: Recently, we had a team meeting to present our latest campaign ideas. During the meeting, one of my employees, Jake, presented his concept, which I felt was not well thought out and lacked originality. Instead of giving constructive feedback, I bluntly said, ""This idea is just a rehash of what we did last year and doesn't bring anything new to the table.""

Jake looked visibly upset, and the atmosphere in the room became tense.

Later that day, I got into a discussion with another team member, Sarah, about the importance of holding each other accountable for our work. I mentioned that sometimes being blunt is necessary to drive progress. Sarah disagreed and felt that I should have been more supportive, especially since Jake is relatively new to the team and still finding his footing.

I had my laptop out and was focused on my tasks when a group of three college students sat down at the table next to mine. They were loud and animated, clearly enjoying their time together, but their conversation quickly shifted to me.

At first, I tried to ignore them, but they started making comments about my clothes and how I looked “like I just rolled out of bed.” I’ll admit, I was wearing my comfy sweats and a hoodie because I wanted to be casual while working. After a few minutes of this, I finally snapped.

I turned to them and said, “You know, if you’re going to sit here and talk about people, maybe try not to look like you just walked out of a frat party.” They looked taken aback, and one of them shot back that I was just jealous of their youth and style. 

Things escalated quickly. I said some pretty harsh things about their generic outfits — I mean, how many hoodies and jeans can one group wear? They retaliated by calling me a “middle-aged loser” and saying I’d never know what “real fun” was like. 

A few people around us started to notice the commotion, and I realized it was getting out of hand. Instead of backing down, I continued pointing out how ridiculous it was to judge someone based on their appearance when they were all dressed almost exactly the same. They got angrier, and it turned into an embarrassing shouting match.

Eventually, I just packed up my stuff and left, feeling like a fool. I know I shouldn’t have engaged with them in the first place, but I let my annoyance get the best of me.

I thought it was sweet of her, but I didn't ask her to contribute.

When she arrived, she brought this huge pot of pasta, which looked delicious, but it was more than enough for the whole group. I thanked her for it, but when I started serving dinner, I noticed that it quickly became the main attraction. Everyone dug into her pasta and barely touched my food.

I felt a little hurt and overshadowed, and I ended up feeling like my celebration was being taken over by her dish. I snapped at her, saying that it was my party and I had planned everything, so maybe people could appreciate the effort I put in instead of only going for her food.

The main issue is the kitchen. I cook most of our meals, and I always try to clean up after myself immediately. However, my partner has a habit of leaving dirty dishes in the sink for a day or two, sometimes even letting them pile up. I’ve expressed my frustration about this, as I find it unsightly and it starts to smell.

As we sat around the dinner table with our parents, things started off lighthearted, but soon the conversation shifted to current events, including recent protests and government policies.

At one point, I disagreed with her approach and suggested that her ideas, while idealistic, might not be realistic in the current political climate. I mentioned that her views might be influenced by her living in a big city, where things can feel very different than in smaller towns. I didn't mean to offend her, but I could see her face drop at my comment.

The group was welcoming, and I enjoyed discussing books and getting to know everyone. There was one member, Sarah, who was particularly friendly and we hit it off, often staying behind after meetings to chat.

In an attempt to lighten the mood and make her feel included, I jokingly mentioned how Sarah and I had been having such a great connection and that it was almost like we were the stars of the show.

The next week, I overheard some coworkers talking about how I was rude to Tom, and they thought I should apologize. I felt bad, but I also justified my actions by thinking that he wouldn’t stop talking about basketball. I didn’t end up apologizing, but I avoided Tom afterward.

Later, I found out that Tom had been feeling really isolated since he started, and my comments added to that. I didn’t realize how much he was relying on sports as a way to connect with others. Now I feel guilty for not considering his feelings.

So, AITA for snapping at Tom, or was he being inconsiderate by only wanting to talk about sports?",775,1028,0.92,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_60992,2020-08-04 00:00:00,ESH,1743,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My brother Mark and I have always had a bit of a rivalry, especially when it comes to our kids. His daughter Lily is a year older than my son Ethan, and while Ethan is a bright kid with a love for sports, Lily is incredibly gifted academically and has been getting straight A's for years.

Recently, Mark organized a family gathering to celebrate Lily's achievements, which included a scholarship to a prestigious university. He invited everyone, and of course, everyone was raving about how amazing Lily is. I was happy for her, but it was hard to hear him constantly bragging while Ethan was struggling a bit in school. He’s had some issues with focusing, and although he works hard, his grades aren’t great.

At the gathering, I overheard Mark telling a family member that he was concerned about Ethan’s future and how it seemed like he wasn’t trying hard enough. This really struck a nerve with me. I felt that Mark was being condescending and unfair, especially considering that he never really seemed to acknowledge the effort Ethan puts in.

Later on, I confronted Mark about his comments. I told him that he was being insensitive and that while I’m proud of Lily, he needs to realize that not every kid can be a straight-A student, and that Ethan is doing the best he can. Mark fired back, saying that if I spent more time helping Ethan with his schoolwork instead of making excuses, maybe he wouldn't be falling behind.

In that moment, I snapped and told Mark that maybe if he spent less time bragging about Lily and more time recognizing her flaws, he’d understand that being perfect isn’t everything. I mentioned how Lily has always had everything handed to her and how he never held her accountable for her bad attitude towards others when she was younger. Mark was furious and stormed off, saying I was just bitter because my kid wasn’t as successful.

I later felt guilty for how I reacted, but I also think Mark crossed a line by criticizing my parenting and making me feel like a failure. When I told my partner about the argument, they pointed out that both Mark and I were being too competitive and that neither of us handled things maturely. I agree, but I still think Mark was out of line.",867,1688,0.89,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_33727,2018-10-24 00:00:00,ESH,2210,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I (22F) recently got into a bit of a situation with my younger sister (18F) over our family vacation plans. Our parents planned a week-long beach trip, and I was really looking forward to it. I love spending time with my family, and it's been a stressful few months for me, so I needed a break.

A few weeks before the trip, my sister came to me, really excited about bringing her new boyfriend along. She told me how much he meant to her and insisted that he should join us. I was initially hesitant because I felt like it was a family vacation and I wasn't sure how I felt about a new boyfriend being part of it. But I didn’t want to be a jerk, so I bit my tongue and said it was fine.

As the trip approached, I started feeling more and more uneasy about it. I felt like the dynamics of the vacation would change with her boyfriend there, and it made me anxious because I wanted to spend quality time with my family, not have to share that time with a stranger. Still, I tried to stay positive. 

The night before we left, my sister casually mentioned that her boyfriend was actually going to stay in my hotel room with me since it was a bigger room. I was taken aback; I didn’t feel comfortable sharing my space with someone I barely knew, especially for an entire week. I told my sister I wasn’t okay with that arrangement and that I needed my own space.

She got really upset and said I was being selfish and ruining her trip. I felt terrible, but I also felt like I had a right to voice my discomfort. In the heat of the moment, I ended up snapping at her and told her it wasn't my fault if she couldn't handle her relationship without dragging him on a family vacation. 

She ended up crying and saying I was ruining her vacation before it even started. Our parents tried to mediate, and while they understood my perspective, they also said I could’ve handled it better. I ended up feeling guilty for how I reacted, but I also think my sister was being a bit unreasonable. 

Now there's tension between us, and I feel bad for how I handled it, but I also feel like she could have respected my boundaries.

Everyone sucks here,"Hello. I live with my partner, Alex, and we've been together for a couple of years. We both have our own hobbies and interests, but lately, I've been feeling really frustrated.

Alex is an avid gamer, and it's not uncommon for them to spend hours on end playing video games, especially on weekends. I don’t mind them gaming, but I've noticed that they're often so engrossed that they neglect our planned activities or even simple chores around the house. 

Last weekend, we had agreed to spend Saturday doing some home improvement projects together. However, as soon as Saturday rolled around, Alex started playing a new game they had been excited about. I tried to be patient, thinking they would stop after a couple of hours. But by late afternoon, they were still glued to the screen.

Feeling ignored and frustrated, I went into the living room and asked Alex if we could please stick to our plans. They shrugged it off, saying they would be ""just a little longer."" At that moment, I lost my cool. I picked up their gaming controller and threw it across the room. I immediately felt terrible, but I was just so fed up with feeling like a second priority.

Alex was understandably upset and yelled at me for being childish and ruining their fun. I apologized but also expressed my frustration about feeling neglected. We ended up arguing, and both of us said some hurtful things. 

Now, we’re both upset with each other, and I’m not sure how to move forward. I feel bad for my actions and I’m not sure if I should have handled it differently.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I recently attended a family gathering at my cousin's house for a holiday celebration. It was a pretty big event with lots of family members, food, and of course, some drama. 

Everything was going smoothly until my aunt, who has a habit of being a bit overbearing, started making comments about my life choices. I’m in my late 20s and still single, and she kept bringing it up, asking when I was going to settle down and start a family. I tried to brush it off politely a couple of times, but she didn't get the hint. 

Feeling frustrated, I finally snapped and told her that maybe she should focus on her own marriage instead of worrying about mine. This led to an awkward silence, and my mom stepped in to defuse the situation, but my aunt was clearly hurt. The rest of the family seemed uncomfortable as well, and I could feel the tension in the room.

Afterward, I felt bad for how I handled it, but I also felt justified because I was tired of her constant probing into my personal life. My aunt later texted me saying that I was rude and that family gatherings shouldn’t be a place for personal attacks. 

Now I’m left questioning if I overreacted or if she deserved it. Am I the asshole for snapping at her, or did she bring it on herself? Everyone is acting a bit weird now, so I feel like maybe we’re all a bit at fault here.",188,976,0.51,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_20203,2020-04-15 00:00:00,ESH,1339,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, I (29F) live in a share house with three other people, and we've been getting along pretty well. However, recently, we had a bit of a situation that escalated. 

About a month ago, one of my housemates, Jake (30M), started dating someone seriously. This new girlfriend, Claire (28F), has been spending a lot of time at our house, which is fine, but she never brings any food or drinks. She mostly just eats what’s in the fridge, and it’s starting to get on my nerves. 

One day, I came home from a long shift and found that she had eaten the last of my leftovers without asking. I was really frustrated, but instead of talking to Jake about it calmly, I decided to confront Claire directly. I told her that it was really unfair to just help herself to my food like that, and that if she wanted to be a frequent guest, she should contribute something. 

Claire got defensive and said it was just food, and that I was being petty. We ended up arguing in the kitchen, and Jake overheard us. He came in and took her side, saying I was being unreasonable and that it was just food and I should relax. This made me really upset because I felt like I was being attacked in my own home.

After the argument, I was still fuming and ended up texting our group chat to vent my frustration about Claire eating my food, saying that I was tired of her entitlement. This didn’t go over well. My other housemates chimed in that they thought I was being a jerk and that I should have handled it differently rather than making it a big deal.

Now, there’s tension in the house. Claire refuses to talk to me, Jake is upset that I brought it to the group chat, and I feel pretty isolated. Honestly, I think we all overreacted in our own ways. 

So, AITA for confronting Claire and then venting to the group chat? Or were we all just out of line?",329,2810,0.71,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_99699,2018-07-20 00:00:00,ESH,1829,AITA

She has been dating her fiancé for a few years, and I’ve never been a fan of him. He can be self-centered and has made some rude comments about our family in the past. Despite this, I’ve always tried to keep my opinions to myself for her sake.

However, when she asked me to be her maid of honor, I felt conflicted. I love her, but I really don't like the idea of supporting someone who has treated our family poorly. I mentioned my concerns to her, and instead of understanding where I was coming from, she got really defensive and claimed I was just trying to ruin her happiness.

In a moment of frustration, I told her I’d gladly be her maid of honor but that I would make a few jokes at the wedding that were aimed at her fiancé, just to make a point about how I felt. I thought it was all in good fun and that it would let her see how I felt without being too harsh, but she was clearly upset when I mentioned it.

Now I’m worried that I’ve crossed a line. I don’t want to ruin her special day, but I also feel like my feelings about her fiancé deserve to be acknowledged. I guess we’re both being a bit unreasonable—she’s not considering my feelings, and I’m threatening to make her wedding uncomfortable.

Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I recently had a heated argument that I’m still trying to process. We've been together for about four years and live together. 

I’m a big fan of cooking and often experiment with new recipes. My partner, on the other hand, tends to be more of a takeout person. Recently, I decided to make a big batch of homemade lasagna because I had some friends coming over for dinner. I spent the entire day prepping, cooking, and baking, which was tiring but also really rewarding.

When my friends arrived, we had a great time eating and chatting. My partner was there too, but he mostly stayed quiet and didn't engage much with my friends. I thought that was fine since he usually prefers to be more reserved in social settings. However, as the night went on, I noticed he was acting a bit off. 

After everyone left, he confronted me about the lasagna. Apparently, he was upset that I didn’t save any for him. I thought he was okay with it because he hadn’t expressed interest in eating it beforehand. He said that he had wanted some, but since he didn’t say anything, I thought it was fine to serve it all to my friends.

In response, I told him that I had spent the whole day making that dinner for my friends and he should have spoken up if he wanted some. This led to a big argument where we both started saying things we didn’t mean. He accused me of being selfish for not considering his feelings, while I accused him of being passive-aggressive and not communicating his needs.

To make matters worse, I discovered that he had eaten the leftovers of some snacks I bought earlier that week, which made me feel like he was being hypocritical for expecting me to save food for him when he didn’t do the same for me. 

Now I’m left feeling guilty about the whole evening and unsure if I handled things poorly. On one hand, I feel like he should have communicated better, but on the other hand, I could have been more considerate about saving him some food. It was a mess and we both ended up hurt.

At first, I tried to be supportive and included her in discussions, but her attitude began to wear on the team. She frequently criticized our existing projects, claiming they were outdated and unoriginal. A couple of times, she even dismissed ideas from long-time employees, suggesting that they were ""stuck in their ways.""

While I was initially excited to have someone new, things quickly became complicated.

From the start, Jamie had a habit of trying to change our entire workflow and the way we communicate with clients. They insisted on ""modernizing"" our approach, which involved a lot of buzzwords and trendy phrases that felt disingenuous to many of us. We tried to be patient, but it felt like Jamie was undermining our established methods without really understanding them.

To make matters worse, Jamie frequently interrupted conversations, often talking over others and cutting in with their opinions, even when it wasn’t their place. This really frustrated the rest of the team, especially during meetings or brainstorming sessions. One day, during a particularly tense meeting, I snapped and told Jamie to let others speak. I didn't say it in the kindest way, and I could see their face fall. It was a heated moment, and I regretted how I handled it afterward.

In retaliation, Jamie started talking to Lisa behind our backs, claiming the team was not being inclusive of their ideas. They also began to subtly exclude me from conversations, which felt incredibly childish. I found out from another coworker that Jamie had even suggested to Lisa that I might not be a good fit for the team, which really stung.

During the outing, Jamie kept turning to her boyfriend for everything, and I felt invisible. Frustrated, I made a sarcastic comment about how I must have been forgotten in the crowd. Jamie's boyfriend didn't take it well and snapped at me, which made the situation even more awkward.

Instead of letting it go, I decided to confront Jamie afterwards. I told her that I was feeling neglected and that it felt like she was prioritizing her boyfriend over our friendship. She got defensive, accusing me of being jealous and unsupportive of her happiness. I ended up raising my voice, and we had a heated argument right in front of her boyfriend and friends, which made things even worse.

Now Jamie is upset with me for ruining the outing, and our friendship feels strained. I regret how I handled the situation, but I still feel hurt by her actions. Was I the asshole for calling her out in front of everyone, or was she out of line for neglecting our friendship?",896,2103,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_51600,2021-01-23 00:00:00,ESH,1863,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I recently went on a weekend trip with a few friends. We had planned this for months, and everyone was really excited. It was supposed to be a fun getaway. Before the trip, we all agreed to split the Airbnb cost equally, and each of us would cover our own food and activities. 

So, we get there, and one friend, Mike, starts insisting that we all go out for dinner on the first night. I thought it was a good idea, but money was a bit tight for me at the moment, so I suggested we order takeout instead. Mike got really upset, claiming that going out was part of the experience and that I was being a buzzkill. I ended up agreeing, but I felt a bit pressured since I didn’t want to ruin the vibe.

Dinner turned into a pretty expensive meal, and when the bill came, Mike volunteered to pay for the whole thing, saying he would cover it and we could just Venmo him later. I figured it would be fine to split it, but when we got the total, it was way more than I expected. I was already feeling stressed about my finances, and I hesitated before sending him the money. 

The next day, I decided to bring it up casually, mentioning that I was a bit shocked by the cost and that next time we should really be more mindful about where we eat. Mike got defensive, saying I should've just spoken up before dinner if I was uncomfortable. I snapped a bit and said maybe if he didn’t have to show off, we could’ve kept it cheaper. 

Afterwards, everyone was awkward, and we didn't enjoy the rest of the trip as much as we could have. I feel bad for how I reacted, but I also feel Mike pushed me into an uncomfortable situation. AITA?",296,2464,0.6,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_25425,2021-07-01 00:00:00,ESH,1624,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My friend and I have been close since high school, and we both share a love for hiking and the outdoors. A few months ago, she invited me on a weekend hiking trip with a group of her friends. I was excited and said yes, but I had a minor injury and was still recovering. I mentioned this to her, but she insisted I should come and that I could take it easy.

The day of the trip, I felt okay enough to go, but I quickly realized I wasn't in good shape for the rigorous hikes they had planned. I struggled to keep up, which made me feel embarrassed and frustrated. Instead of speaking up, I tried to push through, hoping it would get easier. My friend noticed I was lagging behind and kept urging me to keep going, which only made me feel worse.

During one of the hikes, I finally admitted that I was feeling overwhelmed and suggested we take a break. My friend, clearly annoyed, started criticizing me for not being more adventurous and for holding the group back. I snapped back, pointing out that she had pushed me into coming despite my injury and that I was doing my best. The argument escalated, and we both ended up saying hurtful things to each other in front of her friends.

After the trip, she was upset and told me she felt betrayed because I didn't enjoy the trip the way she had hoped. I felt hurt because I believed she should have been more considerate of my condition and how I was feeling. Now, our friendship is strained, and we haven't spoken much since.

Everyone sucks here,"My best friend and I have been close since childhood. Recently, she started dating this new guy, and it seemed like a whirlwind romance. I was supportive at first, but I couldn't shake the feeling that he was bad news. He constantly made snide comments about her weight and appearance, and it was clear to me that he was emotionally manipulating her. 

One night, after a few drinks, I voiced my concerns to her. I told her that I thought he was toxic and that she deserved better. She got defensive and told me I was overreacting, that I didn’t understand their relationship, and that she was happy. I felt like I was trying to look out for her, but maybe I overstepped.

A few weeks later, I was at a party where he also showed up. He was rude to me in front of everyone, making jokes at my expense. I snapped and called him out in front of everyone, telling him to treat her better or get out of her life. The atmosphere got tense, and she ended up storming out with him. 

After that, she didn’t talk to me for a while. I felt bad for losing her trust, but I also felt justified in standing up for her. Eventually, we met up, and she told me that while she appreciated my concern, she didn't want me to meddle in her relationship anymore. I apologized, but I was still upset about how he treated her. 

Now, I’m torn. I feel like I was a good friend by speaking up, but I also realize that I might have made things worse by confronting him publicly.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I (24F) recently had a pretty heated argument with my roommate (26M) about our shared responsibilities around the apartment. We’ve been living together for about a year, and while we get along most of the time, tensions have been building.

We agreed to split chores, but lately, I’ve noticed that I’ve been doing a lot more than he has. I clean the kitchen, take out the trash, and do the laundry, while he often leaves his dirty dishes piled up in the sink for days. I tried to bring it up casually, but he brushed it off, saying he was just busy with work. I get that we both have jobs, but it felt unfair that I was taking on the bulk of the household responsibilities.

One day, after a long week, I snapped. I came home to find his dishes still in the sink, and instead of just cleaning them like I usually do, I took all of his dirty plates and stacked them in his room. I thought it would send a message. Turns out, it did — but not the one I hoped for. He was furious and confronted me about it, accusing me of being passive-aggressive and petty. 

I tried to defend my actions by explaining how overwhelmed I felt, but instead of resolving anything, our argument escalated. We both ended up saying some pretty hurtful things. He called me a ""cleaning Nazi,"" and I told him he was a ""lazy slob."" 

After the fight, I felt bad about how things turned out, but I also felt justified in my frustration. Now, we’re both avoiding each other, and the atmosphere in our apartment is super tense. I guess I thought maybe he would finally step up and help out more, but instead, it just blew up in our faces.

Everyone sucks here,"So I (28M) recently went on a weekend camping trip with a group of friends, including my friend Sarah (27F) who I've known for a few years. We’ve always had a bit of a flirty dynamic, but nothing serious ever came of it, and we just remained friends. 

On the first night of the trip, we set up our campsite, had a nice dinner, and eventually started drinking around the campfire. Everyone was having a great time, and as the night went on, the drinks kept flowing. Sarah was getting pretty tipsy, and I could tell she was starting to let loose a bit more than usual.

At one point, Sarah disappeared with some other friends to go check out a nearby lake. I figured she just wanted to have some fun, so I stayed back with the others. After a little while, I got worried when I noticed she hadn’t come back for a long time. I decided to go look for her.

When I reached the lake, I found her sitting on a log with a couple of guys from our group. They were laughing, and one of them had his arm around her. I felt an immediate surge of protectiveness and a bit of jealousy, thinking about how she might not entirely know what she was doing in her drunken state. So, I approached them and told her it was time to come back to camp.

She got annoyed and said she was having fun and didn’t want to leave. I insisted, saying it was getting late and she shouldn’t be out there alone with those guys. She tried to argue with me, saying she was fine and that I was being overprotective. I told her I was just looking out for her, but she snapped back and said I was being controlling and that she was an adult who could make her own choices.

Eventually, I managed to convince her to come back with me, but she was really upset and the mood of the group was definitely thrown off. Back at camp, she confronted me again, escalating the argument. I felt like I was just trying to do the right thing, but I could also see how I was coming off as bossy and a bit jealous.

Now, I feel like both of us were out of line. I was trying to protect her, but I probably overstepped, and she didn’t handle my interference very well.

Everyone sucks here,"I'm a college student living with three roommates in a small apartment. We all have different lifestyles, and while I try to keep things clean, my roommates have different ideas about cleanliness, especially when it comes to the shared kitchen.

One of my roommates, Alex, is a great cook but tends to leave his dishes piled up in the sink for days. I’ve brought it up several times, and he always says he'll get to it, but it never happens. Another roommate, Jamie, is pretty laid-back and doesn't mind the mess, but I can't focus on my studies when the kitchen looks like a disaster zone.

After weeks of frustration, I decided to take matters into my own hands. One day, when I came home to a sink overflowing with unwashed dishes and food remnants everywhere, I snapped. I put on gloves, gathered all of Alex’s dirty dishes, and dumped them in his room. I also took the trash out, which was overflowing with food wrappers and containers that had gone moldy.

The next day, I put a note on the fridge that read: ""Please clean up after yourselves. I can't live in this mess anymore. Dishes must be washed after use, or they'll be relocated."" I thought this would get the message across.

When my roommates found out what I did, they were furious. Alex was especially angry and said I invaded his personal space by putting his dishes in his room, and Jamie accused me of being overly controlling and not respecting their ways. I tried to explain that living in a clean environment is important for me, but it just turned into a shouting match.

Now it's silent treatment time, and the kitchen is still a mess because neither Alex nor Jamie wants to clean up as a form of protest. I feel guilty for how I handled the situation, but I also feel like they should have respected my need for a cleaner living space.

Everyone sucks here,"My roommate and I have been living together for about a year now. She's generally a chill person, but she's also very social and has a big friend group. The problem is that she often invites her friends over without checking with me first, and it can get a bit overwhelming. I’m more introverted and prefer having quiet evenings at home.

Recently, one of her friends, who I find a bit obnoxious, started coming over frequently and making himself at home. He would leave his stuff everywhere and play loud music, which I found really annoying, especially since I was trying to focus on my studies. I've mentioned to my roommate a couple of times that it bothers me when her friends are over so often, but she brushed it off as just part of living together.

Last week, I reached my breaking point. I came home after a long day, and her friend was there, blasting music and being loud. I snapped and essentially told him to leave, saying something like, “This isn’t a hangout spot for you. You can’t just show up whenever you want.” He was taken aback and left without saying anything.

After that, my roommate was understandably upset. She told me I was out of line and that I should have spoken to her first about how I felt instead of confronting her friend. I felt justified because I was at my wit’s end, but looking back, I realize my approach was pretty harsh.

Now there’s tension between my roommate and her friend, and she’s caught in the middle. She wants to reach out to him to apologize for my outburst, but I told her I don’t think she should. I just wanted him to understand that he couldn’t just treat our place like his hangout spot. 

I’ve apologized to my roommate, but I’m still sticking to the boundary of not wanting her friends over without checking with me first. It’s a messy situation, and I feel bad for how it all turned out. 

Am I the asshole for confronting her friend like that, or was I right to stand up for my space?

Everyone sucks here,"A few weeks ago, I (24F) went out with a group of friends to celebrate one of their birthdays. We had planned a fun night out at a nice restaurant followed by some drinks at a bar. I was excited, but also a bit anxious about the cost since I’m currently saving for a big trip and money has been tight.

When we arrived at the restaurant, I noticed that the prices were higher than I expected. I was feeling a bit uncomfortable about spending so much, but I didn’t want to spoil the mood for everyone else. As we were deciding what to order, I made a light joke about how I could just have a salad and call it a night to save some cash.

One of my friends, Lisa (also 24), laughed but then jokingly said, “Come on, you can’t be that broke! We’re celebrating!” I forced a smile, but it stung a little. I know she didn’t mean anything by it, but it felt like a jab. In a moment of frustration, I snapped back with, “Well, some of us aren’t living off our parents’ money!” 

The table went quiet, and Lisa looked taken aback. I immediately regretted my words, but it was too late. I didn’t mean to hurt her, but I was just so fed up and wanted to defend myself. The rest of the night was awkward, and even though we tried to have fun, you could tell there was tension.

Later that night, she texted me saying that my comment really hurt her feelings and made her feel embarrassed. I could tell she was upset, and I felt guilty for lashing out like that. I didn’t want to be the kind of person who puts down others for their privilege, but I was also frustrated with my financial situation.

In the end, I tried to reach out and apologize, but I think it was too soon. Lisa is still upset, and now I don't know how to navigate our friendship.

Everyone sucks here,"I live in a small apartment complex with shared outdoor space, including a patio area and a grill. I recently moved in and decided to set up a little garden with flowers and herbs in the corner of the patio to brighten up the space. I thought it would be a nice addition for everyone to enjoy.

A few weeks in, I noticed that one of my neighbors, who lives on the same floor, started using some of my pots and soil without asking. At first, I thought it was a one-time thing, but it continued. I confronted her about it, and she argued that since the patio is shared, she has every right to use the space. I explained that I was trying to create a welcoming garden and that I would appreciate her not using my things without permission.

A few days later, I found my flowers trampled and some of my herbs missing. I was furious and left a note on her door expressing my frustration. She responded by saying that I was being possessive over something that should be shared and that I shouldn’t take gardening so seriously. This made me feel guilty, so I decided to apologize for the note, but I also asked her to refrain from using my garden and to respect my space.

Things escalated after that. I ended up venting to a few other neighbors about the situation, and it turned into a small argument between us about boundaries and shared spaces. The neighbors got involved, and some sided with her, saying that I was overreacting, while others agreed that she should have asked before using my stuff.

Recently, I started dating someone new, Ethan, and I was excited to introduce him to my friends.

Last weekend, I invited a few friends, including Jenna, to a dinner party at my place so they could meet Ethan. I was hoping to relax and enjoy the evening, but Jenna seemed to be in a particularly dark mood that night. She dominated the conversation with her struggles, interrupting others and making it hard for Ethan to engage with the group. I felt embarrassed and frustrated because I wanted Ethan to see the fun side of my friends but instead, he witnessed a lot of heavy conversation.

After a while, I decided to speak to Jenna privately. I told her that while I understood she was going through a tough time, it was my night to introduce Ethan, and I felt like she was taking away from that experience. I asked her to try to keep the conversation lighter so that everyone could enjoy the evening.

Jenna reacted very negatively. She accused me of being selfish and not caring about her feelings. I felt hurt that she didn’t understand my perspective, and I snapped back, saying that she always makes everything about her and I needed a break from being her therapist.

So, a few months ago, my friend group decided to plan a weekend trip to the beach. We were all really excited and started making arrangements. We booked a rental house and agreed on who would bring what supplies, and everyone was contributing to the food and drinks.

Now, I’ve been trying to eat healthier and even started meal prepping for myself. I planned to bring my own food to the trip to stick to my goals. I told everyone that I would be bringing my own meals since I didn’t want to stray from my diet.

One of my friends, let’s call her Sarah, has always been a little more laid-back about food. She decided to bring a ton of snacks and junk food for the group, which I knew would be a temptation for me.

When we got to the rental house, I noticed that Sarah had laid out all her snacks on the kitchen counter. To be fair, they did look really good, and I could feel myself craving them. But I stuck to my own meals and tried not to indulge.

Later that night, while we were all hanging out, I made a comment about how it was hard to stay on track with all the junk food around. I didn’t mean to offend anyone, but Sarah got upset. She told me I was being a snob and ruining the fun for everyone. This led to a heated argument where both of us said some hurtful things. I ended up saying I didn’t want to be around “people who don’t care about their health,” which was over the line.

The next day, I felt terrible about what I said, and I tried to apologize, but Sarah was still really upset.

I hesitated because I didn’t want to interrupt her evening if she didn’t want to join us, but in the end, I decided to go outside and ask her directly.

I started cleaning up everything, but instead of just silently washing the dishes, I made a big show of it and kept muttering about how exhausting it was to live with someone who didn’t care about keeping the place clean. I was frustrated and maybe a bit passive-aggressive.

My sister came in while I was cleaning and got upset with me for making her feel bad about the mess. We ended up in a heated argument where we both said hurtful things. She accused me of being controlling, while I told her she was inconsiderate and needed to grow up. 

In the heat of the moment, I overreacted and told her I was going to start charging her for my half of the groceries since I felt like I was doing all the work around the house. It was a ridiculous thing to say, and we both ended up feeling hurt and angry.

Everyone sucks here,"I have a coworker, let’s call her Sarah. We’ve worked together for about three years and have developed a decent friendship. However, we have very different work ethics and ways of handling stress. I'm someone who prefers to stay calm and collected, while Sarah tends to get overwhelmed easily and lashes out when things get tough.

A few months ago, our team was given a huge project with a tight deadline. Sarah was struggling to keep up with her part and started venting to me about her frustrations, including some of our teammates she felt weren’t pulling their weight. I tried to be supportive and encouraged her to communicate with our manager if she felt overwhelmed. I didn’t want to add more stress to the situation, so I didn’t bring it up to anyone else.

As the deadline approached, Sarah began to act increasingly irritable, and I could sense the tension in the office. One day, in a moment of weakness, I overheard Sarah talking badly about another coworker to a group of employees. I felt uncomfortable and brought it up to her later, reminding her that we shouldn’t speak poorly about our colleagues behind their backs. 

Sarah took this as me trying to be a know-it-all and accused me of not understanding how stressful the project was. I got defensive and told her that I knew how stressful it was too and that she needed to take responsibility for her own work instead of blaming others. This escalated into a heated argument where we both said things we regretted. I pointed out some of her past mistakes, and she accused me of being a backstabber.

In the aftermath, we both cooled down but things were different. I felt like I had to re-establish my boundaries, so I became more distant. Sarah, feeling hurt and betrayed, started to gossip about me with some of our other coworkers, which eventually led to more tension in the office.

Looking back, I realize we both acted poorly. I should have handled my concerns more tactfully instead of confronting her directly, and she shouldn’t have vented to others in a damaging way. Our friendship is strained, and the work environment has become awkward as a result of our actions. 

So, AITA for confronting Sarah about her gossiping and then escalating things to the point where we both said hurtful things to each other?",889,2872,0.56,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_51406,2019-03-08 00:00:00,ESH,2291,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, I’m looking for some perspective on a situation that happened between my friend and me, and I’m really wondering if I messed up here.

I (25F) have a close friend, Jess (26F), who has been struggling with her mental health for a while. She recently decided to take a break from work to focus on herself, which I totally support. I’ve been trying to be there for her during this time, calling and texting to check in and offering to hang out when she feels up to it.

Last weekend, I had a small gathering at my place with a few friends. I invited Jess, but she declined, saying she wasn't feeling up to being social. I completely understood and told her that it was okay, but I did mention that I’d miss her. Then, I went ahead with the gathering, and it was a lot of fun—everyone was laughing, talking, and enjoying themselves.

When I shared some pictures from the night on social media, Jess saw them and posted a comment on my photo saying, ""Nice to know you care about my mental health."" I felt a bit blindsided by her comment. In the moment, I responded with a snarky reply, saying something like, ""I can’t help if you choose to isolate yourself."" 

After that, we got into a bit of a back-and-forth where I felt like she was being overly dramatic, and she accused me of being a bad friend for not including her despite knowing what she’s going through. I ended up saying some hurtful things, implying that she needed to stop using her mental health as an excuse to push people away.

Now I feel bad about how things escalated. I didn’t intend to hurt her, but I also felt frustrated because I’ve been so supportive. I think we both crossed some lines in that argument, and now I’m left wondering if I was out of line too.

Everyone sucks here,"A few months ago, I was invited to my friend Sarah's birthday party. Sarah is a great friend, and I was excited to celebrate with her. However, I was a bit tight on cash because I had recently started a new job, and my first paycheck was still a couple of weeks away. I had already committed to buying her a nice gift, which I felt was important since she always gives thoughtful gifts on birthdays.

The party was at a local restaurant where everyone was expected to order food and drinks. To save money, I decided to limit my spending by just getting a small appetizer and a soft drink. When I arrived, I noticed that many of our friends were ordering cocktails and appetizers to share, and the atmosphere was lively.

As we were waiting for the food, Sarah came over to me and said, “Come on, you should get something more! It’s my birthday! I want to celebrate with everyone.” I felt a bit pressured and uncomfortable, but I told her I really couldn’t afford it. I tried to explain my situation, but she insisted that it was her special day and that I should at least indulge a little. I eventually caved, feeling guilty, and ordered a larger meal than I had planned.

Later in the evening, after a few drinks, Sarah suggested we do a group activity that involved buying more food for everyone—something I hadn’t anticipated. I was feeling anxious about how much it would cost, but I didn’t want to ruin her fun. So I ended up chipping in more than I could really afford. After the party, I mentioned to Sarah that I felt uneasy about how things went down, and she snapped back, saying I should just enjoy life more and not be so stingy.

In hindsight, I know I could have stood my ground more firmly about my budget. But I also feel like Sarah was a bit pushy and didn’t respect my financial limitations. Now, there’s a bit of tension between us, and I’m not sure how to approach it. AITA?",325,664,0.6,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_76829,2018-03-13 00:00:00,ESH,1894,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Background: I have a neighbor who has a small dog that tends to bark a lot. It’s particularly noisy in the mornings when I’m trying to get some sleep after working night shifts.

Last week, I was trying to catch up on rest after a long week, and I woke up to the sound of the dog barking like crazy outside. It was early morning, and I was really frustrated. I got out of bed, threw on some clothes, and went outside to see what was going on. I noticed the neighbor was standing in her yard, calling for her dog, who had somehow gotten loose from her leash and was running around.

I could hear her yelling for the dog, and I felt bad for her, but I also wanted to express how disruptive it was for me. Instead of just addressing the situation calmly, I yelled over to her, “Can you please get your dog? Some of us are trying to sleep!” She turned around, surprised, and shot back that she was doing her best and that the dog just got excited. 

In my frustration, I said, “Well, maybe you should keep better control of your dog! This isn't the first time he’s disturbed my sleep!” She responded with some harsh words about how I should mind my own business and that dogs bark. At that point, I raised my voice even more, saying that her dog was a nuisance and that she needed to take responsibility.

Eventually, she managed to catch her dog, but tensions were high, and we both ended up exchanging some rude comments. I felt bad afterward, as I know it’s not easy for her, but I also felt justified in my frustration.

*Edit for clarification*

This took place on a quiet street where we could clearly hear each other. I understand that dogs bark, but I was really at my wit's end.

Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I have been together for about three years, and we recently moved in together. Things were going well until a couple of months ago when we had a major disagreement about how we handle our finances. 

I grew up in a household where budgeting was a strict rule, and I've always been very cautious about spending. My partner, on the other hand, tends to be more laid-back about money. They believe in enjoying life and not stressing too much over every dollar. This difference in our financial philosophies started to create tension, especially when it came to our joint expenses.

A few weeks ago, we had a big discussion about our monthly budget. I suggested we set a strict budget for eating out and entertainment, which my partner felt was overly controlling. I pushed hard on this because I wanted to save for a vacation we've been discussing, and the idea of spontaneous spending made me anxious. My partner got frustrated and accused me of being too uptight and not understanding their need for enjoyment.

In the heat of the moment, I told my partner that if they couldn't be responsible, maybe they shouldn't have access to our joint account. That comment really hurt them, and they said I was being disrespectful and controlling. I felt justified in my frustration, but I realize now that I could have approached the conversation in a more supportive way instead of coming off as controlling.

Then, just last week, my partner decided to go out with friends and spent a significant amount of money that wasn’t in the budget. When they came home, I expressed my concern about it, and we ended up in another argument. I didn't yell or anything, but I was cold and distant, which I know made things worse. My partner said I was ruining our relationship with my constant worrying and nagging about money.

In hindsight, I think we both handled the situation poorly. I could have been more understanding of their perspective and found a middle ground, while they could have been more respectful of my wishes regarding our finances. Now we are both feeling hurt and misunderstood, and it's created a rift between us.

While we were there, Mark started drinking a bit too much and began making some crude jokes about women, which made a few of us uncomfortable. At one point, he made an inappropriate comment about a waitress who was just doing her job, and I felt like I had to say something. I pulled him aside and told him that his comments were disrespectful and that he needed to tone it down.

Mark didn't take it well. He got defensive and accused me of being overly sensitive. I tried to explain that it wasn't just about me, but that it was about treating people with respect. He brushed me off and went back to the group, continuing with his jokes. I ended up feeling frustrated and embarrassed because I thought I was trying to stand up for what was right.

Later in the night, Mark ended up getting kicked out of the bar for being too rowdy, and he texted me that it was all my fault for ruining the night.

I’m a 28-year-old female, and my boyfriend, Jake, is 30. We’ve been together for about two years. Jake has a close-knit group of friends, and his best friend, Tom, is the one whose birthday we were celebrating. The issue we ran into involves Tom's girlfriend, Lisa, who I’ve never gotten along with.

From the start, Lisa has been confrontational and rude to me, making snide remarks and trying to undermine me in front of Jake and their friends. I tried to be civil for Jake's sake, but it was becoming increasingly difficult. At the party, things escalated when she made a comment about my outfit, saying I looked like I was trying too hard. I snapped and told her that at least I put effort into how I looked, unlike her, who always looks like she just rolled out of bed.

This led to a huge argument. Tom got involved, trying to defend Lisa, and Jake was stuck in the middle. Both of us ended up shouting at each other, and eventually, Tom asked us to take it outside. I was furious and felt humiliated, but I knew I was partially to blame for letting my anger get the best of me.

While we were outside, I told Jake that I was done trying to be nice to someone who clearly didn’t like me and that I wasn’t going to continue pretending. Jake said he understood but thought I could have handled it better. We went back inside, but the atmosphere was extremely tense, and most guests were awkwardly silent.

I responded by saying that I was just trying to lighten the mood and that she should learn to take a joke. A few days later, she unfriended me on social media, which hurt because I valued our friendship.

Now, I realize that I could have handled the situation better by being more considerate of her feelings. On the other hand, I think she was a bit too sensitive about the joke.

Everyone sucks here,"I've always had a rocky relationship with my sister. She's six years younger than me and has always been the favorite among our parents.

I was happy for her, but I couldn't shake off the feelings of envy and frustration. I tried to put a smile on, but I ended up making a sarcastic comment about how all their attention was just a little too much. My parents didn’t take it well, and my sister looked hurt, but I didn’t want to feel ignored again.

During the party, my sister gave a speech about how grateful she was for everyone’s support, and I decided to interrupt her with a joke about how maybe next time they could celebrate my achievements. It was meant to be lighthearted, but it came off as bitter. My sister got visibly upset, and my parents scolded me in front of everyone, telling me I should be more supportive.

Afterwards, my sister confronted me privately, saying I ruined her special day and that I need to get over my jealousy. I snapped back that maybe if our parents showed me some respect, I wouldn’t feel this way. The argument escalated, and she ended up crying.

I feel bad for ruining her party and for the way I reacted, but I also think it’s unfair that my feelings were dismissed, and I was called out in front of everyone.

Everyone sucks here,"Okay, here goes:

So, I (28M) have a younger brother, Jake (21M), who is currently in his last year of college. He’s had a rough time adjusting to the demands of his coursework and has been struggling with mental health issues, which I’ve tried to support him through. Recently, he came to me asking for help with his finances. He was short on rent because he’s been spending more money than he should on going out with friends and ordering takeout instead of cooking.

I offered to help him out, but I set a condition: he needed to start budgeting and tracking his expenses more carefully. I also suggested he cut back on unnecessary spending, like eating out and partying. I thought this was reasonable, given that he’s an adult and needs to learn financial responsibility.

Instead of taking my advice to heart, he got really defensive and accused me of not understanding his situation. He argued that college is a time for enjoyment and that he shouldn’t have to restrict himself so much. This led to a heated argument where I told him that he needs to grow up and face the consequences of his decisions. I may have come off as harsh, and I regret how I spoke to him.

After our argument, I felt bad and reached out to apologize, but he hasn’t responded. Meanwhile, I’ve been venting to my friends about the situation, which has turned into me making some unkind comments about his maturity and priorities.

So, in a way, I feel like I’m being supportive while also being frustrated with him, and I know I could have handled it better. But I also think he needs to take some real responsibility for himself.

Everyone sucks here,"My brother (30) and I (28) have always had a complicated relationship. Growing up, my parents favored him because he was the “golden child.” He was smart, athletic, and outgoing, while I often felt overlooked and overshadowed by him. Despite this, I always tried to be supportive and celebrate his achievements, even if they stung a little.

Recently, my brother got engaged to his long-time girlfriend, who is a lovely person. While I was genuinely happy for them, I also felt a twinge of jealousy creeping in. My brother’s wedding plans started to take over his life, and he became a bit of a bridezilla. He had a lot of opinions about how everything should go, and he started to expect everyone to drop everything to help him with the planning.

During this time, I was also going through a tough patch in my own life. I had just lost my job and was dealing with some personal issues. I didn't have the energy to help him with every little detail, and when I communicated that to him, he became furious. He accused me of being selfish and not supporting him during one of the most important times in his life.

Instead of trying to have a mature conversation, I snapped back. I told him that maybe if he wasn't so self-absorbed, he would realize that not everyone shares his enthusiasm for the wedding planning. I also brought up how our parents have always treated him like the favorite, and how it felt like he never acknowledged my struggles. 

This led to a huge blow-up where we both said things we didn't mean. He called me a failure, and I told him that he was an arrogant jerk who wouldn’t last a day in the real world without the support of our parents. After that fight, we didn’t speak for a couple of weeks, and I felt guilty for not being there for him during what was supposed to be a joyful time.

Eventually, I reached out to apologize for my comments about him being arrogant, but I still felt he owed me an apology for his insults too. He refused, saying that he was too busy and that I needed to just get over myself. Now there’s this lingering tension between us. I feel bad for how I reacted, but I also think he was being unreasonable and demanding.

When we first moved in together, we established a loose system for dividing chores. I usually take care of cooking and grocery shopping, while my partner handles the cleaning and laundry. This has worked for the most part, but I've noticed my partner has been slacking on their responsibilities lately. 

It's not just the cleaning; it seems like they’re often too absorbed in their hobbies or work to contribute. I’ve tried to bring it up several times, but every time I do, my partner gets defensive and says that they work hard and deserve to relax when they’re home. I can understand their point, but I feel like I also work hard and shouldn’t have to pick up all the slack.

Last week, I finally snapped and confronted them about it. During a heated argument, I told them they were being selfish for not helping more around the house. My partner retaliated by calling me controlling and accusing me of being dramatic. In the heat of the moment, I said some hurtful things, which I regret. 

Afterward, we both cooled down and apologized, but the tension still lingers. I feel like I might have overreacted, but I also think my partner needs to step up and take their share of the responsibilities.

So, I've been friends with Mark for about five years. We met in college and have always had a fun, supportive friendship. Recently, Mark started dating Sarah, and they've been together for a few months. I was excited for him because he seemed really happy, and I wanted to welcome her into our friend group.

A few weeks ago, we planned a small gathering at my place to celebrate Mark's birthday. I invited a few close friends, including Sarah. The day of the party, I texted Mark to confirm what he wanted for dinner, and he mentioned that Sarah is quite health-conscious and suggested we stick to a vegan menu since it would make her comfortable. I thought that was fair enough, so I agreed.

However, as the evening went on, I noticed that Sarah was kind of dismissive towards my other friends' dietary preferences. When they expressed wanting to have some pizza or wings, she rolled her eyes and made comments about how they should be more mindful of their choices for the planet. It rubbed me the wrong way, especially since I was trying to accommodate her.

After some awkward moments, I finally snapped and told her to lighten up a bit and that it was just a birthday party, not a lecture on veganism. Mark got upset and said I was being rude to his girlfriend. I felt bad for snapping, but I also thought she was being overly judgmental. I ended up apologizing to both of them, but I still think Sarah was out of line.

Everyone sucks here,"Honestly, I never thought I’d need to post here, but here we go. This is what happened:

A few weeks ago, I was at a friend’s birthday party. It was at a local park, and people were scattered around, enjoying food, drinks, and games. I was having a good time, catching up with friends and playing cornhole. At some point, I noticed an acquaintance of mine, Sarah, sitting alone at a table looking a bit bored. She's not someone I know very well, but I thought it’d be nice to invite her to join our game.

So, I walked over and asked if she wanted to play with us. She seemed hesitant at first, but I insisted it would be fun. After a bit of back-and-forth, she finally agreed. However, I quickly realized she was not very good at the game and kept missing her throws. Instead of encouraging her, I found myself making sarcastic comments about her skills, joking with others about how she was contributing to our score by throwing the bags into the wrong lane.

At first, my friends laughed, but I could see Sarah’s expression change from amusement to discomfort. She eventually left the game, saying she needed to get something from her car. I felt bad, but my friends were still laughing, so I didn’t think much of it. Later, I overheard her talking to another friend, and I could hear her saying how she felt embarrassed about the whole thing.

When the party ended, I got a message from Sarah, expressing how my comments had made her feel unwelcome and belittled. I felt terrible and apologized, but she wasn’t the only one who was upset—my friends also thought I had gone too far and told me I should have been more supportive.

Now, I’m confused. I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings; I just thought we were all joking around. But I also realize that I didn’t act very kindly, and my friends were right to call me out.

Everyone sucks here,"Hey Reddit,

I’ve recently had a falling out with my best friend of over 10 years, and I’m feeling pretty torn about it. We’ve always been close, but we’ve been drifting apart lately due to some lifestyle choices we both made. 

I’ve been trying to focus on my health and well-being, so I’ve started a strict workout regimen and am eating healthier. My friend, on the other hand, has taken a different approach and has recently started going out more, drinking heavily, and living a bit recklessly. It's not that I don’t support her having fun, but her lifestyle choices have led to some concerning behavior, including skipping work and making poor decisions while intoxicated.

One night, she called me up to go out for drinks. I hesitated because I knew she would want me to drink heavily too, but I decided to go out just to be supportive. When I got there, she was already quite drunk and encouraged me to join her in drinking shots. I flat-out told her that I wasn’t comfortable with that since I was trying to stay sober and focus on my health. She got upset and accused me of being a ""buzzkill"" and not supporting her.

In the heat of the moment, I snapped and said that if she continued down this path, she was going to ruin her life and that maybe I needed to reconsider our friendship if she wasn’t going to take her life seriously. That hurt her deeply, and she ended up leaving the bar in tears.

I reached out to her afterward, trying to apologize for what I said, but she hasn’t responded to me since. I feel awful for what happened, but I also think I was justified in expressing my concern for her well-being. 

So, am I the asshole for being honest about my feelings regarding her lifestyle and saying that I couldn’t keep being friends if she continued down this path, or was she in the wrong for trying to pressure me into drinking?",263,1448,0.9,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_40557,2020-09-22 00:00:00,ESH,1851,AITA

That hurt her feelings, and she fired back, saying, “At least I don’t yell at my kid like you do!” I was taken aback and said something rude in return about her being overly dramatic and not understanding my situation. 

After that, the atmosphere got really tense. We ended up arguing about parenting styles in front of the kids, which felt awful. I stormed out with my son, and later, I realized that I should’ve handled my frustration better, and that maybe my sister was just trying to help.

When we moved into our current apartment, we decided to share the groceries and split the costs evenly. However, over time, I've noticed that L has been buying a lot of specialty items that are quite expensive, like organic snacks and fancy cheeses, while I tend to stick to more basic groceries. 

I understand that we all have different tastes and preferences, but it really started bothering me when I noticed that my regular groceries were getting overshadowed by her purchases. I would often find the fridge packed with her specialty items, while my simple food items were pushed aside or expired because they were forgotten.

After a few months of this, I started to feel frustrated. I would bring it up casually, suggesting that we could set a budget or maybe alternate the groceries we buy to keep it fair. But L always brushed me off, saying she works hard for her money and should be able to buy what she enjoys. 

One evening, I found myself particularly annoyed after discovering that she had bought an expensive gourmet item that I know she would only use a tiny bit of, while my essentials were running low. I snapped at her, saying that she needs to be more mindful of our grocery budget and stop treating our fridge like a personal specialty store. I could tell that my tone was harsher than I intended, and L got defensive, saying she deserves to enjoy her food and that I’m being controlling.

This turned into a bigger argument where we both started bringing up past grievances. I brought up how I felt neglected when she didn’t consider my grocery preferences, and she countered with how I never appreciated the effort she puts into buying quality items. 

After the fight, I felt bad for the way I spoke to her. I realized that I could have approached the issue with more understanding instead of letting my frustration boil over. On the other hand, L acknowledged that she could be more considerate of our shared budget but insisted that her happiness with food matters too.

Now we both feel hurt and misunderstood, and it’s clear that neither of us handled the situation particularly well. I’m feeling guilty for snapping at her, but I also think she could have been more open to my concerns.

I got frustrated and decided to call him out in the moment. I told him that it was exhausting always hearing about how he had the ""best"" experiences and that he could let others share too.

During our conversation, I asked him some casual questions about his feelings for my friend and how he saw their future. He seemed evasive, and I left our meeting feeling uneasy. I ended up texting my friend about what I discovered, sharing my concerns about his behavior. 

She was furious with me. She accused me of overstepping and being invasive, claiming that I was trying to sabotage her relationship. I genuinely thought I was helping, but I didn't realize how much she valued her privacy regarding her dating life.

I felt hurt because I was just looking out for her, but I also understood that I might have crossed a line. Now she’s considering distancing herself from me for a while. 

I guess I didn't mean to betray her trust, but I also think she could have been more open about her feelings. AITA?",205,1591,0.87,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_19234,2022-12-16 00:00:00,ESH,1598,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, I have a 17-year-old brother who has been getting really into this online gaming community. At first, it seemed harmless, but now it's consuming his life. He barely leaves his room, skips meals, and I’m pretty sure he's not even showering regularly. I’ve noticed he’s also been spending all his money on in-game purchases, and I'm worried he might be racking up debt on his credit card too.

I’m 22 and have my own life to manage, but I just can’t sit by and watch him throw his life away like this. My parents are indifferent; they think he'll ""grow out of it."" So, I've started taking matters into my own hands. I’ve been trying to make him get out of the house by planning family activities, but he just refuses to engage. 

I’ve even gone as far as unplugging his gaming console when he doesn’t respond to me after a few hours of gaming. I know this probably isn’t the best approach, but I really feel like I need to intervene. He gets super angry when I do this and has started calling me controlling and overbearing, which honestly makes me feel guilty.

Last week, I decided to take it a step further and I showed up at his room with a bag of his favorite snacks and tried to bribe him to take a walk with me. He was furious and yelled at me to leave him alone, saying I was ruining his life. I ended up yelling back, saying he was ruining his own life and that I was just trying to help.

Now my parents are upset with both of us and say we need to resolve it peacefully. I feel torn because I want to help him, but I also realize I might be pushing too hard. 

AITA for trying to intervene in my brother's life, or are we both just being unreasonable?",697,986,0.57,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_47013,2018-09-02 00:00:00,ESH,1664,AITA

I love spending time with both of them, and Lily is a sweet kid. However, recently I’ve noticed that Sarah has been really lax about setting boundaries with Lily, especially when it comes to her behavior in public.

A few weeks ago, we went to a coffee shop, and while we were chatting, Lily was running around, climbing on furniture, and yelling. I tried to be patient, but after a while, it got too chaotic, and I felt embarrassed. I gently suggested to Sarah that it might be a good idea to remind Lily about indoor voices and sitting down. Sarah brushed me off, saying that kids need to be kids, and not to worry about it.

Then, just last week, we went to a local park. While we were there, Lily started digging in the sandbox and throwing sand everywhere. Some kids nearby were starting to cry because they were getting sand in their eyes. I told Sarah that I felt it might be better to have Lily stop, but she got upset with me. She said I was being too strict and that children need to explore and express themselves. I pushed back a bit, saying that it’s one thing to explore and another to ruin other kids' fun, but she didn't agree.

Sarah texted me later, upset, saying, “You really overstepped. I don’t need you to parent my child. I want to create a free-spirited environment for her.” I felt bad, but I also think she needs to realize that there are limits to what’s acceptable in public spaces.

Now I’m wondering if I was wrong for speaking up or if she might just be a bit too permissive. AITA for wanting to help set some boundaries?",31,2331,0.85,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_11527,2022-07-03 00:00:00,ESH,1697,AITA

A few weeks ago, I went to a party that my coworker threw. I didn't know many people there, but it was a pretty chill vibe. I was just there to have a good time and enjoy some drinks. As the night went on, I ended up chatting with this girl who was also there alone. We hit it off pretty well, laughing and sharing stories. She seemed really into the conversation and I thought we had a connection.

After a while, she mentioned that her ex-boyfriend had just broken up with her and that she was trying to have a fun night to forget about it. I could tell she was a bit tipsy, and while I felt sorry for her, I thought I could help distract her and lift her spirits. So, I made a few flirty comments, thinking it was all in good fun. She responded positively and we kept flirting back and forth.

At some point, she leaned in close and kissed me. I was a little surprised, but I went along with it because, honestly, it felt good to have that connection. Just then, her friend came over and pulled her away, saying they needed to go talk. I felt kind of bad because I didn’t realize that her friend was looking out for her. 

Later, as the night winded down, I saw her again outside. She was a bit upset and told me that she regretted kissing me because she wasn't ready to move on from her ex. I awkwardly apologized and said I didn’t mean to complicate things. She then stormed off, leaving me feeling confused and slightly guilty.

A few days later, I found out through the office grapevine that her ex-boyfriend was really upset about the whole situation and that she had told him everything. Some of our coworkers have said I crossed a line by flirting with her when she was clearly vulnerable.

Now I’m feeling torn. I was just trying to have a good time, but I can see how my actions might have contributed to her emotional state.

Everyone sucks here,"My (f32) friends and I have a tradition of having themed parties, and this year we decided to throw a ""retro"" party where everyone had to dress up in outfits from the 80s or 90s. I was really excited about it and spent a lot of time putting together my outfit. I even found a cute vintage sweater and some high-waisted jeans that I thought would be perfect.

A week before the party, my friend Sarah (f30), who I know has a bit of a competitive streak, mentioned that she was planning to go all out with her outfit, including a big hair wig and neon accessories. I joked that I was going to steal her thunder with my outfit, and we laughed about it. But then, I noticed that she seemed a bit more stressed about the party than usual.

The day of the party, I showed up in my outfit, feeling great about it. But when I got there, Sarah had transformed into a total 80s icon. Her outfit was incredible, and it definitely stole the show. I felt a bit envious, but I tried to be supportive and complimented her.

Later in the night, after a few drinks, I made a snarky comment about how I thought my outfit was more authentic than hers, and I suggested that it looked more like a costume than something someone would actually wear in the 80s. I thought it was all in good fun, but Sarah got really upset and ended up leaving the party early.

Now, I feel bad because I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings, but I also think she might have been a bit over the top with her reaction. My other friends are split, with some saying I was just joking and others saying I should have been more considerate.

TL;DR - I made a joking comment about my friend's outfit at a themed party, which upset her, and now I feel guilty, but I also think she might have overreacted.",657,503,0.67,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_82235,2022-11-21 00:00:00,ESH,1753,AITA

He has a pretty demanding job, and I understand that he’s stressed. However, I feel like he’s been taking it out on me, being short-tempered and dismissive.

A few weeks ago, I decided to throw a surprise birthday party for him, thinking it would lift his spirits. I spent a lot of time and money planning it, inviting his friends, and decorating the place. When the big day came, he was surprised but not in a good way. He got really upset because he had been planning to spend a quiet day by himself to unwind, and he felt overwhelmed by all the people. He blew up at me in front of everyone, saying I never listen to what he wants and that I’ve ruined his birthday. I was mortified.

In the heat of the moment, I shouted back that he could have just communicated better instead of expecting me to read his mind. I ended up storming out, and the party quickly fizzled. After that, we both said some hurtful things to each other via text, and I think we both crossed lines we shouldn’t have.

Now, I feel awful that I didn’t consider his feelings more, and I should have asked him beforehand if he wanted a party.

I liked Mia well enough, but I noticed that she can be a bit controlling. A few weeks into their relationship, Jake confided in me that he felt like he couldn't spend time with his friends anymore without her getting upset. I tried to be supportive, but I also encouraged him to stand up for himself and not lose touch with his friends.

One night, Jake and I planned to hang out and watch the game, just like old times. I was really looking forward to it since I hadn’t seen him in a while. Just before he arrived, Mia texted to say that she wanted to join us. I replied that it was just a guys' night, but Jake asked if she could come anyway. I reluctantly agreed, wanting to keep the peace.

When Mia showed up, the atmosphere changed. She kept interrupting our conversation and making comments about how Jake should ""really be spending more time with her."" I got frustrated and made a sarcastic comment about how I was glad she was there to keep him in line. Mia didn’t take it well and snapped back at me, which led to an argument.

Jake ended up taking Mia’s side, saying that I shouldn't have made that comment and that I was being insensitive to her feelings. I felt hurt and called him out for letting her dictate his friendships. Things got heated, and we ended up having a blow-up argument right there. Mia left in tears, and Jake was furious with me.

When I told her about the trip, she seemed excited at first, but then she hit me with a bombshell. She said that since I was making more money now, I should cover all her expenses for the trip—flights, hotel, meals, everything. I was taken aback because I had only planned to split costs like we usually do. I told her I couldn't afford to pay for everything, and that it wasn’t fair to expect me to do that just because I got a raise.

She got really upset and said that if I didn't want to help her out, I was being selfish and that family should support each other. I got defensive and reminded her that I was also saving for my own future and that just because I have a better job doesn't mean I have to financially support her. 

Things escalated, and we ended up arguing. I feel like both of us are being unreasonable.

I’m a 29-year-old woman, and I need some advice. I’ve been living with my roommate (30M) for the past two years. We started as friends, and after our lease was up, we decided to live together because it made financial sense. 

Things were fine at first, but over time, I’ve noticed that he tends to be really messy and doesn’t contribute equally to cleaning. I work a demanding job, and I try to maintain the apartment, but every day when I come home, it looks like a disaster zone. Dishes pile up in the sink, trash isn’t taken out, and clothes are everywhere. I’ve tried talking to him about it several times, but he always brushes it off, saying he’ll do it later, which never happens.

Lately, I’ve become pretty frustrated with the situation. One day, after working a long shift, I snapped and yelled at him to clean up after himself. He got defensive and said that I was being too harsh and that I needed to lighten up. I felt bad for yelling but was also really fed up.

After our argument, I decided to stop doing his dishes and cleaning up after him altogether. I thought maybe if he saw how gross it was, he’d finally get the hint. However, this just led to more tension between us. He started leaving passive-aggressive notes around the apartment, and I responded by doing the same, which only escalated things.

Now we’re both living in a messy apartment, and the atmosphere is really uncomfortable. I know I could have handled the situation better, and maybe my approach of ignoring his mess was childish, but I also think he should have taken more responsibility as a roommate.

So, AITA for yelling at him and then refusing to clean his mess? Or is he being an asshole for not pulling his weight and then getting defensive when I spoke up? 

Edit: I should mention that he’s been under a lot of stress at work, so I do understand that might be affecting him, but I feel like that’s not an excuse for being messy and dismissive.",386,2080,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_96846,2022-05-30 00:00:00,ESH,1959,AITA

So, it all started when Sarah invited me to her birthday party. I was excited but had an important work deadline that I couldn’t ignore. I thought I could finish my work early, so I told her I would definitely be there and would arrive a bit late. Unfortunately, I ended up getting swamped with last-minute tasks and couldn’t make it to her party at all. I texted her to apologize, but she didn’t respond.

The next day, I saw on social media that she was posting about how hurt she was that I didn’t come. In a moment of anger, I commented on her post, saying that she was being dramatic and that I had a legitimate reason for missing it. I thought I was just being honest, but it blew up. Other mutual friends chimed in, taking her side, and I ended up feeling isolated.

Sarah confronted me about it later, and instead of just apologizing, I got defensive and brought up how she’s always had high expectations for her birthdays, which made her sound spoiled.

My sister has always been a bit of a dreamer; she has big ambitions but often fails to follow through. She dropped out of college after a year, claiming it wasn’t for her, and has bounced from one job to another without much success. Recently, she came up with the idea of starting her own online business, selling handmade crafts. I was supportive at first, but as time went on, it became clear she wasn’t putting in the effort needed to make it happen.

My sister is currently living with our parents, and they have been funding her lifestyle, which has created some tension in the family. I’ve tried to encourage her to get a stable job first before pursuing her business dreams, but she hasn’t taken my advice seriously. It’s like she has this fantasy of being a successful entrepreneur without doing the groundwork. I finally reached my breaking point when she asked me to lend her money to buy supplies for her crafts. I was frustrated because I felt like she was wasting money she didn’t have, and my parents were already supporting her enough.

In an emotional conversation, I told her that I wouldn’t give her any money until she got a job. I expressed my disappointment in her lack of ambition and work ethic. She got upset, saying I was being unsupportive and that she needed to chase her dreams. I argued back, telling her that dreams don’t pay the bills and that she needed to be realistic.

I tried to lighten the mood by sharing a funny and slightly embarrassing story about my childhood. But my partner's father interrupted me, saying, “Not everything needs to be a production. Some of us appreciate a little decorum.” I was taken aback, feeling insulted and embarrassed. My partner, visibly uncomfortable, attempted to smooth things over by changing the subject, but I could tell that tensions were rising.

In a moment of frustration, I snapped back, saying, “Maybe if your family learned to loosen up a bit, we could all enjoy ourselves instead of acting like we’re at a funeral.” It was a harsh comment, and I immediately regretted saying it. The room fell silent, and I could see my partner's face go pale. Their parents looked shocked and a bit hurt.

I ended up feeling frustrated and overwhelmed, so I snapped at my sister when she came back to the kitchen, saying she should have communicated better with me about how many people were coming and that I felt like a stranger in my own home. She got defensive and said I was being rude and ungrateful, and that I was ruining the spirit of Thanksgiving. 

Things escalated, and we both ended up saying hurtful things to each other in front of our family. It was awkward, and everyone was uncomfortable. The whole day felt ruined, and while I later apologized to her for my outburst, I still feel like she should have done a better job of coordinating instead of leaving everything to me.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I (26F) have a group of friends that I’ve known since college. We’ve been through a lot together, and I thought we were really close. Recently, one of my friends, Sarah (27F), has been going through a tough time. She lost her job a couple of months ago and has been struggling to make ends meet. We all sympathized with her situation and tried to support her emotionally.

However, things took a turn when it came to our plans for a weekend trip we had already booked months in advance. I had told everyone that I would be paying for the accommodation upfront, and we all agreed to split the costs once we got there. When the time came, Sarah asked if she could come along without paying her share, as she was still unemployed and didn't have any money. I told her that I understood her situation, but it wouldn't be fair for me and the others to cover her costs, especially since we had all budgeted for the trip in advance.

Sarah got really upset and accused me of not being a real friend. I felt bad, but I also knew that if I let her come for free, it might set a precedent for the future. I tried to explain my point of view, but she wouldn't listen. In the end, she decided not to come at all, and our friendship feels really strained now.

Now, I’m questioning whether I was being too harsh by standing my ground and not allowing Sarah to join us without contributing. Meanwhile, I’ve heard from another friend in the group that they think I should have just let her come because it’s just a temporary setback for her. On the other hand, I feel justified in wanting to keep the financial balance fair among friends.

So, AITA for not letting my friend come on the trip unless she paid her share? 

tl;dr My friend is struggling financially and wanted to come on a trip without paying, but I said no to keep things fair among our group. Now she’s hurt and our friendship is strained.",807,2252,0.79,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_61549,2024-02-27 00:00:00,ESH,1894,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"This happened last week and it’s been bothering me since. I was at a coffee shop with my friend, and it was pretty crowded. We found a small table by the window, which was nice because we wanted to chat and enjoy our drinks. As we were sitting there, I noticed a couple come in and look around for a place to sit. There were a few empty tables, but they were all designated for larger parties, and every other chair was taken.

Anyway, I saw them lingering around and making a fuss about not being able to find a spot. My friend suggested we offer to share our table since there was just the two of us. I thought that was a nice idea, so I called out to them and said, “Hey, you can join us if you want!”

They seemed a bit hesitant, but eventually sat down. However, as soon as they did, they started to complain about how small the table was and how it was cramped. At this point, I was getting a bit annoyed because we were trying to enjoy our time together, and their negative energy was a buzzkill.

So, I said something like, “Well, it’s not like we can magically make the table bigger. We’re just trying to enjoy our coffee here.” The couple looked shocked, and the guy muttered something about me being rude. I snapped back, “If you wanted more space, you should’ve just looked for a bigger table instead of hovering around.”

After that, it got really awkward, and they ended up leaving not long after. My friend said I was a bit harsh, but I felt justified because they were ruining the vibe for us.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I’m in college and I’ve been pretty close to my roommate, Sarah, for the past two years. We usually get along well, but we both have different study habits. I tend to study late at night, while she prefers early mornings. This semester, we both signed up for a challenging course that requires a lot of group projects and studying together.

Last week, we had a big project due, and we decided to split the work. I was responsible for the research and writing, while she was supposed to create the presentation. I started working on my part right away, but as the deadline approached, I realized I was getting overwhelmed with other classes and assignments. So, I procrastinated and ended up finishing my research just a day before it was due.

The night before the due date, I was up late working on my section, and Sarah came into the room around midnight. She was stressed because she had been working on the presentation all day but felt it wasn’t coming together. I was exhausted and snapped at her, saying it was too late to change things and she should’ve started sooner.

The next morning, we submitted the project, but I found out later that Sarah didn’t include some crucial information from my research in her presentation. When we got our grades back, we received a lower mark than we expected, and Sarah was furious. She blamed me for not giving her enough time to incorporate everything, while I felt she hadn’t communicated properly about what she needed.

Now, there’s this tension between us. I didn’t apologize immediately because I felt she should’ve managed her time better, but I also realize I could have been more supportive.

Recently, Mike started dating a girl named Sarah (30F), who is really great, but she also tends to be a bit dramatic and has a strong personality.

About a month ago, at a gathering, Sarah and I ended up having a pretty heated discussion about a political issue. It got a bit intense, and while I didn't mean to, I ended up saying something that offended her. She called me out on it, and I could tell she was genuinely upset. I apologized, but our dynamic felt a bit off after that.

Despite the awkwardness, I continued to hang out with Mike and Dave, and we started making plans for a weekend trip. I told them I wanted to invite Sarah to help smooth things over, but Mike was hesitant because he felt she might ruin the vibe with her drama. I insisted, thinking it would be a good chance for us to clear the air.

When we went on the trip, the tension between Sarah and me was palpable. I tried to be polite, but I could tell she was still holding a grudge. At one point, in front of the guys, she brought up our previous argument, trying to make a joke out of it. I snapped back, feeling defensive, and we ended up in a huge argument right there. Mike looked really uncomfortable, and Dave just kind of stayed quiet.

Afterward, Mike told me that I should have just let it go instead of escalating things. I felt bad for ruining the trip and for putting Mike in such an awkward position. But at the same time, I felt like Sarah was being overly sensitive, and I had a right to stand up for myself.

Everyone sucks here,"I’m a woman in my late 20s, and I work in a marketing team with a colleague named Mike, who recently started to take his role a bit too seriously. At first, I appreciated his enthusiasm, but it quickly became overwhelming. Mike has this habit of micromanaging every project we work on together. He has a tendency to give unsolicited advice, and it feels like he’s constantly double-checking my work, even though I’ve been in this field longer than he has.

Last week, we were collaborating on a presentation for a big client pitch. I was in the middle of finalizing my slides when Mike barged into my workspace and started pointing out what he thought were “errors” and “improvements.” He was nitpicking every point I made, insisting that I should change my entire approach to align with his vision. At first, I tried to stay calm and explain my choices, but he just wouldn’t listen.

Frustrated, I snapped at him in front of our coworkers. I said something like, “If you think you can do this better, why don’t you just take over? I’ve got my own style, and I don’t need your constant commentary!” The room fell silent, and I could see others exchange glances. Mike looked hurt and taken aback, but instead of backing down, he argued that he was just trying to help me improve my work.

After our argument, I felt bad for how I reacted, but I also believed he needed to understand that his approach was suffocating. Later, I overheard him talking to another coworker about how stressed he was feeling because he thought I didn’t like him. It made me feel guilty, but part of me also thinks he should be more aware of how he interacts with others.

Everyone sucks here,"For context, I am a high school teacher who has been working at the same school for a few years. I enjoy my job and try to create a supportive environment for my students. However, I sometimes get frustrated with the lack of discipline among some students, especially in my fifth-period class, which is notoriously rowdy.

A few weeks ago, we had a particularly chaotic class session. A couple of students were being disruptive, making jokes, and not taking the lesson seriously. I tried to maintain control, but the situation escalated, and I ended up raising my voice, telling them they needed to ""act like adults"" and that their behavior was unacceptable in a learning environment.

After class, one of the students, a girl who was not involved in the disruption, approached me and expressed that I had embarrassed the disruptive students in front of the whole class. She said that I should have handled it differently, perhaps by having a private conversation with them instead. I felt defensive and told her that sometimes you have to take a firmer approach to get through to students who don’t respect authority.

Later that day, I overheard the girl talking to a few of her friends about how I ""overreacted"" and ""made things worse."" I felt quite hurt by her comments and the way she was discussing me. In a moment of frustration, I sent an email to her parents, explaining my perspective and how I believe I handled the situation fairly, but that their daughter was spreading negativity about me to others. I wasn't accusatory, but I wanted them to know how I felt.

The parents responded by saying they felt I was unprofessional for involving them in a classroom management issue and that their daughter had a right to speak her mind. They requested a meeting with me and the principal, which made me feel even more defensive. 

In the meeting, it became clear that both sides were hurt and frustrated. I realized I could have approached the situation with the girl differently, perhaps recognizing her intention to stand up for her peers instead of dismissing her feedback outright. At the same time, I felt that my frustration with the chaotic classroom warranted my reaction, even if it wasn’t delivered in the best way.

Both the student and I left the meeting feeling misunderstood, and I acknowledged that I could improve my communication with students while they accepted that I had a difficult job.

We were at a party, and I noticed that she was acting a bit distant. I jokingly teased her about it, but I guess my timing was off because she snapped at me in front of everyone. It hurt, and I called her out for being overly sensitive, which escalated things. She ended up storming out of the party, and I thought it was just a minor spat we could get over. 

However, she didn't reach out to me afterward, and I was confused about why she was still upset. I chalked it up to her being dramatic and thought she would come around. Instead, she started hanging out more with another friend of ours, who I later learned was telling her to cut me off completely.

Fast forward a few weeks, and I decided to reach out to her. I was a bit annoyed that she hadn’t talked to me sooner, and I let her know that her behavior felt passive-aggressive. She fired back, saying I was dismissive of her feelings and that I needed to apologize for how I treated her at the party.

In a moment of frustration, I told her that if she wanted an apology, she could keep waiting because I didn’t think I did anything wrong. This just made things worse, and now she’s completely cut me out of her life. Both of us are hurt, and mutual friends say we’re both being stubborn and immature.

After a particularly frustrating week where I felt like I was constantly cleaning up after him, I decided to take a different approach.

In response, I lost my temper and told him that if he acted like a child by not cleaning up after himself, then he would be treated like one. My partner ended up getting involved to mediate, and we all ended up in a heated argument that didn’t resolve anything.

My brother and his fiancée are planning a large wedding, and they’ve asked me to be one of the groomsmen. I assumed it would be a fun experience, but as the planning progressed, I realized that they were making a lot of decisions that I felt were less than considerate to family and friends. For example, they decided to have the wedding on a holiday weekend, which I thought would make it difficult for many guests to attend.

I brought this up casually during a family dinner, hoping to give some constructive feedback. Instead of taking it well, my brother got defensive. He said that they wanted to do what was best for them and that I should just support them without criticizing their choices. I thought his reaction was a bit over the top, so I pushed back, saying he should be more considerate of others’ schedules.

I’m in a bit of a situation with my best friend, Jake, and I’m not sure if I’m in the wrong here. We’ve been friends for over a decade, and we have a pretty close-knit group of friends that we hang out with regularly. 

Recently, Jake started dating this girl, Sarah, and things moved pretty quickly between them. Within a few months, he was talking about moving in with her. I was happy for him at first, but as time went on, I started to notice some red flags. Sarah can be quite possessive and often criticizes Jake’s friends, including me. I brushed it off at first, thinking it was just typical relationship stuff.

One night, we were all out for drinks to celebrate Jake’s birthday. The mood was great, and everyone was having fun until Sarah showed up. She immediately started making snide comments about how Jake was spending too much time with his friends and how he should focus on her instead. It was awkward, and honestly, it felt like she was trying to create a divide.

After a few hours, I decided to bring it up with Jake privately. I told him that I was concerned about how Sarah treats him and how she seems to want to isolate him from us. Jake got defensive and said that I was just jealous of his relationship. I pushed back, telling him that I was looking out for him as a friend. The conversation escalated, and in the heat of the moment, I called Sarah a “toxic influence” on him. Jake got really upset and told me that I was being disrespectful to his girlfriend. 

The night ended with Jake leaving with Sarah, and since then, he hasn’t spoken to me. I’ve tried to reach out, but he’s been ignoring my messages. Our mutual friends are split on the situation; some think I was right to express my concerns, while others think I overstepped and should apologize.

Recently, it was her birthday, and despite our differences, I decided to reach out and wish her a happy birthday. I also commented on her post about having a great year ahead. Instead of a simple thank you, she replied with a snide comment about how maybe I should ""focus on getting my life together"" instead of worrying about her birthday.

She agreed, but when we got outside, it turned into a heated discussion about our respective exes, and we both ended up laughing and venting a bit too loudly.

Recently, Jake got a new girlfriend, Sarah (22), who I’ve also started to get to know. However, Sarah has a habit of being overly critical of Jake's friendships, especially mine. She often implies that I’m a bad influence and that Jake should spend less time with me.

One day, Jake invited a few friends, including me, to his birthday party. Sarah was there too, and she made a big deal about how I was ""taking Jake away from her"" during the party. At one point, she pulled Jake aside and told him that I shouldn't be allowed to monopolize his time. This made me uncomfortable, but I tried to brush it off and just enjoy the party.

Later on, I overheard Sarah talking to another friend about how I'm just using Jake for my own social needs and how I don't care about his relationship. I was hurt, especially since I’ve always been supportive of Jake. I decided to confront Sarah about it. I told her that I found her comments hurtful and that I value my friendship with Jake, but I don't want to come between them. She got defensive and accused me of trying to sabotage their relationship.

After our argument, I told Jake about what happened, hoping he would understand my side. He seemed torn but ended up siding with Sarah, saying I should have just let it go instead of escalating things. Now, I feel like I’ve lost a good friend because of this situation. 

AITA for confronting Sarah about her comments, or did I overreact and make things worse for myself and Jake?",358,643,0.56,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_58024,2021-04-28 00:00:00,ESH,1611,AITA

I have a small apartment and I work long hours, so sometimes I just need my own space to recharge. Not to mention, she has a pet parrot that squawks constantly, which makes it even harder to relax when I go over.

A few weeks ago, she invited me over for a movie night, but I was exhausted from work and really just wanted to chill at home. I mustered up the courage to tell her that I needed some “me time” and offered to reschedule for the following weekend. She seemed fine with it at first, but then later that evening, she started sending me passive-aggressive texts about how I was “too busy” for her and how she thought friends were supposed to support each other.

Instead of letting it go, I snapped back, saying that she needed to understand that not everyone operates on the same social schedule and that I wasn’t obligated to drop everything for her. This turned into a full-blown argument over text where we both said things we didn’t mean. I called her selfish for always wanting me to come to her place, and she accused me of being a bad friend for not making time for her.

In the end, we both ended up feeling hurt and frustrated, and now there’s this awkward tension between us.

Everyone sucks here,"I'd like to share my situation, and I genuinely want to know if I'm the asshole here. I'm a 29-year-old guy, and I have a younger sister, Sarah, who is 19. We've always had a close relationship, but lately, things have become complicated. 

Sarah recently started dating a guy who is 22 and has been living on his own for a couple of years. While I know he's not that much older than her, I can't shake the feeling that he's taking advantage of her naivety. She’s still in her first year of college and is exploring life, while he seems more established and experienced. 

I expressed my concerns to her. I told her that I didn't think it was a great idea for her to get involved with someone who has more life experience, especially since she's still figuring out her own path. I mentioned the differences in maturity levels and how she might end up getting hurt. I didn't scream or anything, but I was pretty firm about how I felt.

Sarah got really upset with me. She accused me of being controlling and not trusting her to make her own choices. I told her that I was just looking out for her and that I would feel the same way if she were dating an older guy. In my mind, it wasn't about the age difference as much as it was about the different life stages they were in.

In response to her dating this guy, I decided to take action. I made it clear that I wouldn't support her financially anymore. I used to help her out with her groceries and pay for her phone bill, but I told her that I would stop until she reconsidered the relationship. I thought it might help her see my point of view, but now I feel guilty. 

She feels hurt and betrayed, and I know I'm being harsh, but I genuinely believe that I’m trying to protect her from potential heartache. I also recognize that my approach might not have been the best. 

So, AITA for trying to control my sister's relationship and withdrawing financial support?",925,2777,0.94,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_41882,2021-09-14 00:00:00,ESH,1916,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I (26M) recently moved in with my girlfriend (25F) and we decided to share the grocery shopping duties. We both have our preferences, especially when it comes to food. I tend to lean toward healthier options and she loves her snacks and convenience foods. We agreed to each take turns shopping every week, but it quickly became a source of tension between us.

On my first grocery run, I spent a bit more than I normally would, aiming to stock up on healthier things that I thought we could both enjoy. I got fresh produce, some lean meats, and a few snacks I thought she might like. I also noticed that the pantry was filled with a lot of junk food that I didn’t want to buy again, so I didn’t include those items. 

When she saw the grocery haul, she was upset. She said I didn’t include any of her favorite snacks and that I was being controlling about the groceries. I felt frustrated because I thought I was doing something good for both of us—trying to make healthier choices. 

The following week, it was her turn to shop. I assumed she would be more balanced in her choices, but when she came back, the cart was filled with processed foods, frozen meals, and sugary snacks. I felt disappointed and slightly annoyed. I didn’t say anything initially, but it built up in me. 

When we sat down to have dinner that night, I couldn’t hold back anymore. I pointed out how her grocery choices were unhealthy, and I made some comments about how we need to be more mindful of what we’re eating. She snapped back, saying I was being condescending and that she should be able to enjoy what she wants without me judging her. 

We ended up having a heated argument, and I walked away feeling justified in my concerns about our diets. But I also realized that I could have been more understanding of her preferences rather than pushing my views on her.

The other day, she invited me over to help with some DIY decorations she wanted to do. I knew it would take a lot of time, and I had my own work to catch up on, but I went because I wanted to be supportive. However, when I got there, she had a specific vision that she wouldn’t budge on, and she kept rejecting my ideas. It started to feel less like a collaboration and more like I was just there to execute her plans.

After a few hours of this, I got frustrated and snapped at her, saying that if she wanted everything to be perfect, she should just do it herself instead of dragging me into it. She got upset and said I was being unsupportive and that I should be more excited about helping her out. I felt bad after the fact, but I also felt like she was being unreasonable and making me feel guilty for not being as invested in her vision.

Everyone sucks here,"My friend group consists of four of us: me, Sarah, Alex, and Jamie. We’ve been friends for years and have shared a lot of experiences together. Recently, we decided to go on a weekend trip to a cabin in the mountains, which we were all really excited about.

The night before the trip, I was feeling anxious about leaving my pets at home. I have two dogs and a cat, and I always worry about them when I’m away. I mentioned my anxiety in our group chat, saying I might need to cancel if I couldn’t find a pet sitter. Sarah responded by saying I should just take them with me, since the cabin was pet-friendly. I thought that was a great idea, so I ended up bringing my pets along.

However, when we arrived at the cabin, it turned out that Sarah is allergic to cats. She didn’t mention her allergy beforehand, and I felt terrible for not considering that my bringing my pets could affect her. She started sneezing and complaining about the cat hair almost immediately, which put a damper on the trip. In an attempt to remedy the situation, I agreed to keep the cat in a separate room to limit her exposure.

However, as the weekend went on, I started to feel stressed about my pets being isolated and wanted to spend more time with them. I let the cat out to mingle a bit, thinking it would be fine since I’d kept her away for most of the trip. Sarah ended up having a bad allergic reaction and had to take medicine to feel better, which made her even more upset with me.

We ended up having a big argument where I felt like Sarah was overreacting, and she felt like I was being inconsiderate. Alex and Jamie were stuck in the middle, trying to defuse the situation. In hindsight, I realized I should have been more considerate of Sarah’s allergy and maybe left the cat at home.

I’m a bit of a saver and like to keep a strict budget. I feel that we should be saving for our future, especially for things like a house or retirement. I often find myself tracking our expenses and reminding her about our budget limits. On the other hand, she’s more of a spender. She believes that life is too short to not enjoy it and feels like we should spend money on experiences and things that make us happy right now. 

The tension started when she wanted to book a weekend trip to a concert with her friends, which would put us over our budget for the month. I told her I didn’t think we could afford it, and we ended up arguing. I said she was being irresponsible with money, while she accused me of being overly controlling and not understanding her need for enjoyment.

Since then, I've caught myself checking our accounts more frequently and making comments about her spending habits, which she has found really frustrating. She sometimes retaliates by making impulsive purchases that she knows will annoy me, just to prove a point. It's become a cycle of us both being petty and not listening to each other.

Everyone sucks here,"A few weeks ago, I had a pretty big fallout with my close friend, Sarah. We had been friends for over five years, and I always considered her to be like a sister to me. However, we had a disagreement over something really trivial: she borrowed my favorite sweater without asking, and when I asked for it back, she had somehow ""misplaced"" it. I was obviously upset, not just about the sweater but the fact that she seemed to think it was okay to take something that meant a lot to me without permission.

In a moment of anger, I texted her a long message about how I felt disrespected and how I couldn't trust her anymore. Instead of responding to me directly, she posted a vague status on social media about ""fake friends"" and how people don’t appreciate what you do for them. It felt like a direct shot at me, and I responded by commenting on her post, calling her out for being petty and how she should just own up to losing my sweater instead of playing the victim.

Things escalated quickly. Our mutual friends started taking sides, and before I knew it, there was a whole group chat where everyone was airing out grievances and insults. I ended up saying some pretty hurtful things about her character, and she retaliated with some personal attacks of her own. 

Now, neither of us is talking to each other, and our friend group feels divided. I feel like I overreacted and shouldn’t have aired our issues publicly, but at the same time, I think she was being really inconsiderate.

Everyone sucks here,"TL;DR: My boyfriend and I got into a huge argument after I found out he didn't tell me he had a long-term girlfriend when we first started dating. I felt betrayed and accused him of being deceitful, while he claims he didn’t think it was important to mention since they weren’t together anymore.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year and a half now. When we first started seeing each other, we quickly hit it off and shared a lot about our pasts. I told him about my ex, and he mentioned that he had dated a girl for several years in college, but they broke up a year before we started dating. I appreciated his honesty, so I never thought twice about his past.

Recently, I met one of his friends who casually mentioned how my boyfriend had a serious relationship with this girl for around three years. This shocked me because he had downplayed it, and it made me feel like he didn’t trust me enough to share that part of his life in detail. I confronted him about it, and he brushed it off, saying it was all in the past and they hadn’t been together for a while. 

When I pressed him more, he admitted that they had actually been together until about six months before we started dating, but he felt it wasn’t relevant since they were already broken up. I felt hurt and betrayed because it seemed like he was hiding important information from me. I accused him of being dishonest and claimed that he should have been upfront about it, especially since I had shared my own relationship history.

He got defensive and said that he didn’t think mentioning an ex from a few years back, especially when they weren’t together anymore, was a big deal. He argued that he didn’t want to dwell on the past and thought it would only complicate things between us. I argued back that if the roles were reversed, he would probably feel the same way and would want to know.

Our argument escalated, and I ended up saying some hurtful things, suggesting that he might not be over his ex and that I was just a rebound. He lashed out at me for being overly sensitive and claimed I was making a mountain out of a molehill. 

We eventually calmed down, but it left a sour taste in both our mouths. I felt guilty about how I handled the situation, and he regretted not being more forthcoming.

To give some context, I've lived in my apartment for about two years, and my neighbor has lived next to me for about a year. We’ve had some minor disagreements over noise, but nothing too serious. However, things escalated recently when I decided to throw a small gathering for my birthday.

I sent out invitations a week ahead of time and made sure to keep the noise levels reasonable. The party was set to start at 6 PM and end by 10 PM. I thought this was fair since it was a Saturday night. I even texted my neighbor a couple of days prior to let them know about the party and assured them I’d keep it down.

The party went well, and everyone was having a good time. We were playing music and laughing, and I tried to keep the volume in check. At around 9 PM, my neighbor bangs on the wall, which startled me and my guests. I thought maybe they just wanted to remind us to keep it down, so I tried to lower the music.

Instead of just letting me know it was too loud, my neighbor actually came over to my door, looking furious. They started yelling at me about being inconsiderate and ruining their evening. I felt defensive and snapped back, saying they could have just knocked instead of banging on the wall. This led to a full-blown argument, with us shouting at each other in the hallway for a few minutes.

Eventually, I just closed the door on them, thinking I’d handled it poorly and they’d calm down.

I overheard them saying how they were going to report me to the building management for being a loud nuisance.

Feeling frustrated, I approached them to apologize and to explain that I genuinely thought the party was under control. But my neighbor refused to listen and kept insisting I was a terrible neighbor. I could feel myself getting angry again, and instead of just walking away, I told them they were overreacting and to get a grip.

In the end, the confrontation left a bad taste in my mouth. I realized I could have been more understanding, but I also felt my neighbor was being unreasonable. Now, we’re both on edge whenever we see each other, and I’m worried it will escalate further.

I (28F) have a close friend, Lisa (29F), who is a single mom to a 5-year-old boy, Max. I love spending time with them, but I often feel overwhelmed by the responsibility that comes with being around a young child. I don’t have kids of my own and sometimes struggle to relate to parenting challenges.

Last weekend, Lisa invited me over for a small get-together with some friends. She mentioned that she wanted to have a little wine and relax, and could I help watch Max for a bit while she caught up with everyone? I hesitated because I knew that Max could be quite a handful, but I figured it would be fine for a couple of hours. 

When I arrived, I was greeted with hugs from Lisa and Max, who was full of energy. Lisa had set up some toys and activities for him, and I thought it would be manageable. However, as the evening progressed, Max started getting restless. He wanted to play outside, but it was getting dark, and I didn’t feel comfortable letting him run around without supervision. I tried to distract him with some games inside, but he quickly lost interest and started throwing a tantrum.

I was at my wit's end and decided to take a break. I went to the kitchen to grab myself a snack, thinking that maybe some food would calm him down. I left Max in the living room with his toys. When I returned a few minutes later, I found him climbing on the furniture and jumping off the couch. I panicked and yelled at him to stop, which only made him cry harder and throw a toy across the room.

Lisa heard the commotion and rushed over to see what was happening. She was visibly upset. I tried to explain that I didn’t know how to handle his outburst and that I wasn’t comfortable with him being so reckless. Instead of helping me, she ended up yelling at Max, which made the situation worse. We both ended up arguing, with her saying I should be more patient and me saying that it wasn't my responsibility to manage her child’s behavior.

In the heat of the moment, I told her that I didn't sign up to babysit and that I came to enjoy some adult time, not to deal with a screaming child. That hurt her feelings, and she ended up sending Max to his room while we cooled off. The rest of the evening was pretty awkward, and I left feeling guilty and frustrated.

But I also felt like Alex was being overly critical and acting like the food police when I was just trying to be nice. I then confronted Alex in person, which turned into a heated argument. I said that if they were so concerned about allergies, they should stop eating anything from shared spaces themselves, as it could always be cross-contaminated.

I didn’t think it would cause any real trouble, just a laugh since we joke around a lot. I sent it to him with a message that said something like, ""Just a friendly reminder, buddy! 😂""

Mark didn’t find it funny at all. He called me and was really upset, saying that Sarah had seen the meme and interpreted it as me trying to sabotage their relationship. He told me that it made Sarah doubt his feelings for her even more, and he was really frustrated with me for being so inconsiderate.

I felt bad, but I also didn’t think I did anything that terrible; I just wanted to lighten the mood. I told Mark he was overreacting and that it was just a joke, but he said I should have known better given the situation. We ended up arguing, and now we’re both feeling hurt and angry.

In hindsight, I can see I might have been a bit inconsiderate, but I thought my intentions were harmless. So, am I the asshole here?",457,898,0.51,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_79688,2020-12-12 00:00:00,ESH,1629,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, I (22f) have a younger brother (16m) who has been struggling with his mental health for a while now. He’s been dealing with anxiety and depression, and it’s really taken a toll on him. I know he needs help, but he refuses to talk to anyone or get professional support. Instead, he just isolates himself in his room and plays video games for hours on end.

I’ve tried to be supportive by checking in on him and inviting him to do things, but he always shuts me down. It’s frustrating because I genuinely care about him and want him to be happy. Recently, I started getting angry about his lack of effort to improve. I snapped and told him that he’s wasting his life and that he needs to wake up and take responsibility for himself.

In my frustration, I also told him that if he doesn’t start making an effort, I won’t help him anymore. I started limiting my interactions with him, thinking it might push him to do something. I’ve also talked to our parents, but they’re too laid-back about it and think he’ll figure it out on his own. 

Now my brother is even more withdrawn, and I feel guilty for how I’ve handled things. My friends say I should have been more understanding, while some say tough love is necessary. I feel like I’ve contributed to the problem and made things worse.

Everyone sucks here,"I’m new to Reddit and not sure if this is the right place to share, but here it goes. So, I’ve been living with my partner for about a year now, and we’ve been generally happy. However, there’s one issue that has been bothering me. My partner has a younger sister, let’s call her Mia, who is 17 and still in high school. Mia has been struggling with some mental health issues and has recently been put on medication, which she’s been open about. 

A few months ago, my partner asked if we could let Mia stay with us for a few weeks during her spring break because their parents were away on a trip. I agreed, thinking it would be a nice way to support her. However, things took a turn. Mia has a habit of leaving her things everywhere and not cleaning up after herself. At first, I tried to be patient, but after a week of stepping over her clothes, dirty dishes, and her generally cluttering up our space, I started to get frustrated. 

One night, I snapped. I told my partner that I didn’t sign up to be a live-in maid for Mia and that it was disrespectful for her to treat our home this way. My partner got upset and said I was being too harsh on Mia, considering what she’s going through. I could tell my partner wanted to protect Mia, which I understood, but I felt like my feelings weren’t being acknowledged.

In retaliation, I started leaving passive-aggressive notes around the apartment about cleaning up after oneself. This only made things worse. Instead of addressing the issue directly, I let my frustrations fester and took it out in a way that made the atmosphere tense.

Eventually, Mia confronted me about the notes, and I ended up losing my temper and told her that if she couldn’t respect our space, she should go home. My partner was furious with both of us and said that I should have just talked to her instead of being passive-aggressive. Now, the situation is awkward and strained between us all.

I feel bad for how I handled things, but I also think my partner was too protective of Mia without acknowledging my feelings. So, AITA for losing my cool and being passive-aggressive, or is my partner being too sensitive about the situation?

Everyone sucks here,"So, I need to get this off my chest and see if I’m in the wrong here.

Last week, I went to a local café with a friend after work. We were just chatting and enjoying our drinks when I noticed a group of teenagers at a nearby table. They were loud and rowdy, but that wasn’t what bothered me. I overheard one of them making fun of another kid who wasn’t with them, calling him ""fat"" and ""ugly."" It really struck a nerve with me because I’ve struggled with my self-image for a long time, and I hate seeing people pick on others like that.

I know I should’ve just let it go, but I felt compelled to say something. I stood up and said, “Hey, it’s really not cool to make fun of people like that. You have no idea what they might be going through.” 

That seemed to catch them off guard, and they went quiet for a second. Then one of the girls in the group shot back, “Who asked you? Mind your own business!” 

At that point, I was already invested, so I responded, “I’m just saying, you’re not better than anyone else. Maybe try showing a little kindness instead of being jerks.” 

This only escalated things. The whole group started laughing and mocking me, saying things like “Who does this old guy think he is?” and “Get a life!” I felt embarrassed, but I didn’t back down. I just told them that their behavior was shameful and that they should be better.

Eventually, they all got up and left, still laughing as they walked out. My friend was kind of awkward about the whole situation and told me I shouldn’t have gotten involved. I felt a mix of satisfaction for standing up for someone, but also doubt about whether I overstepped. 

Was I the asshole for inserting myself into a situation that didn’t involve me, or was I right to call them out? ESH?",236,2129,0.56,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_75392,2021-06-10 00:00:00,ESH,1753,AITA

They let Lily run wild in public, screaming and throwing toys during family gatherings. I get that toddlers can be difficult, but there’s little to no discipline. I’ve seen her throw food on the floor at restaurants and not even flinch when her parents just laugh it off, saying she’s “just being a kid.”

The last straw for me happened during a family BBQ at my house. While we were trying to enjoy some food, Lily was climbing on the furniture, stealing food off other people's plates, and generally causing chaos. Instead of taking her aside to talk about her behavior, Jake and his wife just sat there, laughing and recording videos of her antics.

I finally snapped when she knocked over a tray of drinks, spilling soda all over my new rug. Instead of apologizing, Jake said, “Oh, she’s just being silly!” I lost my cool and told them that if they couldn’t control her, maybe they shouldn’t bring her around anymore.

Now, Jake is upset with me, saying I was too harsh, and I feel bad because I do love Lily. I just don’t think it’s fair to the rest of the family to let her misbehave without any consequences. My friend also thinks I overreacted, and now there’s tension between us.

I’m wondering if I went too far, but at the same time, I feel like they need to take responsibility for their child’s behavior.

Everyone sucks here,"I've been close friends with a couple, Jake (M32) and Emma (F30), for years. They have an open relationship, which I always thought was interesting but not really my thing. Recently, they invited me to a small gathering at their place, and it turned into a pretty wild night. 

We were drinking and joking around when Jake jokingly suggested that I should help him ""test"" the waters with a new girl he's been talking to. I thought it was just a joke at first, but he insisted that they were open to trying new things and that it would be fun. Emma seemed fine with it, and in a moment of bravado (and maybe too much tequila), I agreed to flirt with this girl, Sarah, who was also at the party.

Things escalated quickly, and before I knew it, I was making out with Sarah in the other room while Jake and Emma were cheering us on. It felt surreal and kind of exciting, but deep down, I felt uneasy. I pulled away after a few minutes, realizing that I didn't want to cross any lines or hurt my friends. But Jake kept encouraging me, saying it was all in good fun, and Emma was laughing and saying I should go for it. 

Long story short, I ended up sleeping with Sarah that night. The next day, I was filled with regret. I didn't want to hurt Jake or Emma, and I knew they had opened their relationship for a reason, but it felt wrong to have gone that far. I tried to talk to them about it, but they said they were fine with it, that it was just part of their dynamic, and that I shouldn't worry.

I usually bring a sandwich and chips, and she makes little remarks like, ""You know, that sandwich isn't really going to help you reach your fitness goals."" It feels condescending, and honestly, I just want to enjoy my lunch without feeling judged.

The other day, she organized a group workout after work and kept pestering me to join, even though I told her I'm just not that into working out. I finally snapped and told her that maybe not everyone wants to be a fitness fanatic like her and that it’s okay to enjoy food without feeling guilty. 

In response, she got defensive and started saying that I was just making excuses for being lazy. It turned into a heated argument, and a couple of our colleagues jumped in, agreeing that both of us were being too harsh on each other.

Recently, my friend Jake invited his new girlfriend, Sarah, to join us. This was the first time any of us met her, and I wanted to make a good impression.

As the night went on, I noticed that Sarah was really quiet and not engaging much with the group. I tried to include her in conversations, but she just seemed to be on her phone most of the time. At one point, while we were in the middle of a card game, I jokingly said, ""Hey Sarah, are you here for the game or just using us for free Wi-Fi?""

My parents have always been supportive, but lately, it feels like my brother has been leaning on them way too much. 

So, here’s the situation. Last week, my brother called my mom, upset because his wife was out of town for a few days for a work trip. He wanted my mom to come over and help with their toddler while he worked from home. I overheard the conversation and felt uncomfortable. I mean, my brother is an adult. He should be able to manage his own family, right? 

Later that week, I was in the kitchen when my brother came over to pick up some of my mom's homemade lasagna she had made for him and the baby. He walked in, and the first thing he said was, “Can you guys clean up after yourselves? The house is a mess.” I was taken aback. I mean, he’s not living there anymore; he doesn’t get to dictate how things are run at our family home.

In a moment of frustration, I snapped back, “Maybe if you spent more time cleaning up after your own mess instead of relying on Mom, you wouldn’t have to complain!” It escalated, and we ended up yelling at each other. My mom tried to mediate, but it just turned into a full-blown argument.

After my brother left, my mom told me I was being rude and that I should’ve just kept my mouth shut. She said that my brother was under a lot of stress, and he just needed some support. I felt bad for how I handled it, but I also think my brother needs to learn to stand on his own two feet.

So now I’m stuck wondering if I’m the asshole for defending my own space or if my brother is the one who’s being entitled and too reliant on our parents.

We began hanging out outside of work, going to lunch together, and even attending a few social events. Things were going great until I noticed that Sarah had a habit of making jokes at the expense of our colleagues, especially a quieter coworker named Mark.

At first, I laughed along, thinking it was all in good fun. But as time went on, I started to feel uncomfortable. Mark is shy and seems to take the teasing to heart. I decided to say something to Sarah during one of our lunch breaks. I gently told her that I didn’t think it was fair to poke fun at Mark and that he might not appreciate it as much as she thought. Sarah was taken aback and insisted that it was all in good fun and that Mark needed to lighten up. 

I didn’t want to ruin our friendship, but I felt strongly about standing up for Mark. So, I started to talk to him during breaks, trying to be friendly and supportive. I even mentioned to him that I thought he had a lot to offer and encouraged him to join us for lunch to get to know others better. Mark seemed appreciative, and I thought I was helping.

However, Sarah noticed my shift in attention and confronted me about it. She accused me of trying to “play the hero” and claimed I was trying to make her look bad for just having fun.

I might have raised my voice a bit, and I could tell I hurt his feelings. He got defensive and said I was being dismissive of his struggles. I told him that I didn’t want to hear his negativity and that he should try to be happy for me instead of bringing me down.

We agreed to split chores, but I’ve noticed that I end up cleaning most of the apartment while he just kind of lounges around.

I called him lazy and he called me controlling. It got awkward enough that some guests left early, and the whole vibe of the party was ruined.

I felt bad for her but also thought it was unfair to expect everyone else to cover her costs. I suggested that she could either find a way to pitch in more or maybe sit this trip out if it's too much financially. Alice got really upset and accused me of being insensitive to her struggles. I tried to explain that we all planned this as a group and that it would be best if everyone contributed equally, but she just kept saying I was being a bad friend.

I started to argue that it was overrated and not nearly as good as the classic spots we’ve all loved for years. I went on to say that just because a place gets a lot of hype doesn’t mean it’s actually the best, and I mentioned how the food critics might be swayed by trendy decor and social media buzz rather than the actual quality of the pizza.

Jake got pretty defensive and started to push back, and I could feel the tension rising in the group. I didn’t back down, though, and I made some sarcastic comments about how anyone could just claim a spot was the best after one visit, which I realize now came off as pretty condescending.

Eventually, one of our other friends, Sarah, chimed in to defend Jake, saying everyone is entitled to their opinion and I should respect others' tastes. I snapped back, saying that if people can’t handle a little constructive criticism, maybe they shouldn’t share their opinions in the first place.

The atmosphere became awkward, and some friends started to shift uncomfortably in their seats. Looking back, I can see that while Jake was being a bit stubborn, I was also being unnecessarily harsh and dismissive.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I was at a family gathering for my cousin's birthday. It was a pretty relaxed atmosphere, and everyone was just hanging out, eating, and reminiscing. My uncle, who can be a bit of a jokester, started talking about some embarrassing moments from our childhoods. It was all in good fun until he brought up a time when I accidentally spilled soda all over my aunt's new carpet.

At first, I laughed it off, but then my aunt chimed in about how she almost kicked me out of her house that day. I felt a little embarrassed, but I tried to keep the mood light. Then, without thinking much of it, I joked back, saying something like, “Well, at least I wasn’t the one who burned the turkey last Thanksgiving!” That was a reference to my aunt’s cooking mishap, and it seemed harmless, but my aunt suddenly got defensive and told me it was a low blow.

The atmosphere changed, and people got awkward. My uncle tried to lighten up the mood again, but I ended up feeling bad because I didn’t mean to hurt my aunt’s feelings. I thought we were all joking around, but I could see she was genuinely upset. After that, things got quieter, and we just moved on to cake without much conversation.

Later, my mom pulled me aside and said I should have kept my mouth shut because it wasn’t worth upsetting my aunt. I felt conflicted because I thought we were just teasing each other, but I also didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings.

Everyone sucks here,"**Edit**: I realize now that my reaction could have been handled better.

I (28F) have been in a long-term relationship with my boyfriend (30M) for about five years. Generally, we have a very supportive relationship, but lately, things have gotten a bit rocky due to some personal issues we’re both wrestling with.

A few months ago, I lost my job, which has put a lot of stress on me. The job search has been slow, and I find myself feeling inadequate and anxious about the future. Meanwhile, my boyfriend recently received a promotion at work, which has made him more confident but has also increased his workload. I’ve been trying to be supportive, but sometimes his success makes me feel worse about my own situation.

Last week, during dinner, I was venting about a tough day and he made a comment about how “some people just need to try harder to be successful.” I felt like he was indirectly criticizing me, so I snapped and accused him of being out of touch and unsympathetic to my struggles. I called him arrogant and said he wouldn’t understand because he’s never been in a tough spot like I am right now.

He got defensive and said I was just being bitter instead of taking responsibility for my situation. The argument escalated, and we ended up saying some hurtful things to each other, including me bringing up his tendency to prioritize work over our relationship. After a while, we both just sat in silence, feeling angry.

I later apologized for my harsh words, but he’s still upset and feels that I don’t support him either. Looking back, I realize we both could have approached the situation differently and communicated better.

Everyone sucks here,"I’ve always been passionate about my career. I work in marketing and have spent years climbing the corporate ladder. Recently, I was offered a promotion that comes with a significant raise, but it also requires relocating to a different city. My partner and I have been together for five years, and while we’ve talked about moving for jobs before, we've always agreed to stay in our current city for the sake of stability and our social circle.

When I got the promotion offer, I was ecstatic and immediately told my partner about it. To my surprise, he was not supportive at all. He expressed that he didn’t want to move and that he was happy with his job and life here. He said I was being selfish for wanting to uproot our lives just for my career advancement. I tried to explain how important this opportunity was for me, but the more I pressed, the more defensive he became. 

In a moment of frustration, I told him he was holding me back and that I had worked too hard to let this opportunity slip away. I suggested that perhaps we should reconsider our relationship if he wasn’t willing to support my career ambitions. This led to a huge argument, and he accused me of prioritizing work over our relationship.

After some time to cool off, I realized that I might have been too harsh in my approach and could have handled the conversation better. But he also could have been more understanding about my career aspirations. Now, we are both upset, and I feel like we’re at a crossroads in our relationship.

We’ve always had differing views on money; I’m more of a saver, while he tends to spend freely. This hasn’t caused too many issues until recently when he decided to take a spontaneous trip with some friends, which cost him nearly half of his savings.

When he told me about the trip, I expressed my concerns about his spending habits. I mentioned how we had talked about saving for a house together and how he was jeopardizing our plans. He became defensive and accused me of being controlling and unsupportive. I tried to explain my perspective, but it ended up escalating into a heated argument where I called him irresponsible.

After the trip, he came back in a worse mood and started to complain about being broke. I didn’t hold back and told him it was his own fault for choosing to go on a luxury trip instead of saving for our future. He shot back that I was just a miser and that I didn’t appreciate the value of experiences over material things.

We’ve both said things we regret, and I’ve been feeling guilty about how harsh I was in the heat of the moment. But at the same time, I feel he should’ve considered our plans before making such a big financial choice.

I thought it was funny in a playful way and joked, “Hey, everyone has their guilty pleasures!” But my friend took it to heart and turned to him, saying it was rude to judge someone based on their food choices.

Instead of backing her up, I laughed again, thinking it was just a light-hearted exchange. My friend was visibly upset, and instead of defusing the situation, I said, “Come on, it’s just a joke!” This made her even angrier, and she ended up dragging me away from the table. Outside, she told me I was an asshole for not standing up for her, and I said she was overreacting and that it was all in good fun.

Everyone sucks here,"Okay, so I need to get this off my chest.

I'm currently living with my older brother and his wife while I save up for my own place. I moved in a few months ago after losing my job and it was a temporary arrangement, but it’s starting to feel more permanent since I haven't found a new job yet.

My brother and his wife both work full-time, and they asked me if I could help out by doing some chores around the house. At first, I was okay with it; I figured it would help me earn my keep while I search for a job. I started doing things like cleaning, doing laundry, and cooking meals. However, it quickly became clear that they were expecting me to take on a lot more than just a few chores.

They both come home late and usually have dinner ready for them, and since they work hard, I get that they want to relax when they’re back. But they never really offered to give me any financial help or even expressed gratitude for what I was doing. Instead, they started treating me more like a live-in maid than a guest.

One night, after a long day of job hunting, I came home and saw a mountain of dirty dishes in the sink. I was already exhausted, so I snapped and said something like, “I’m not your housekeeper; you could at least help out sometimes!” My brother got defensive and said that I should have known that this was part of the deal when I moved in.

We ended up having a heated argument, and I said that I felt taken advantage of, while he accused me of being ungrateful for their hospitality. His wife chimed in, saying they were doing me a favor by letting me stay there rent-free, and I should be happy to help out. It escalated to the point where I felt like I couldn’t stay there anymore and almost left that night.

I ended up apologizing to them the next day, but I still feel frustrated. I think they overstepped by expecting so much from me without any acknowledgment of my situation. But I also realize my approach could have been better, as I did snap out of frustration.

I usually prepare dinner during the week, but since I also have a demanding job, I often find myself too tired to make anything elaborate. As a result, we mostly eat simple meals or takeout.

About a month ago, my partner mentioned that they were feeling frustrated with the lack of variety in our meals and wanted me to cook more often. I felt a bit hurt because I thought I was doing my best given our schedules. Instead of discussing it, I got defensive and pointed out that they could also help out with cooking or meal planning. We ended up in a heated argument where we both said some hurtful things. I accused them of being ungrateful for what I do, and they told me I was being lazy.

Since then, we've both tried to avoid the topic, but tensions are still high. I’ve noticed that my partner has started ordering takeout more often without discussing it with me first, which feels like a slight since we used to coordinate meals together. I feel resentful that they don’t contribute more to the cooking, and they feel unappreciated for my efforts.

Recently, we had another blow-up when I came home from work and saw that my partner had ordered a pizza without asking me.

Last weekend, we decided to have a game night at my place with a few friends. We were all having a great time, but after a few hours, I could see that some of my friends were starting to lose interest and looked tired. It was getting late, and I could tell they wanted to wind down.

I subtly tried to signal to Mike that it might be time to wrap things up. I made a comment about how late it was getting and that we should consider ending the night soon. He shrugged it off and kept going on about the game, completely missing my hints. 

As the night progressed, it became more and more apparent that my friends wanted to leave. I could see one of them yawning and another checking their watch. After a while, I finally decided I needed to be more direct, so I told Mike, “Hey, I think our friends are ready to call it a night. Can we finish this game quickly?” He got defensive and accused me of trying to ruin his fun.

Frustrated, I took it upon myself to end the game abruptly, which led to some groans from the group. Mike was really upset and started arguing with me about how I was being controlling. I felt guilty because I didn’t want to come off as a party pooper, but I also wanted to respect my friends’ time.

Afterwards, Mike stormed out of my place, saying I was an asshole for ruining his night. I reached out to him after he left, but he didn’t want to talk, saying he needed time to cool off.

Things got tense, and Lisa looked uncomfortable. Eventually, Tom excused himself, saying he didn’t want to be around people who were rude to him. Later, I overheard Lisa talking to another friend, saying that I was being unnecessarily harsh.

Lisa is an extremely strict parent, and to be honest, I think she goes overboard with her rules and punishments. She's always been a perfectionist and expects her kids to act like little robots. She believes that discipline is the most important aspect of parenting and that kids should never be allowed to express their emotions freely.

When Lisa found out, she was furious. She accused me of undermining her parenting and said I was setting a bad example by allowing them to break her rules. She went on about how kids need structure and discipline, and I shouldn't confuse them with fun. I was taken aback because I genuinely thought I was giving them a break from her intense upbringing.

I thought it’d be funny, but he didn’t see it that way. He got really upset and called me immature for trying to manipulate him into spending time with me. I felt bad, but at the same time, I was frustrated that he couldn’t see where I was coming from.

In the heat of the moment, I told him that he was being a bad friend for not even trying to balance both relationships. We both ended up saying things we didn’t mean, and the argument escalated to the point where we said we needed some space. Now I'm feeling guilty about how it all went down, but I still think he could have made more of an effort to maintain our friendship.

Everyone sucks here,"I’m 28 and recently moved to a new city for work. I’m an introvert and have always found it hard to make friends, so I was excited when I joined a local book club. The members seemed nice, and I thought this would be a great opportunity to connect with people.

After a couple of meetings, I noticed that one member, Lisa, a very outgoing and talkative person, often dominated the conversations. While I appreciate her enthusiasm for books, it made it difficult for others, including me, to share our thoughts. I tried to speak up a few times, but I would get interrupted or the topic would shift back to Lisa.

Frustrated, I decided to play a prank. During our next meeting, I brought along a small voice recorder. I set it up to record the discussion, thinking I could use it to show Lisa how often she interrupted others. My plan was to share the recording with the group afterward as a way to highlight the conversation dynamics.

However, during the meeting, I got so caught up in my own plans that I ended up not paying attention to the discussion at all. When I finally played back the recording to show everyone, it became clear that I had also been interrupting and talking over others, just as much as Lisa had been. It turned into a big argument, with some members feeling uncomfortable and others taking sides. 

In the end, I apologized to the group for my behavior, but I also confronted Lisa about her interruptions. While I felt justified in wanting to point out the issue, I realize now that my approach was poor. The group is now divided, and some members are considering leaving because of the tension. 

So, AITA for trying to expose Lisa’s behavior but ending up causing chaos in the group?",503,1278,0.81,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_37786,2018-05-28 00:00:00,ESH,1711,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"BACKGROUND: I’m a 22-year-old college student living in an off-campus apartment with three other roommates. We're all friends from high school, and we decided to live together to save money on rent. Recently, I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed with schoolwork and part-time job responsibilities, which has made me more irritable than usual. 

One night, after a long day of classes and work, I came home to find that my roommates were throwing a small party. They had invited a few friends over without telling me and had made a mess of the living room. I was exhausted and just wanted some quiet time. I asked them to keep the noise down, but they were clearly having fun and didn’t take my request seriously.

Feeling frustrated, I decided to vent a bit. Instead of talking calmly, I snapped at them, saying something like, “You guys are so inconsiderate! Can’t you keep it down for just one night?” This escalated into a shouting match where I accused them of being selfish and not caring about my feelings. They defended themselves, saying they were just trying to unwind and that I should lighten up. 

In my anger, I ended up knocking over a drink that one of my roommates had on the table, spilling it everywhere. This led to more shouting, and one roommate retaliated by throwing a piece of pizza at me, which I dodged. In the moment, I yelled back and threw a pillow at him, and chaos ensued with us all yelling and throwing random soft objects at each other like we were kids again. 

Eventually, we all calmed down, but it turned into an awkward silence filled with tension. I apologized for losing my cool, but they also admitted they should have given me a heads-up about the party. We all knew we should have handled things better, but the damage to our atmosphere was done.

I’ve noticed his grades slipping, and he’s become less engaged in family activities.

One evening, I asked him to put down the controller and join the family for dinner. He rolled his eyes and said he was in the middle of a game.

He snapped back that I didn’t understand his passion and that he was just trying to have fun. 

Things escalated and I ended up yelling that he was being lazy and that I was tired of his attitude. My daughter, who was just trying to eat her dinner, got upset and started crying, saying we were ruining family time. I realized that I may have overreacted and that my frustration with our son’s behavior could have been handled better.

At some point during the evening, the conversation turned to politics, and things got a bit heated. One of my friends, who is usually very opinionated, started pushing his views, which were quite controversial. I found myself getting increasingly frustrated because I felt he was being disrespectful to those who disagreed with him.

Instead of debating him calmly, I snapped and made some sarcastic comments, which escalated the tension in the room.

My friend reacted defensively, and we ended up going back and forth with insults, both of us raising our voices.

Everyone sucks here,"There’s a lot to unpack here.

I (30F) have a younger brother, Jake (22M), who has always been a bit of a free spirit. He dropped out of college a couple of years ago and has been trying to find his way ever since. Lately, he’s become really into conspiracy theories and has started distancing himself from our family, which is concerning.

A few months ago, he started dating a girl, and I was hopeful that she could help him get back on a more positive path. However, I soon discovered that she shares his extreme beliefs, and they seem to be feeding off each other’s toxic ideas. Jake has become increasingly aggressive in his views, and it’s really hard to talk to him without it turning into a heated debate about his latest conspiracy theory.

Last week, we had a family dinner, and things escalated when he started ranting about how society is against him and how everyone is brainwashed. I tried to reason with him, but it only made him angrier. At one point, I snapped and told him he was being ridiculous and that he needs to grow up and take responsibility for his life. He shouted that I was just another sheep, and in a moment of frustration, I called him a loser.

After that, he stormed out, and I felt awful. I know I shouldn’t have called him names, but I was just so frustrated with him. My parents are upset with both of us, and now the family dynamic is really tense. I regret how I handled things and I’m not sure if I should have just kept quiet instead of engaging in a fight.

Was I wrong for yelling at him? AITA?",171,1954,0.61,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_24994,2023-06-05 00:00:00,ESH,1538,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I'm (29M) currently in the middle of a pretty contentious situation with my sister, Sarah (32F), and her husband, Mike (33M). We're a close family, but things have gotten tense lately, and I’m not sure if I’m in the wrong or if we’re all just being unreasonable.

A few weeks ago, Sarah announced she was pregnant with her first child. Naturally, we were all excited for her, but ever since the announcement, she’s been pretty intense about everything pregnancy-related. She's constantly sending family group texts about her cravings, her research on parenting, and all the stuff she plans to do for the baby. While I appreciate her enthusiasm, it’s been a bit much, especially since I’m not a parent myself and don’t really know what to say.

Last weekend, during a family barbecue, Sarah was talking about her plans for a natural birth and how she’s going to avoid any medications. I made a light-hearted comment about how it’s great she’s so dedicated, but I joked that it’s okay to have an epidural if things get too tough. I thought it was funny, but she didn’t take it that way. She went off about how people need to stop pushing the idea of pain relief on mothers and how childbirth is a natural process. I tried to explain I was just trying to be supportive, but she was really upset and accused me of not respecting her choices.

At that point, Mike jumped in and sided with Sarah, saying I should be more sensitive about her feelings during this time. He said it was clear I just don’t get what she’s going through. I felt attacked and said that I didn’t mean any harm, but maybe they were overreacting a bit. I know I can be sarcastic sometimes, so perhaps I went too far with my joke.

Afterwards, Sarah texted me saying she needed some space and that I should think about how my words affect others, especially when it comes to pregnancy. I feel bad that she’s upset, but I also think it’s unfair that they’re both coming down on me for what I thought was just a harmless joke. I’ve been second-guessing everything and wondering if I crossed a line. 

So, AITA for making a joke about childbirth that my sister found offensive? 

TL;DR: I made a light-hearted joke about my sister’s pregnancy choices, which upset her and her husband. Now they’re both mad at me, and I’m questioning if I was wrong for trying to be funny.",83,2578,0.75,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_20614,2024-01-28 00:00:00,ESH,2334,AITA

Last month, we had plans to go to a concert that we had been looking forward to for months. The day before the concert, Jake texted me saying that he couldn’t go because his girlfriend had planned a surprise dinner for them instead. I was really disappointed, but I didn’t want to be a jerk, so I said it was fine and that I hoped they had fun.

When the day of the concert came, I decided to still go alone since I had already bought the ticket. I ended up having a decent time, but I couldn't help but feel a bit resentful. Later that night on social media, I saw that Jake had posted pictures of him and his girlfriend at a fancy restaurant that looked a lot more extravagant than I had expected.

I’ve known Mark for a long time, and while I thought he was a decent guy, I had some serious concerns about his financial habits. He had a history of racking up credit card debt and made some questionable investments that had gone south. I voiced my worries to Lisa, but she was totally in love and brushed me off.

As the wedding date approached, I became increasingly frustrated. Lisa had just quit her job to pursue her passion for art, and I feared she was heading for a financial disaster by marrying someone who wasn’t responsible with money. I felt like it was my duty as her sister to protect her from what I saw as a reckless decision.

After another argument where I tried to convince her to at least postpone the wedding until she had a steady income, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I contacted a few of our family members and shared my concerns about Mark’s financial history, hoping they would help me talk some sense into her. I even gathered some evidence, including screenshots of his social media posts where he bragged about his “get rich quick” schemes.

The fallout was messy. Lisa called off the wedding and blamed me, saying that my actions had put too much pressure on her and Mark. However, she also admitted that she had some doubts about him that she was brushing aside. Now, the whole situation has left a rift between us, and I feel awful about it.

One day, Tom and I happened to be at the same party. We ended up chatting quite a bit and discovered that we both love playing the same video games. We started playing together online, and it became a regular thing. I thought it was great that we could bond over something we both enjoyed.

However, Rachel started to get a little distant. At first, I chalked it up to her being busy with Tom, but then I noticed she was acting a bit passive-aggressive whenever I mentioned Tom or our gaming sessions. I tried to reassure her that I wasn’t trying to steal him away, but she brushed it off.

Things escalated when Tom gave me a limited edition game console as a gift for my birthday. He said he knew I’d appreciate it and that he had an extra one. I was thrilled but didn’t think much of it. I posted a picture with it on social media, tagging him to thank him. 

The next day, Rachel blew up at me in our group chat, accusing me of trying to undermine their relationship and saying that I was taking advantage of her boyfriend. I was shocked and confused. I tried to explain that it was just a gift between friends and that I had no intention of causing any problems, but she refused to listen.

Growing up, it was all about who could get the better grades, who was more athletic, and who could impress our parents more. Fast forward to now, and he’s recently gotten engaged, and I couldn’t be happier for him. He’s found someone who really complements him.

Just last week, we went out for brunch, and Leo started crying because he wanted pancakes instead of the eggs Jenna ordered for him. It escalated quickly, and Jenna had to leave the restaurant in a hurry, leaving the food untouched.

I mentioned casually that I think it might be time for her to look into some parenting classes or strategies because I felt overwhelmed by Leo’s behavior, especially when we’re out. I thought it was coming from a place of love since I want her to have a great experience as a parent, but it didn’t go over well. Jenna got really defensive and said I had no idea what it was like to raise a child and that it was easy for me to judge from the outside. 

I also kind of snapped and told her that it wasn’t fair for me to be the one who had to deal with the consequences of Leo’s behavior, especially when we were supposed to be enjoying time together. I regret saying that because I know being a parent is tough, but I also felt overwhelmed.

After that conversation, I decided to take a step back. I didn’t want to be a part of the wedding if I wasn’t seen as important enough to be acknowledged in that way.

Instead of thanking me for saving her food, she snapped at me for not waiting. I tried to defuse the situation by joking that she should've planned better, but it only made things worse. Sarah started to sulk, which put a damper on the mood for everyone.

By the end of the night, Sarah left early, and the atmosphere was tense. I feel bad because I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings, but I also think she overreacted. I’ve been thinking about it, and maybe I should have been more understanding of her situation while also standing my ground.

Everyone sucks here,"My sister has always been the favorite child in our family, and it's been a source of tension between us for years. She’s the golden girl — perfect grades, great job, and constantly praised by our parents. I, on the other hand, have struggled with my career and personal life. It’s hard not to feel overshadowed by her.

Recently, my sister got engaged, and my parents threw her a huge engagement party. They went all out, inviting family and friends, and the whole event was a lavish affair. I helped with some of the planning, trying to support her, even though I felt a twinge of jealousy. 

At the party, I tried to put my feelings aside and enjoy the moment, but it just felt like everything was centered around her. During the speeches, my parents praised her accomplishments and future plans, and I felt invisible. 

When it was my turn to say something, I awkwardly congratulated her but ended up expressing my frustration about always being in her shadow. I said something like, ""It's great to see you get everything you want, but I wish I could have a little of that attention too."" The room fell silent, and my sister looked hurt. My parents were furious and took me aside after, telling me that I ruined the night and embarrassed my sister.

Now, I feel bad for what I said, but I also think my feelings about being overlooked were valid. My sister hasn’t spoken to me since, and I’ve been avoiding my parents because I know they’re upset with me too.

Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I have a 6-year-old son who is really into soccer. He plays on a local team and loves it. My partner is very enthusiastic about our son’s soccer journey and often talks about how they can work together to improve his skills. I support our son’s interests, but I also believe in balance, and I want him to enjoy a variety of activities, not just soccer.

Recently, my partner decided to sign our son up for a weekend soccer camp without discussing it with me first. When I found out, I expressed my concerns about it being too much soccer for someone his age and suggested we should involve him in other activities too, like swimming or art classes. My partner got defensive and argued that soccer was his passion and that I was trying to restrict him.

In the heat of the moment, I raised my voice, saying that just because my partner loved soccer doesn’t mean our son has to be consumed by it. My partner shot back, saying I was being unsupportive and not understanding how important this was for their relationship. The argument escalated, and we ended up saying some hurtful things to each other about our parenting styles.

In the end, I agreed to let our son attend the camp but still insisted we should explore other interests as well. Now there’s a lingering tension between us. I feel like I might have overreacted by raising my voice, but I also think my partner shouldn’t have signed our son up without considering my input. 

So, AITA for being upset about the soccer camp and voicing my concerns, or is my partner the one in the wrong for acting without discussing it with me?",427,1040,0.84,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_22346,2020-05-29 00:00:00,ESH,1603,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Title: AITA for confronting my friend about their parenting choices?

I (29F) have a close friend, Sarah (30F), who has two kids, ages 6 and 4. Recently, I've noticed some concerning behaviors in how Sarah handles discipline and parenting. She often resorts to threats and yelling, especially if the kids are misbehaving or not listening to her. I could understand if it was a one-time thing, but it seems to be a pattern, and I can see the kids getting scared and anxious around her.

One day, while we were having coffee, I casually brought it up, stating that I had noticed she seemed really stressed and that I was worried about her and the kids. I suggested that maybe she could try some positive reinforcement methods instead of yelling, mentioning how I've read that it could really help foster a better relationship with the kids. I thought I was being supportive, but Sarah got defensive, saying that I don't understand what it's like to be a parent and that every parent has their own style of discipline.

Feeling frustrated, I pointed out that there is a difference between discipline and intimidation and that I was genuinely concerned for her kids’ well-being. This led to a heated argument, and we both ended up saying things we regretted. I told her that if she kept this up, I would have to rethink how involved I want to be around her family. She accused me of being judgmental and claimed that I was trying to undermine her parenting.

Afterwards, I felt bad for how things escalated but also believed I was coming from a place of care. I still think her approach is harmful, but I could have approached it differently. Now, I’m wondering if I was out of line for speaking up, or if my concern was valid.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I recently had a bit of a falling out with my friend, Jamie. We’ve been close for years, but things have been rough between us lately because of some personal issues he’s dealing with. He’s been going through a tough time with his mental health, and while I want to support him, I also feel overwhelmed because he often leans on me for everything.

A few weeks ago, I was out with another friend, Sarah, and I ended up venting about Jamie's behavior. I told her how difficult it’s been to help him while also dealing with my own life, and I mentioned a few specific instances where his actions hurt me. I didn’t mean to paint him as a villain; I just needed to express my frustration to someone who wouldn’t judge me.

Fast forward a few days, and Jamie reaches out to me, clearly hurt. He tells me that Sarah mentioned my comments to him, and he feels betrayed. I was shocked! I didn’t think Sarah would share anything I said in confidence. When I confronted Sarah about it, she defended herself, saying she thought Jamie needed to know how his behavior was affecting others.

In the heat of the moment, I reacted poorly. I lashed out at both Jamie and Sarah, calling Jamie overly sensitive and saying he should toughen up. To Sarah, I said she was being a busybody for sticking her nose where it didn’t belong. I didn’t handle the situation with the care it deserved, and now I feel like I’ve lost both a friend and a confidant.

Now, I’m left feeling guilty for venting about Jamie and upset at how everything unraveled. I recognize my part in this drama, but I also think Sarah shouldn’t have shared my private frustrations with Jamie.

Everyone sucks here,"I'm a 28-year-old guy who has a close group of friends that I’ve known since high school. We’ve always had a fun dynamic, but recently things have taken a turn. One of my friends, Jake, has been dating a girl named Mia for about six months. We’ve all gotten to know her, and I thought she was pretty nice and easy to get along with. However, recently, I've noticed that she tends to dominate conversations and often makes fun of my interests, which has started to annoy me.

One night, we were all hanging out at my place for game night, and the conversation shifted towards our favorite childhood shows. I was excited to share my love for a particular cartoon that meant a lot to me. As soon as I started talking about it, Mia interrupted me and said, “Wow, that's such a lame choice. Why would anyone like that?” I tried to brush it off, but it genuinely hurt my feelings. After that, I made a sarcastic comment about her favorite show, which I thought was equally ridiculous.

Things escalated, and we ended up in a back-and-forth where I told her she shouldn’t put others down just because she thinks she's cooler than everyone else. My friends were caught in the middle, and while some agreed with me, others thought I was overreacting. The atmosphere became really tense, and eventually, Mia left in tears, which made me feel terrible.

The next day, Jake texted me, saying that I really hurt Mia’s feelings and that I should apologize. I thought about it and felt that while I was rude, she also didn’t have to tear down my interests. So, I told him that I felt both of us were at fault and that an apology wasn’t necessary from my side. I reached out to Mia to clear the air, but it turned out she wasn’t ready to talk to me yet.

As I was waiting, a mom came in with her toddler who was running around a bit. The kid was cute, but he kept darting around the line, bumping into people and even knocking over a chair. The mom wasn't doing much to control him; she was too busy scrolling on her phone to notice.

After a few minutes, the toddler started playing with a bag of coffee beans that was meant for sale. I tried to be patient, but when the kid accidentally knocked over the bag, spilling beans everywhere, I couldn’t hold back. I said, “Hey, can you please watch your kid? It’s not a playground!” 

The mom finally looked up, a bit startled, and she snapped back, “Excuse me? He’s just having fun!” She didn’t seem to care that her kid had caused a mess and was disrupting everyone around.

At that point, I was frustrated. I replied, “Fun shouldn’t come at the expense of everyone else. Maybe you should be a bit more aware?” 

That definitely escalated things. Other customers started looking over, and a few even chimed in, saying I was being rude. The mom told me to mind my own business, and I could feel the tension rising. 

After that, I felt bad for speaking out, but I also felt that I had a point about being considerate in public spaces. As I left, the barista thanked me for trying to keep the peace, but I could see the mom was still glaring at me.

Lately, he's been really messy around the apartment. He leaves dirty dishes in the sink for days, clothes strewn everywhere, and crumbs all over the common areas. I've tried to talk to him about it gently, explaining that it bothers me and makes it hard for me to relax at home. He just brushes it off and says he’s too busy to clean and that I’m overreacting.

Last week, after coming home from a long day, I found the kitchen in complete disarray. I reached a breaking point and decided to clean it myself. However, in a fit of frustration, I threw out some of his old takeout containers that he had let pile up on the counter instead of taking them out. When he got home and saw what I had done, he was furious. He called me a control freak and said I had no right to throw away his stuff, even if it was trash. 

We ended up having a huge argument. I told him he needed to be more responsible and that I shouldn’t have to live in a pigsty. He claimed that I was being inconsiderate of his struggles and should just let some things slide. 

I feel bad for throwing out his stuff, but I also feel like I’ve reached my limit. It’s been stressful living in a messy environment, and I thought this might motivate him to change his habits. Now, neither of us is speaking to each other, and it’s really awkward.

However, we have some differences in our lifestyles and how we approach social situations. I tend to be more extroverted and enjoy hosting gatherings, while my partner is more introverted and prefers quieter evenings at home.

Recently, I decided to throw a small gathering for some friends to celebrate a promotion at work. I was excited and thought it would be a great way to unwind and enjoy some quality time with my friends. I sent out invites and planned everything, but I didn’t discuss it with my partner beforehand. I assumed they would be okay with it since we had hosted gatherings in the past.

When the day of the party arrived, my partner seemed visibly upset. They expressed that they weren't comfortable with having people over, especially since they had a long week and just wanted to relax. I brushed it off at first, thinking they would warm up to it once our friends arrived. 

As the guests started to arrive, I noticed my partner becoming more and more withdrawn. They eventually retreated to our bedroom and closed the door, which made me feel embarrassed in front of my friends. I tried to check on them a couple of times, but they didn't want to come out, saying they felt overwhelmed. 

After the party, we had a huge argument about it. I felt like I was justified in wanting to celebrate and have friends over, while my partner felt I was inconsiderate for not respecting their need for space. We both said things we regretted, and it ended with us both feeling hurt and frustrated.

Earlier this week, my best friend and I went to a coffee shop we frequented to catch up. We both love trying new drinks and sharing them with each other. While we were there, I noticed that the barista, who is usually really friendly, seemed a bit off. She was short with customers and not her usual chatty self. 

When our drinks came out, I got a matcha latte and my friend got a vanilla cold brew. We sat at our table, and I decided to take a picture of our drinks for Instagram, which I do often. I snapped a few photos, and while I was setting up for a good shot, I accidentally caught the barista in the background looking over at us. I didn’t think much of it, but she immediately scowled and rolled her eyes.

A minute or two later, she came over to our table and said, “You know, not everyone wants to be in your little social media world.” I was taken aback. I wasn’t trying to include her in the picture or anything, and I thought she was overreacting. I told her, “I’m just taking pictures of my drinks, it’s not that serious.” 

My friend, trying to diffuse the tension, suggested we go outside to take our pictures. But I was still annoyed and said something like, “Well, maybe if you didn’t look so miserable, people wouldn’t mind being in your pictures.” 

The barista’s face fell, and she walked away without saying anything. My friend and I left shortly after, but I felt guilty about how I responded. I usually try to be nice to service workers, but her comment really rubbed me the wrong way.

I was looking forward to spending time together, especially since Jake and Sarah recently had a baby, and I wanted to help out with them during the trip.

A few days before the trip, I found out that the cabin didn't have a proper crib or playpen for the baby. I reached out to the rental company to see if they could provide some kind of portable crib, but they couldn't do it. I was worried about the baby's safety and comfort, so I decided to cancel the booking. I thought it was for the best because I didn't want to be responsible if something happened to the baby.

I called Jake to let him know what I had done. He was furious. He said I overstepped my bounds and that it wasn't my decision to make. I explained my concerns about the cabin not being suitable for a baby, but he insisted that they could manage and that I should have discussed it with them first instead of making a unilateral decision. Jake said that now they were out of a vacation and that I had ruined their plans.

I felt terrible, but I also thought I was doing the right thing for the baby. We ended up having a heated argument over the phone, and I hung up feeling hurt and confused.

I called him out in front of everyone, saying something like, “Wow, it’s nice to see you’ve forgotten all about your friends now that you have a girlfriend.” The comment came out harsher than I intended, and I could see Emily looking uncomfortable.

Jake got defensive and told me I was being childish. He said he still valued our friendship but needed to prioritize his relationship now. I felt embarrassed and angry, and I shot back that he was just using Emily as an excuse to ditch me. That didn’t help the situation, and the mood turned really awkward.

Everyone sucks here,"Last week, I had a pretty intense argument with my partner, Sarah, over a recent purchase I made. For context, Sarah and I have been together for about three years, and we usually try to keep our finances intertwined. We have a joint bank account for shared expenses but also maintain separate accounts for personal spending.

A few weeks ago, I found an amazing deal on a high-end gaming laptop that I had been eyeing for a while. It was originally priced at $2,500, but it was marked down to $1,500 for a limited time. I decided to go for it, even though it was a pretty significant expense. I didn’t consult Sarah before making the purchase because I figured it fell under my personal spending limit, and I was excited about finally getting a good gaming setup.

When I brought the laptop home, Sarah was shocked and upset. She felt that I should have discussed such a big purchase with her first since we usually make financial decisions together. I explained to her that I understood her perspective but also felt like I deserved to treat myself after working hard and saving for it. I thought it was a reasonable decision considering I had the funds available in my personal account, which I had contributed to through my freelance work.

Sarah then brought up some of our recent expenses, like a vacation we took last summer and the new furniture we bought together. She felt that I was being selfish by prioritizing my gaming laptop over our shared goals. I argued that I had been responsible with our finances and that she also had her own personal purchases that I never questioned, like her new smartphone and those expensive concert tickets.

The conversation escalated, and we ended up saying some hurtful things to each other. I accused her of being too controlling with our money, while she called me inconsiderate and immature. In the heat of the moment, I told her that if she didn’t support my decision, then maybe I should have kept my finances completely separate and not included her in anything. That really hurt her feelings, and I realized later that I might have been too harsh.

Everyone sucks here,"I'm on mobile, so please excuse any typos or weird formatting.

A few weeks ago, I had a big argument with my roommate over our shared living space. We had been living together for over a year, and it started off great, but lately, things have become tense. I was really frustrated because she never does her share of the chores, and I feel like I'm always picking up after her. 

One night, I snapped and confronted her about it. I told her how I felt overwhelmed and that it wasn't fair for me to do all the cleaning while she just lounged around. She got defensive and accused me of being controlling and overreacting. Instead of backing down, I ended up saying some hurtful things about her laziness and how I was starting to regret living with her. 

After our argument, we both just stewed in our anger for a couple of days without speaking. I eventually apologized, but I think I hurt her feelings pretty badly, and she didn’t really accept my apology. Now things feel super awkward between us, and we don’t know how to move forward.

Everyone sucks here,"As the title suggests, my sibling and I had a pretty explosive argument last night, and I’m not sure who was in the wrong.

For some context, I (28F) am the older sister of my 25-year-old brother. We’ve always had a bit of a competitive relationship, which has only escalated since he graduated from college and started his career. I’ve been in my job for a few years now, and I put a lot of effort into my work, which has paid off in terms of promotions and recognition.

Recently, my brother has started to feel insecure about his own career path, especially since he’s been struggling to find a job in his field. He often talks about how he feels like a failure compared to me, and I’ve tried to reassure him that it’s okay to take time to figure things out. However, I also feel like he uses it as an excuse to not put in the effort to look for jobs, which frustrates me.

Last night, we were at a family dinner, and the topic of work came up. My brother made a comment about how I must think I’m better than him because I’m more successful. I tried to brush it off, but he kept pushing it, saying I had it easy and didn’t understand what he was going through. I felt my temper rising because I’ve worked hard for everything I have, and I snapped. I told him that he needed to stop blaming others for his problems and take responsibility for his own life.

After that, things escalated quickly. He started yelling back at me about how I’m condescending and act like I’m perfect just because I have a stable job. I yelled that he was being childish and needed to grow up. We both ended up storming off, and the rest of the dinner was pretty tense.

Now, I feel bad about how things went down, but I also think he needs to stop playing the victim. I’m torn about whether I was justified in losing my cool or if I just made things worse.

Am I the asshole for yelling at my brother during our argument about his career? 

TLDR: I yelled at my brother for blaming me for his career struggles at a family dinner, and now I’m wondering if I overreacted.",468,1779,0.93,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_61919,2022-01-27 00:00:00,ESH,2051,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Last weekend, my brother and his girlfriend came over to visit my wife and me. We hadn’t seen them in a while, so we were looking forward to catching up. However, things took a turn when my brother’s girlfriend, Claire, started making comments about our home. 

It started off innocently enough, but then she began critiquing our decor, saying things like, “You really like that painting, huh?” in a tone that felt pretty condescending. I tried to brush it off, but it was getting under my skin. My wife noticed and tried to steer the conversation towards something more positive, but Claire kept going, making little snide remarks about our furniture and how we could ""definitely use some style tips.""

After a while, I’d had enough. When she said something about our choice of dinner plates being “boring,” I snapped and said, “You know, not everyone needs to have a Pinterest-perfect home. Maybe if you focused less on critiquing and more on enjoying the visit, you’d have a better time.” 

The room went silent. My brother looked shocked, and Claire’s face went red. She shot back, “Well, maybe if you weren’t so defensive, you could take a joke!” Things escalated quickly from there, with my brother trying to mediate but only making it worse. Eventually, they left in a huff, and my wife was upset with me for blowing up and ruining the evening.

We ended up arguing about it later; she said I overreacted and should have just ignored her comments. I argued that I was justified in standing up for our home. It left a tense atmosphere between us for the rest of the night, and now my brother hasn’t reached out since.

Last week, I had a pretty rough day myself. I had a big presentation at work that didn’t go well, and I was feeling really down about it. I decided to call Sarah to vent a little, hoping she could offer some encouragement. However, when I called her, she was in the middle of a crisis of her own, dealing with a difficult boss and some team drama. I could hear that she was upset, but I was feeling pretty raw and just started unloading about my day.

Sarah tried to share what she was going through, but I kept interrupting her, focused on my own feelings. I didn’t mean to be dismissive, but I was just in such a bad headspace that I couldn’t think about anything else. At one point, she snapped at me, saying something like, “Can I just have a moment to talk about my issues without you making it all about you?” It caught me off guard, and instead of apologizing, I responded defensively, claiming that I was just trying to get support from her.

The argument escalated, and we both ended up saying hurtful things. I accused her of not being there for me when I needed her, while she said I was being selfish and didn’t care about her struggles. Ultimately, I hung up on her, feeling frustrated and hurt, but I also felt guilty for how I treated her.

A few hours later, I realized that I had overstepped and that she needed support too. I sent her a message apologizing, but she didn’t respond for a while. When she finally did, it was clear that she was still upset. I wanted to make amends, but I was still feeling a bit hurt myself, so I ended up sending a message saying I would give her space but that I still felt she could have been more understanding.

Now, we’re both just sitting in our feelings, and the friendship feels strained. I feel bad for how I acted, but I also feel like she could have been more supportive considering my bad day. AITA?",486,854,0.51,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_59419,2024-04-16 00:00:00,ESH,2121,AITA

He lost his job and has been really down about it. I tried to support him as best as I could, offering to hang out and talk, but he seemed to withdraw more and more. 

One day, he confided in me that he was really struggling financially and was on the verge of losing his apartment. I felt really bad for him, so I offered to loan him some money to help him get back on his feet. He seemed grateful at first, but then he started to act really weird. He would ghost me for days at a time and then pop back up acting as if nothing had happened.

After a few weeks, I noticed that he was posting on social media about going out to eat and hanging out with other friends. This really upset me because I had helped him out during a time when he said he needed it most. When I confronted him about it, he brushed it off, saying he deserved to treat himself after everything he had been through.

Feeling frustrated and betrayed, I decided to stop being supportive and cut ties for a while. I told him that I felt he didn’t appreciate my help and that he was being irresponsible with the money I lent him. He got really defensive and accused me of abandoning him when he needed support the most.

In the end, I felt guilty for not being there for him, but I also felt justified in not wanting to be taken advantage of.

He constantly checks her phone, tells her who she can and can’t hang out with, and makes comments about her appearance that feel more like insults than compliments. 

One night, we were all hanging out at my place, and Mark started making fun of Sarah for wanting to go back to school. He said she was wasting her time and should just focus on him and their relationship. I tried to speak up and say that it’s great she wants to improve herself, but Mark just laughed me off and said I was just jealous because I was single.

Later, I confronted Sarah about Mark's behavior. I told her I was worried about how he treats her, and she got really defensive. She said I was just bitter because I wasn’t in a relationship and that Mark loved her in his own way. In frustration, I may have said that she was being naive and that she deserved better than a guy who belittles her dreams.

That night, Sarah ended up leaving in tears, and I felt bad, but I also felt like I needed to stand up for her. Now, I feel torn because I know I was trying to help, but I might have come off as a jerk for how I addressed the situation.

My sister, Lisa, is five years younger than me and has always been the center of attention during her birthdays.

This year, my birthday fell on the same day as a big family event for Lisa—her high school graduation party. My parents planned a combined celebration, which meant my birthday was kind of brushed aside. I understood it was a big milestone for her, but I felt my birthday was being diminished. When I mentioned to my parents that I would prefer a separate celebration, they brushed me off, saying I was being selfish and that it was a ""family celebration.""

At the party, as everyone was celebrating Lisa's achievements, I felt increasingly left out. After the graduation speech, I made a joke about how my birthday was getting overshadowed, but instead of laughs, I got awkward silence. I then blurted out that I wasn’t going to celebrate my birthday at all since no one cared. It was a bit dramatic, I know, but I was really frustrated.

Lisa started to cry, saying I was ruining her day, and my parents got mad at me for making her upset. I felt guilty, but at the same time, I was tired of being overlooked. Afterward, my parents told me I should just be happy for her and that my feelings didn’t matter as much on her special day.

Honestly, looking back, I could have handled the situation better, and maybe I should have let it go. But I also feel like my family just doesn’t see me. It’s a mess, and now I feel like I made things worse for everyone.

So here's the deal: My friend Sam and I have been really close for years, and we usually hang out every weekend. Last Saturday, we decided to have a small get-together at my place with a few other friends. I had some snacks and drinks, and it was all going well until Sam started acting a bit off. 

As the night went on, Sam got progressively more intoxicated and started making jokes at my expense, which honestly didn't bother me at first. But then he crossed a line and made a joke about something that really hurt me—a sensitive topic I’m not comfortable discussing. I was upset and told him to stop, but he laughed it off, thinking it was all in good fun.

After that, I decided to confront him more seriously, and I raised my voice a bit, which I realize now was not the best approach. But I was frustrated and wanted him to understand how hurtful his comments were. Instead of taking my feelings into account, he just got defensive and ended up saying some really mean things back to me, including some personal jabs.

Everyone sucks here,"I’m in my late 30s and have a close-knit group of friends that I’ve known since high school. Recently, we decided to plan a weekend getaway together for the first time in years. We booked a cabin in the mountains and everyone was excited. 

As the planning went on, we agreed that everyone would contribute to the food and drinks. I offered to prepare a big breakfast for everyone on the first morning, and everyone seemed on board with that. However, one of my friends, Sarah, has dietary restrictions – she’s vegan and gluten-free. I told her I’d make sure there were options for her, and she seemed satisfied with that.

When we got to the cabin, I spent a lot of time cooking and preparing a big spread for everyone. I made pancakes, eggs, and bacon, but I also included a vegan option with tofu and gluten-free pancakes for Sarah. However, I didn’t really consult with her about the specifics of what she could eat. I figured I knew enough about her dietary needs to accommodate her.

When breakfast was served, Sarah looked at the spread and seemed frustrated. She pointed out that some of the items I made, like the pancakes, were made with regular flour, and she couldn’t eat them. I felt a bit defensive because I had made a separate vegan option, but I hadn’t considered that the non-vegan items could still be problematic for her. I told her that I thought I was being considerate and that it was her responsibility to communicate her needs better.

This turned into a heated argument, with Sarah saying I didn’t care enough to really think about her needs, and I countered that she should have spoken up more clearly beforehand. The others in the group got caught in the middle, trying to calm us down, and it turned into a huge mess.

In retrospect, I should have taken more time to clarify her needs instead of assuming I knew what would work for her. But I also felt like she could have been clearer about what she could and couldn’t eat.

In the moment, I responded with a sarcastic remark about how he should teach me to cook if he’s so great at it. I thought it would lighten the mood, but instead, he got defensive and started listing off all the things he could cook, as if to prove a point.

A while back, my partner expressed a strong desire to start a small vegetable garden in our backyard. I’m all for gardening and fresh produce, but I had a few reservations. First, I have a busy schedule, and I worried that maintaining a garden would be too much work for us. Second, I’m not a fan of bugs or dirt, so the whole idea kind of turned me off.

I voiced my concerns, but she was really passionate about it and insisted that it would be a fun project for us. I reluctantly agreed to help her get started, thinking it wouldn’t be too bad. Fast forward to the summer, and the garden has become a full-time job. She was out there every day, and while I did help her set it up, I’ve mostly been standing on the sidelines watching her do all the work.

As the plants grew, they started attracting bugs, which I absolutely cannot stand. I told her I didn’t want to deal with the bugs and that I felt overwhelmed by the whole situation, but she insisted that it was all part of the gardening experience. I started to get frustrated, and my annoyance showed. I often made sarcastic comments about the garden and how much I hated the bugs.

One day, after a particularly long workday, I came home to find her trying to harvest a bunch of veggies. I snapped at her about the garden being a pest magnet and how I didn’t sign up for this. I ended up saying some pretty harsh things, like how her obsession with the garden was ruining our backyard space and that I wished she’d just stick to buying vegetables from the store.

She was hurt, and I felt bad afterward, but I also felt trapped because I had been trying to express my feelings about the whole situation for weeks. I know I could have handled it better, and I probably shouldn’t have lashed out. But on the other hand, I feel like she didn’t really consider my discomfort and just went ahead with the garden without thinking about how it would affect me.

Everyone sucks here,"I (28M) have been friends with Sarah (27F) for a few years now. We met through mutual friends and got close over time. Sarah has always battled with her self-esteem, and I've tried to be supportive, whether it was listening to her vent about her job or encouraging her to pursue her hobbies. Recently, she decided to take up painting, and I thought it was an amazing outlet for her to express herself.

A few months ago, she invited me to an art show where she was displaying some of her work. I was excited and promised to go. However, when the day came, I had a last-minute work obligation that required my attention. I felt terrible about not being able to attend, especially since it was important to her.

To make it up to her, I offered to take her out for dinner the following weekend, my treat. She agreed, but then a few days later, she mentioned that she wanted to invite a few other friends along for the dinner, which I was fine with at first. However, she then added that she expected me to cover the whole bill since I had ""invited everyone.""

I felt frustrated. I didn’t mind paying for her, but I didn’t think it was right to cover the dinner for more people than I initially agreed to. I told her I would pay for her and one other person, but that was it. She got upset and accused me of being unsupportive and selfish for not wanting to treat her friends too. I tried to explain my side, but the conversation turned into an argument, and we ended up not talking for a week.

After some time apart, I reached out to apologize for the way I handled things, but I still felt resentful about how she expected me to shoulder more than I was comfortable with. She also admitted she was hurt I didn't show up to her art show, and I realized we were both holding onto hard feelings.

In the end, we both agreed we could have communicated better and should have approached the situation with more understanding. However, I can't shake the feeling that we both share some blame in how things went down.",190,503,0.56,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_21360,2020-05-07 00:00:00,ESH,2010,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I’m a graduate student and recently found myself in a tough situation with my roommate, who I’ll call Alex. We share a small apartment, and money has been tight for both of us. We've made a pact to help each other out, but things have been escalating.

A few weeks ago, I discovered that Alex had been borrowing my things without asking. At first, it was just some books and kitchen supplies. I’m usually pretty lenient, but then I found out that Alex had taken my laptop charger and a couple of my favorite kitchen gadgets without telling me. I was really frustrated because I rely on those items, especially for my studies and cooking.

One night, I came home after a long day and found that Alex had hosted a small gathering with friends. I was too exhausted to care about the noise at first, but when I walked into the kitchen, I noticed that my stuff was scattered all over the place, and my favorite cooking knife was missing. I confronted Alex about it, and he shrugged it off, saying he thought I wouldn’t mind.

That’s when I lost my cool. I took it upon myself to go through his things and found my knife in his drawer along with other items I recognized as mine. Instead of just taking my stuff back, I decided to make a point. I took a handful of his snacks and drinks from the fridge and tossed them into the trash. I was angry and thought it would send the message that he shouldn’t just take my stuff without asking.

The next day, Alex was furious when he discovered what I had done. He yelled at me, saying I was overreacting and that we’re supposed to help each other out. I argued back that he was being inconsiderate and that I felt disrespected.

In the end, we both ended up saying hurtful things to each other and the atmosphere in our apartment turned really tense. We both felt wronged—me for having my stuff taken, and him for having his snacks thrown away.

I need some perspective on a situation that happened recently with my best friend, Sarah. We’ve been friends for over a decade, and I’ve always been there for her through thick and thin. Recently, she started dating this new guy, and I was really happy for her. However, I noticed that every time we hung out, she’d be glued to her phone, texting him or scrolling through social media. It felt like I was hanging out with a ghost, and I started to express my frustration.

One day, after her ignoring me for the umpteenth time, I jokingly said, “Are you dating him or are you still my friend?” It was meant to be light-hearted, but she snapped back, saying I was being ridiculous and that I should be happy for her. I got defensive and told her that I never expected her to drop everything for me, but a little attention wouldn’t hurt. 

We ended up getting into a heated argument, and I said some hurtful things about how I didn’t think he was good for her because he seemed controlling (which I only saw through a few texts). Sarah got really upset and said I was being possessive and that she couldn’t believe I was trying to ruin her happiness. 

After that, we didn’t talk for a couple of weeks. I felt bad for how I reacted, but I also felt like I had a point. Eventually, we reached out to each other and talked it over, but there’s definitely some tension now.

So, I’m wondering, am I the asshole for expressing my concern about her new relationship, or was she overreacting to my joke?

Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I have been together for about a year, and lately, we've been having some issues with communication. One day, we were having dinner with a group of friends, and the topic of conversation shifted to past relationships. I made a comment about how I found it strange when people stay in touch with their exes, saying something along the lines of, ""I just think it's awkward. Like, why would you want to keep talking to someone you used to date?"" 

My partner reacted immediately, saying that I was being judgmental and that some people can have healthy friendships with their exes. I felt like I was just sharing my opinion, so I pushed back, saying that it seemed pretty common sense to me. The conversation escalated, and my partner accused me of being insensitive to their past experiences, mentioning that they've remained friends with an ex and that I was disrespecting their choices.

Things got heated, and I ended up saying, ""Well, if that’s how you feel, maybe you should just go back to your ex then!"" It was a harsh thing to say, and I immediately regretted it, but it just came out in the heat of the moment. My partner was hurt, and they left the table in tears.

Afterward, I tried to apologize, but my partner felt like I was being insincere because I had pushed the conversation to that point to begin with. They said that my words were damaging, and I should have been more considerate of their feelings. I feel like I shouldn’t have had to censor my opinion just to keep the peace, but I recognize that I could have chosen my words more carefully. 

Now, we're both feeling hurt and frustrated, and I’m wondering if I was out of line for expressing my thoughts or if my partner overreacted to a difference of opinion.

Recently, one of my friends, Sarah (27F), started dating a guy, Jake (28M), who has a reputation for being a bit of a player. We all warned her about him, but she insisted that he was different and that we should just trust her judgment.

Fast forward a couple of months, and Sarah is head over heels, but things start to take a turn. Jake begins to get distant, and Sarah confides in us about some red flags she’s noticed. I felt frustrated because I genuinely care about her and wanted her to see that he might not be the right guy for her. So, I took it upon myself to gather some evidence about Jake's behavior and shared it with our friend group.

The group chat turned into a heated debate. I posted screenshots of his old social media posts and comments from other girls, trying to prove my point that he wasn't to be trusted. Sarah found out about what I shared and was furious. She accused me of betraying her trust and trying to manipulate her into breaking up with him. 

In a fit of anger, Sarah confronted me in front of the group, and I ended up defending myself aggressively, saying that I was just looking out for her. This led to a big argument, and now our whole friend group is split. Some think I was right to be concerned, while others think I overstepped my boundaries.

Last month, my younger brother, who’s 17, asked if he could borrow my car for a weekend road trip with his friends. I was hesitant because he’s not the most responsible driver, but he promised he’d be careful and even said he’d fill up the gas tank. I reluctantly agreed, thinking he’d be okay.

Fast forward to Sunday night when he returns, and I immediately notice a scratch on the side of my car. I confront him about it, and he brushes it off, saying it’s just a small thing and it’ll buff out. I was furious and told him that he should have taken better care of my property. He started getting defensive, saying I was overreacting and that it was just a car.

Things escalated, and I ended up shouting at him, saying he was careless and disrespectful. He fired back, saying I’m too uptight and I should just chill out. In the heat of the moment, I called him a “spoiled brat” and told him he doesn’t appreciate anything I do for him. It was a low blow, and I felt bad afterward.

We both ended up storming off to our rooms, and now there’s this tension between us. I know I shouldn’t have lost my temper like that, but I feel like he disrespected my trust by not taking care of my car. I’m just not sure if I was wrong for being upset or if he was being irresponsible.

However, I’ve recently been feeling insecure about my weight, as I’ve gained some during the pandemic and have been finding it hard to lose it.

Last weekend, we were at a mutual friend’s birthday party, and after a few drinks, I jokingly commented on how I needed to get back in shape. Sarah, in her typical playful manner, replied, “Yeah, well, you know what they say, you can’t out-exercise a bad diet. Maybe just stick to salads instead of pizza next time!”

I felt embarrassed and hurt, and while I know she didn’t mean it maliciously, it stung. In response, I snapped back, “At least I’m not a size zero with an eating disorder. But hey, you do you!” 

The room went silent, and I could see the shock on her face. I felt bad immediately, but the alcohol had loosened my tongue, and in that moment of frustration, I just let it out. Sarah walked away, visibly upset, and later told me that I had crossed a line.

After the party, we exchanged a few messages where she expressed how hurtful my comment was, and I admitted that I shouldn’t have responded that way, but I also felt like her initial comment was insensitive given my feelings about my body.

However, my best friend (30F) got really upset when she found out about the party. She’s been going through a tough time at work and mentioned that she didn’t want to celebrate anything right now because it felt too painful for her. I totally get that she’s struggling; I’ve been there too. But I feel like I also deserve to celebrate my achievements without feeling guilty about her situation.

I tried to explain to her that this party was about me and my accomplishment, and I really wanted her to be there. I thought it would be a good distraction for her, but she wasn’t having it. She accused me of being insensitive for throwing a celebration when she’s feeling down, and said that I should have postponed it until she felt better. I felt guilty, but at the same time, I haven’t done anything wrong by wanting to celebrate my success.

However, she had a tendency to dominate the conversation, and over time, I noticed that other members were becoming quieter.

I admire her dedication, but I’ve always been more of a casual gym-goer and enjoy my food a little too much to limit myself.

One day, Sarah invited me to join her for a kickboxing class. I was hesitant at first because I’m not very coordinated, but I agreed, wanting to support her and maybe even enjoy the experience. After the class, we went out for lunch. Sarah suggested a health food place, and I was fine with that, though I would’ve preferred something less restrictive.

I made a joking comment about how I could never give up pizza, and she immediately launched into a mini lecture about how unhealthy it is and how I should try to be more mindful about my eating habits. I felt a bit embarrassed, but I laughed it off.

I told him that it felt irresponsible to spend money on luxuries when he didn’t have a stable income yet.

I felt hurt that he painted me as the bad guy when I was just trying to look out for him. In retaliation, I sent him a message saying he was being spoiled and needed to grow up. 

That led to a heated exchange where we both said some pretty hurtful things. He called me condescending and I accused him of being a child who refuses to take responsibility for his life. Our parents had to step in to mediate, which was embarrassing for everyone involved.

We both agreed when we moved in that we would take turns with chores, but lately, I've felt like I've been doing most of the work. I asked my roommate if we could come up with a more structured cleaning schedule so it would feel fairer.

Instead of discussing it, my roommate got defensive and said I was being controlling. I was frustrated and pointed out the mess in the living room and kitchen, saying it was disrespectful to leave it like that when I put in the effort to keep things tidy. Maybe I shouldn’t have said it that way, but I felt like I was being taken for granted.

In response, my roommate snapped back and said they had a busy week and couldn't help it. They accused me of being uptight and that I should just let things go sometimes. I argued that it wasn’t about being uptight; it was about living in a clean space. 

We ended up having a pretty heated argument, and I told them I was tired of picking up after them.

My sister and I were both involved in her care, but we approached it very differently.

There was a particularly tense moment when my sister insisted on throwing a big family gathering at our mom's house to ""boost her spirits."" I thought it was a terrible idea because my mom was really tired and needed rest. I expressed my concerns to my sister and suggested we keep visits limited to a few close family members instead. This led to a huge argument where I ended up yelling at her, telling her she was being selfish and needed to think about our mom's health instead of her own feelings.

In retaliation, my sister decided to go ahead with the gathering anyway, and she didn't tell me until the day before. I was furious and ended up showing up uninvited, which made things even more chaotic. During the gathering, I confronted my sister in front of everyone, and we got into a shouting match.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I've been friends with Sarah for a few years now, and we've always had each other's backs. Recently, she started dating Mark, and I've met him a couple of times. He seems like a nice guy, but I can tell that Sarah is a bit hesitant to introduce him to her family. She's mentioned that they can be a bit judgmental, especially about her dating choices.

Last weekend, we all went to a party together, and Sarah was anxious about how her family would react to Mark being there. I thought it was a bit overblown, but I didn't want to push her. However, as the night went on, I noticed that Mark was really trying to connect with her family, and they seemed to enjoy his company.

At one point, Sarah stepped away to grab some drinks, and I saw an opportunity to lighten the mood. I jokingly turned to Mark and said something like, ""So, are you ready for the interrogation that is Sarah's family?"" I thought it would get a laugh, but instead, he looked a bit uncomfortable. 

When Sarah came back, she overheard what I said and was visibly upset. She told me that she wanted to keep her relationship with Mark more private until she felt ready to share it with her family. I felt bad, but I also thought she was being a bit dramatic. After all, Mark had been handling himself well with her family, and it seemed like they were warming up to him.

Later on, Sarah confronted me about making her relationship feel like a joke in front of Mark and her family. I tried to explain that I was just trying to lighten the mood, but she said that I was dismissing her feelings and putting pressure on her. I told her she should just be more upfront about her relationship if it meant so much to her, but that didn't help.

Recently, we decided to take a weekend trip to the beach, something we've both been looking forward to for months. We had booked an Airbnb and were excited to relax and enjoy each other's company.

A week before the trip, Sarah mentioned that she was feeling anxious about it. She had a lot on her plate with work and personal issues, and she wasn’t sure if she could fully enjoy the trip. I tried to reassure her and suggested we could adjust our plans or take it easy while we were there. I thought a break would really do her good.

However, when we arrived at the beach, Sarah’s anxiety seemed to escalate. Instead of relaxing, she spent most of our first day in the Airbnb, scrolling on her phone and not engaging with me. I tried to include her by suggesting activities, but she just kept saying she wasn't feeling up for it. Frustrated, I decided to go out exploring on my own, thinking some time apart might help her unwind. 

When I got back to the Airbnb, Sarah was upset that I had gone out without her. I explained that I felt like I was missing out on the trip, and I didn’t want to stay stuck inside if she didn’t want to join me. She snapped at me, saying I was being inconsiderate and that she had hoped I would have been more understanding of her feelings.

I felt bad for leaving her behind, but I also believed I deserved to have fun on the trip. The next day, we had a huge argument about it. We both ended up saying hurtful things. I told her she was being overly dramatic, and she accused me of being selfish for wanting to enjoy the vacation without considering her feelings. 

In the end, the trip turned out to be awkward, and we couldn't agree on how to make it work. Now I’m left wondering if I should have just stayed by her side instead of trying to enjoy myself. AITA?",275,2797,0.54,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_38360,2020-03-26 00:00:00,ESH,1893,AITA

My friend, Jake, has been going through a rough patch and has relied heavily on the rest of us for support. While I care about him, I started feeling overwhelmed because it seemed like his problems consumed every group outing and conversation.

Last week, during our usual game night, Jake started talking about his latest issues with his job and relationship for the entire night. The rest of us tried to steer the conversation towards something lighter, but he kept bringing it back to his problems. I eventually snapped and told him that while I sympathize with what he's going through, we all have our struggles too, and I just wanted one night where we could enjoy our time together without it being about his problems.

This made Jake upset, and he shot back that I was being selfish for not being supportive. I felt bad for hurting his feelings, but I was also frustrated because I felt like he wasn't considering the group's needs. A couple of other friends chimed in, agreeing with me but also saying I could have been gentler in my approach.

Everyone sucks here,"Title: AITA for confronting my friend about their habit and then venting online?

Hey everyone, this is my first time posting here so I hope I’m doing this right. I’m on mobile, so please forgive any mistakes. Here’s my story, and TLDR at the end.

I (24F) have a close friend, ""Jess"" (25F), who I’ve known since high school. We’ve always had a great friendship, but recently, I've started to notice a concerning pattern. Jess has developed a habit of borrowing money from me frequently. At first, it was small amounts — like $20 here and there — but it has escalated to her asking for upwards of $100 for various reasons, like unexpected bills or ""emergencies."" 

I’ve always been happy to help, but it’s starting to feel like I’m her emergency fund. I’ve had my own financial struggles and have been saving up for a personal project, which makes it more difficult for me to keep lending her money. I finally decided to confront her about it. I brought it up casually, saying I was noticing a pattern and that it was becoming tough for me financially. 

Her reaction was defensive. She claimed I was being unsupportive and that she was just going through a rough time. I felt guilty for saying anything, but I stood my ground, explaining that I couldn’t keep helping her out like this. Jess then went on to say that if I truly cared about her, I wouldn’t mind lending her money.

Feeling frustrated, I vented about the situation on social media, mentioning how difficult it is when you want to help a friend but they keep asking for money and don’t seem to appreciate the impact on your own finances. I didn’t name her or anything specific, but I did express my feelings about it.

Later that day, Jess found out about my post and confronted me. She was very hurt and accused me of airing our private matters publicly. I tried to explain my side, but she was already upset and said I should have just talked to her instead of venting online. Now she’s not talking to me.

TLDR: I confronted my friend about her borrowing money too often, and after a tense conversation, I vented about it online. She found out and is now angry with me. Am I the asshole for confronting her and expressing my feelings publicly? I know I might not be in the right, but I’m confused about what to do next.",841,761,0.57,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_60544,2018-08-24 00:00:00,ESH,2286,AITA

I smiled, but I didn’t feel ready to make that kind of leap yet, so I shrugged it off and said, “Let’s not rush into things.”

I tried to explain that I was just being realistic since we hadn’t finalized any plans or talked about the logistics of merging our lives. 

After that, I became a bit irritated because I felt like my feelings were disregarded. I admitted I wasn’t as enthusiastic about the idea as they were and that I needed more time to think.

She spent a lot of time preparing everything, wanting it to be perfect for everyone. However, a few days before the dinner, Lily reached out to Sarah to let her know that she had recently become vegan and couldn’t eat any of the dishes Sarah was planning to make. 

Sarah was taken aback; she felt a little frustrated because she had already planned the entire menu and didn't want to make something entirely different just for one person. She told Lily that she would do her best to accommodate her but that she didn't have the time to make multiple dishes. Instead of being understanding, Lily responded by saying that it was important for her to have something to eat that aligned with her lifestyle and that she would just bring her own food.

On the day of the dinner, Sarah was busy with cooking and getting things set up. When Lily arrived, she brought a big container of her own vegan dish and made a point of placing it prominently on the table while making comments about how it was ""so much healthier"" than what everyone else was eating.

I didn’t know she was going to post it, and when I saw it, I felt blindsided. I talked to her about it and asked her to take it down, explaining that I didn’t want our relationship being broadcasted like that. She was really upset and said that I was stifling her self-expression and that my need for privacy was unreasonable. 

I held my ground, believing that I wasn’t asking for too much. I told her that I think it’s important to have boundaries, especially when it comes to something as personal as our relationship. After a heated discussion, she reluctantly took the post down, but it left a lingering tension between us. 

I realize that I may have come off as controlling, and she believes I’m being unreasonable by not wanting to share our lives with her friends and followers. I feel like we both have valid points: I want to maintain my privacy, and she wants to share her happiness. 

Now I’m wondering if I was too harsh in how I handled it, or if she was out of line for posting without my consent. AITA?",110,2454,0.93,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_43122,2021-07-24 00:00:00,ESH,1824,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My name is Alex (28M), and I’ve been in a relationship with Jenna (27F) for about 3 years. Jenna has a son named Oliver (10M) from her previous marriage. I’ve tried my best to bond with Oliver and be a good step-parent figure in his life, but it hasn’t been easy. His biological father, Jake, is often in and out of his life, and while I don’t want to overstep, I’ve stepped up when needed.

Recently, Jenna and I decided to take Oliver on a weekend trip to a theme park. He was super excited, and we spent weeks planning it. On the day of the trip, as we were about to leave, I noticed that Oliver was acting a bit distant. During the drive, I tried to engage him in conversation, but he seemed uninterested and just stared out the window.

Once we got to the park, everything changed. Initially, he was thrilled to be there, but after a few rides, he suddenly wanted to call his dad. I didn’t think much of it and told him that we’d have a great time together and that he could talk to his dad later. Oliver took this badly and started to throw a tantrum, insisting that he wanted to go home. I tried to reason with him, telling him that we had a whole day ahead of us filled with fun.

After a while of trying to coax him into enjoying the day, I snapped and said, “You need to stop acting like a baby and just enjoy the rides. We’re here to have fun, so let’s just do that!” I immediately regretted saying it, but I was frustrated because I felt like I was trying hard to make this a good day for him.

Jenna overheard me and got really angry. She told me that I shouldn’t talk to Oliver that way, and I needed to understand that he’s still processing his feelings about his dad. I apologized to Oliver right away, but the damage was done. He wouldn’t speak to me for the rest of the day, and Jenna was upset with me too. I felt like she was being too protective and didn’t see my side of things. 

At the end of the day, we ended up leaving early because Oliver didn’t want to stay anymore. Back at home, while Jenna comforted Oliver, I felt really left out. I expressed my feelings to Jenna, saying I only wanted to help and that I was just trying to make the best of a difficult situation. Jenna said that I need to learn how to be more patient and understanding, and I told her that I felt like I couldn’t do anything right.

Looking back, I know I shouldn’t have snapped at Oliver, and maybe I could have handled it better, but I also feel like Jenna could have supported me more instead of jumping down my throat. It’s a tough situation for all of us, and none of us were really at our best that day.",332,2309,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_39871,2024-06-06 00:00:00,ESH,2610,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Growing up, my parents had a tumultuous relationship that led to a divorce when I was a teenager. My mom always expressed a lot of resentment towards my dad, and I often found myself stuck in the middle, trying to keep the peace. 

Fast forward to my early 20s, my mom started dating a man named Mark, who was really nice to her but also had a reputation for being a bit of a player. I was wary of him, but I tried to be supportive. After a year of dating, my mom announced that they were engaged. I was shocked but kept my mouth shut, hoping it would work out for her.

One day, I was having a conversation with my mom about wedding plans, and she mentioned that Mark was struggling financially and couldn’t afford a ring. Without thinking, I offered her my grandmother’s ring, which my mom had always admired. I figured it would be a nice gesture and keep it in the family. She initially seemed excited about it.

However, a few weeks later, my mom called me to say she was having second thoughts about using the ring. She wanted to buy a new one instead, claiming that Mark would prefer to choose something himself. I got annoyed and told her that if she didn't want the ring, I would rather keep it for myself, as it had sentimental value to me too. 

She became defensive and accused me of being selfish, saying that I was ruining her engagement by not being supportive. In retaliation, I snapped back, saying that she was being inconsiderate of the family heirloom and how it meant a lot to me. We ended up in a heated argument, both of us saying hurtful things.

In the end, she gave Mark the ring, and I felt betrayed. I told her she was making a mistake, and she said I was being immature. I still think it was wrong to dismiss my feelings about the ring. So, am I the asshole for standing up for something that means a lot to me, even if it meant calling out my mom?",40,1424,0.67,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_81631,2021-07-29 00:00:00,ESH,1876,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Okay, so I'm new to Reddit and I'm hoping to get some input on a situation that happened recently. I’m a pretty laid-back person, but I guess I lost my cool a bit.

So, I (28F) have a younger sister (22F), and we’ve always had a bit of a competitive relationship. She’s starting her career as a makeup artist and has been getting quite a bit of attention on social media. I work in a different field, but I’ve always been supportive of her, even though I sometimes feel overshadowed.

A few weeks ago, she invited me to her birthday party, and I thought it would be a nice opportunity to celebrate and support her. However, when I got there, I noticed that she had invited a lot of her makeup artist friends, and they all started talking about their work, sharing tips, and showcasing their latest projects. I felt completely out of place and kind of invisible. 

At one point, someone asked me what I did, and I hesitated. I finally told them about my job, and instead of being supportive, my sister joked, “Oh, that sounds boring compared to what we do!” Everyone laughed, and I felt really hurt. 

In the heat of the moment, I snapped back at her, saying, “Well, at least I’m not relying on filters and makeup to get attention!” It was a low blow, and I regretted saying it immediately. The mood shifted, and my sister looked really upset. Later, she told me I ruined her birthday by making it about me.

Now, I feel bad for lashing out, but I also think it wasn’t cool of her to dismiss my career in front of everyone. We’ve both been a bit petty, and I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for what I said or if she was for how she treated me.

Everyone sucks here,"Throwaway account because my family knows my main one.

I (26F) have been living with my partner (28M) for the past year, and we’ve been together for almost three years. We generally get along well, but we have different perspectives when it comes to handling our finances, which has caused some tension.

To give you some context, I was raised in a family where money was tight, and I've always been very frugal. I prefer to save up for things rather than go into debt. My partner, on the other hand, comes from a well-off family and has a more relaxed attitude towards spending. He believes in enjoying life and indulging in experiences and things that make us happy, which I get, but sometimes it feels excessive to me.

Recently, we had a disagreement over a vacation he wanted to take. He wanted to spend a significant amount of money on a trip to a fancy resort, while I felt we should save that money for our future and maybe choose something more budget-friendly. We went back and forth on it, and eventually, I snapped. I told him that he was being irresponsible and that he needed to think long-term rather than just about immediate gratification.

Things escalated, and in the heat of the moment, I said some hurtful things, implying that his attitude towards money was immature and that he was spoiled. He got really upset, saying I was being controlling and that I should trust him to make financial decisions. I felt guilty afterward, realizing I had been too harsh, but I also felt justified in wanting to be careful with our finances.

Now, we’re both upset with each other, and it’s created an awkward tension at home. I regret how I spoke to him, but I also think he needs to be more mindful about our financial situation. 

So, AITA for how I handled the argument about spending money on the vacation?",107,977,0.75,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_56907,2018-01-17 00:00:00,ESH,1820,AITA

I didn’t think it would be a big deal, but when I told my original friend about my new plans, they got really upset. They said I had betrayed them by going with someone else, even though I had encouraged them to take the job.

I felt like I had a right to enjoy the weekend, but I also understood their feelings. So, we ended up arguing over text, and I said some hurtful things about how they should have prioritized our plans over work. They retaliated by saying I was being selfish and didn’t care about our friendship.

I had already said I wasn’t interested, but she didn’t seem to get the hint. In a moment of frustration, I snapped and told her that not everyone can afford to eat like a fitness influencer or has the time to meal prep all day. 

She got really upset and accused me of being jealous and negative. I told her it’s not jealousy; I just want her to be more mindful of how her words affect others. Her response was to double down, saying that if I truly cared about my health, I would be more open to her advice. 

We ended up having a pretty heated exchange, and I told her that she was being condescending and that she needed to respect other people's choices. Afterward, I felt bad for how I handled it, but I still think she should have been more considerate.

Everyone sucks here,"My story starts a few months ago when my brother and his girlfriend moved in with me temporarily after they had some financial issues. I was happy to help them out, but I also had some boundaries in place. One of those boundaries was that I didn't want them using my kitchen after a certain time in the evening since I have a strict routine and I go to bed early.

At first, everything seemed fine, but a few weeks in, I started noticing that they were still cooking late at night. I would hear pots and pans clanging and the smell of food wafting into my room, which was really disrupting my sleep. I brought it up with them, expressing how it was affecting my rest, and asked them to please respect my request. They nodded and said they understood.

However, a couple of nights later, they did it again. This time, I was really frustrated. I decided to confront them again but it turned into a heated argument. My brother insisted that it was their right to use the kitchen whenever they wanted since they were living there and that I was being unreasonable. I told him that I was the one paying the bills and that they needed to respect my space.

In the heat of the moment, I shouted that if they couldn’t follow the rules, they should move out. That made things really tense.

We share a lot of personal stuff, and we’ve been there for each other through tough times. Recently, Jake started dating someone named Mia, and they seem really happy together. 

Last week, I was hanging out at Jake's place when he received a message from Mia. I didn’t mean to eavesdrop, but I overheard him reading it out loud to himself. The message was a bit flirtatious, and it made me uncomfortable because I know Jake has always been serious about relationships. I thought it was strange since he usually keeps his dating life private.

Later that night, while we were playing video games, I casually asked Jake about Mia and how things were going. He seemed really happy and talked a lot about her. Then, I jokingly mentioned the message I overheard. Instead of laughing it off, Jake got defensive and said it was a private conversation and that I shouldn't be listening in. I felt embarrassed and said I didn’t mean to overhear it; I just thought we were close enough that he could share things like that with me.

The conversation escalated, and I started questioning whether he thought it was okay to engage in flirty texting when he’s in a committed relationship. I told him that I was just looking out for him, and he got really upset, saying I was overstepping and that relationships are personal and he didn’t need my judgment. I pushed back, saying that as a friend, I had a right to express my concerns.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I've been working at this small marketing agency for about six months now, and I share an office with a colleague, Sarah, who has been there for over three years. Sarah is quite experienced in the field, but she can be a bit condescending at times, especially when I ask questions. I usually try to figure things out on my own, but sometimes I genuinely need her input.

A couple of weeks ago, we had a big project due, and I was struggling with my part. I asked Sarah for help, and instead of providing guidance, she just rolled her eyes and said I should ""know better by now.""

After that, I decided I was going to do everything on my own without asking her for any help, even if it meant taking longer or making mistakes. The project deadline was approaching, and I intentionally avoided asking her for anything, even when I was stuck. When the day of the presentation came, I delivered my part, but it wasn't as polished as it could have been, and I could tell Sarah was smirking during my presentation.

Later, when we got feedback from our boss, I received some constructive criticism, and Sarah, instead of being supportive, pointed out all my mistakes in front of everyone, making it clear that she thought I was incompetent. I snapped back and said she was not helping at all when I asked for guidance earlier and that maybe if she had taken the time to actually mentor me instead of belittling me, I wouldn't have struggled so much.

Mark made a few offhand comments about how Sarah should dress and how she should handle her job, which felt a bit controlling. I brought it up to Sarah privately, and she brushed it off, saying he was just being playful and that I didn’t really understand their dynamic.

The next evening, things took a turn. We were all watching a movie, and Mark made a crude joke about women and cooking. I was offended and spoke up, saying it was disrespectful. Sarah looked embarrassed, and Mark laughed it off, saying I was too sensitive. I snapped back, saying that I didn’t appreciate his jokes and that he should know better.

It was super awkward, and while most of us laughed it off initially, we all felt uncomfortable afterwards.

Recently, we had a team-building retreat where we were supposed to bond and get to know each other better.

My friend agreed and mentioned that maybe we should talk to our manager about it since Jake seems to be getting worse.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I’m trying to figure out if I’m the asshole in this situation that happened recently. Here’s the deal: My best friend ""Mike"" and I have been friends for years, and we’ve always had a pretty laid-back relationship. We joke around a lot, and we’re both pretty sarcastic. Recently, he started dating ""Sarah,"" who I hadn’t met until a few weeks ago.

The first time we all hung out, I noticed that Sarah is pretty sensitive and doesn’t seem to take jokes as well as Mike and I do. Still, I wanted to keep things fun, so I decided to joke around a bit, trying to include her in our dynamic. I made a comment about how Mike would probably still be single if he didn’t lower his standards. Sarah didn’t laugh and looked visibly uncomfortable. I thought it was just nerves, so I continued with my teasing.

Later, I made a joke about how Mike’s cooking was terrible and that I hoped she wouldn’t starve to death. Sarah didn’t find that funny either, and she abruptly left the room, saying she needed some air. Mike followed her, and I could hear them arguing about how I was being disrespectful. When they came back, Mike was clearly upset and confronted me about my jokes. He said that I needed to be more considerate of Sarah’s feelings and that I was ruining the vibe.

I felt like I was just trying to be funny and hang out with my best friend, but I also could see that Sarah was genuinely hurt. I didn’t mean to upset her, but I didn’t think my jokes were that bad. I tried to apologize, but it felt like it just made things worse.

Now, I’m feeling conflicted. I think I might have crossed a line, but at the same time, I feel like Mike overreacted and could have talked to me about it privately instead of making a scene. I’m wondering if we’re both being unreasonable in our own ways. So, AITA for making those jokes, or was Mike overreacting?",473,2203,0.77,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_61821,2021-09-21 00:00:00,ESH,1848,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"A few weeks ago, my grandmother passed away. She was a huge part of my life, and the loss hit me hard. My family and I have been grieving together, and it’s been tough.

During this time, my cousin, who was really close to her as well, came to stay with us for a few days. We’ve always had a good relationship, but I never thought of him in a romantic way until recently. We both found comfort in each other amidst our grief, and one night, while reminiscing about our grandmother, we ended up kissing and eventually slept together.

The next day, things felt awkward. We both were mourning and agreed it was a mistake, but we had a hard time navigating our feelings. I later confided in my sister about what happened, not thinking it would go any further. Unfortunately, she told our parents, and they were furious. They felt that we disrespected our grandmother’s memory and that it was wrong to get involved like that, especially during such a sensitive time.

Now, my cousin and I are barely speaking and my family is divided. I feel torn because I truly loved my grandmother and didn’t mean any harm. I know we both acted impulsively, but I also believe it was a moment of vulnerability. My parents think I’m selfish for not considering the family dynamic, while I think they’re overreacting to a situation born out of grief.

Everyone sucks here,"I live in a small town where everyone knows each other, and I have a close-knit group of friends. Recently, my friend Sarah started dating a new guy named Mark. At first, we were all supportive, but over time, I started to notice some red flags. Mark has a history of being manipulative and controlling in past relationships, and I overheard him speaking condescendingly to Sarah on several occasions. I shared my concerns with a couple of close friends in our group, but they didn’t think it was a big deal.

One night, we all went out for drinks, and Mark was there. He started making inappropriate jokes at Sarah's expense, which made her visibly uncomfortable. I tried to brush it off at first, thinking maybe he was just trying to be funny, but as the night went on, it became clearer that he was intentionally trying to belittle her. I finally had enough and confronted him about it in front of everyone, telling him he was out of line. This led to a heated argument where Mark started yelling at me, and I yelled back that he needed to treat Sarah with respect.

After that night, Sarah was upset with me for embarrassing Mark and causing a scene. She felt caught in the middle and told me I should have taken her aside and talked to her privately instead of confronting him in front of everyone. I felt justified in wanting to stand up for her, but I also realized I may have escalated the situation unnecessarily. 

Eventually, Sarah broke up with Mark, but she hasn’t talked to me much since. My friends are divided; some think I did the right thing, while others feel I overstepped.

Everyone sucks here,"So, this all started over a group project for one of my classes. I was assigned to work with three other students, and right from the beginning, one of them, let’s call her Sarah, was really disorganized and didn’t seem to care much about the project. The rest of us were pretty stressed out because we had a tight deadline and wanted to do well.

I tried to encourage Sarah to keep up and offered to help her, but she kept making excuses and didn’t contribute much. After a few days of this, I snapped. I sent a group chat message that said something along the lines of, ""If you can’t handle this simple project, maybe you should reconsider how you’re managing your time or even if you should be in this class."" I was frustrated, and it felt like I was doing all the work while she was just coasting along.

Sarah ended up getting really upset, and I felt bad, but I also thought she needed to hear it. The other two group members chimed in, saying I was too harsh and that we should be supportive. I argued back, saying that we were in a team and everyone needed to pull their weight. This led to an even bigger argument where I ended up saying that maybe she was just lazy and didn’t care about her education.

In the end, we managed to finish the project, but it was a tense experience, and Sarah seemed really hurt. I felt guilty afterwards, but at the same time, I thought I was justified in my frustration because teamwork requires everyone to contribute.

Everyone sucks here,"I (30F) have a younger brother (25M) who has been living with me for the past year after he lost his job. I’ve been supportive, covering his portion of the rent and helping him with groceries. However, I’ve recently noticed that he’s been very careless with money. He spends a lot on takeout and video games, and I’ve even caught him ordering expensive items online that I know he can’t afford.

I talked to him about it a few weeks ago, expressing my concerns and urging him to be more responsible. I suggested he cook at home more and limit his spending, but he brushed me off, saying that he’s “just enjoying life” and doesn’t want to live in constant stress.

Last week, I received a notice from our landlord about rent being overdue. I was furious because I had given him money for his share of the rent, but he had used it for other things. In a moment of anger, I told him that if he didn’t pay me back the money I gave him, I would kick him out and he could find his own place. He was shocked and hurt, saying I was being heartless.

I understand that I shouldn’t have threatened him like that, but I feel justified in wanting him to learn responsibility. I also know he’s struggling, but I’m at my wit’s end. I’ve since apologized for my harsh words, but the tension in our relationship is thick.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I've always had a pretty competitive relationship with my older sister, Sarah. She's three years older than me and has always excelled academically and socially. I’ve never been bad, but I've always felt like I was in her shadow. Recently, she graduated at the top of her class and got accepted into a prestigious university while I’m still figuring out my own plans for after high school.

To celebrate her achievements, our parents threw her a big graduation party. During the party, Sarah was naturally the center of attention, sharing stories and receiving all the praise. I’ve been feeling increasingly frustrated about being overlooked and also about how much pressure I feel to measure up to her. 

In a moment of weakness, I decided to make a joke during the party. I said something like, “Congrats, Sarah! Just remember, being the best in high school doesn’t guarantee you’ll be the best in life.” I thought it was a lighthearted jab, but it landed poorly. Everyone went silent, and Sarah looked hurt. She shot back, telling me I was being bitter and jealous, and that I should be happy for her instead of trying to tear her down.

Things escalated. I fired back, saying that she was insufferable and that she always needed to be the star of the show. Our parents stepped in, trying to mediate, but it turned into a full-blown argument. I ended up storming off, and Sarah cried and called me a terrible sister. 

After the party, my parents told me I should apologize, saying I ruined her big moment. I didn’t think I should apologize for my feelings, but I did feel bad for the way it all went down. I just wanted to stand up for myself, but I could have chosen my words better.

Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I have a close-knit group of friends, and we often host game nights at our house. One of our friends, let's call her Lisa, has been a part of our group for years. She's fun, lively, and adds a lot to the atmosphere, but she has a tendency to go overboard with drinking. Most of the time, it's harmless, but there have been a few occasions where her behavior has gotten out of hand—like the time she danced on our dining table and accidentally broke a vase, or when she made a scene over a card game and ended up crying in the corner.

We all care about Lisa and want her to have a good time, but the last few game nights have had a bit of a pattern. She drinks heavily, becomes overly emotional, and sometimes even gets confrontational over minor disagreements. It’s uncomfortable for everyone involved, and we’ve started to worry about her drinking habits. 

A couple of weeks ago, I decided to try something different. During our latest game night, I mixed her drinks to be mostly soda with just a splash of alcohol, thinking it would help keep her sober and reduce the likelihood of any drama. I thought this was a harmless way to ensure everyone had a good time without the usual chaos. It worked well initially; she was fun and engaged without any of the usual overreactions.

However, midway through the night, Lisa caught on when she noticed her drink didn't taste as strong as usual. She confronted me about it, clearly upset. I tried to explain that I was just looking out for her and that I wanted everyone to have a good time without any issues. Instead of calming her down, it escalated into an argument, and she accused me of being manipulative and undermining her choices.

In the end, the night turned sour, and we ended up with some hurt feelings. Now I feel guilty for not being upfront with her, but I also think I was trying to protect everyone from the fallout of her drinking.

I reached out to her to apologize, but instead of accepting my apology, she accused me of being inconsiderate and not caring about her feelings.

Everyone sucks here,"A few weeks ago, my friend group planned a game night at my place. I was excited and offered to host since my apartment has a decent amount of space and I have a gaming setup that everyone loves. When everyone arrived, I quickly realized I had underestimated the amount of food and drinks needed for the night. I had prepared snacks and drinks for a smaller group, and with the unexpected turnout, it wasn’t going to be enough.

Halfway through the night, I asked if anyone wanted to chip in for a pizza delivery. I figured it would be a fun way to feed everyone without having to run to the store myself. Most of my friends agreed, but one friend, Jake, rolled his eyes and said, ""You should have planned better if you were hosting."" I felt a bit embarrassed and defensive, but instead of letting it go, I shot back, “Well, maybe if you had offered to bring something, we wouldn’t be in this situation!”

Things escalated quickly, with Jake accusing me of being a poor host and not considering the group’s needs. The atmosphere in the room shifted, and soon everyone was throwing in their opinions. Some agreed with Jake, saying I should have prepared more, while others felt Jake was being overly harsh and that it wasn’t a big deal to order pizza.

In the heat of the moment, I snapped and said, “If you all think it’s such a big deal, you can just leave! I’ll eat the snacks myself!” That definitely didn’t help, and the tension grew. Eventually, we ended up ordering the pizza, but the mood was ruined, and we spent the rest of the night awkwardly avoiding each other’s gazes.

Last weekend, we had a small family gathering at my place to celebrate Mia’s new job. Jake and I had put a lot of effort into the food and drinks, and we wanted it to be a nice evening. Mia brought a couple of friends along, and they were all having a great time. Jake and I were feeling pretty good about the celebration.

As the night went on, the group started getting rowdy and eventually moved on to playing a drinking game. I thought it would be a fun way to unwind, so I joined in. Everything was going well until they decided to play a game called “Truth or Drink.” It’s basically where you answer a personal question or take a shot. 

At one point, someone asked, “What’s the biggest regret you have?” Mia, who had been drinking a bit too much, blurted out that she regretted moving away from home and getting into a terrible relationship that ended badly. This relationship was with someone who had been abusive, and it’s a touchy subject for her. I was supportive and echoed that it was a tough situation, but as I was trying to steer the conversation away from it, Jake jumped in and said something like, “Well, it sounds like you have a pattern of bad choices.”

That comment rubbed Mia the wrong way, and she immediately snapped back, calling him a jerk for saying something so insensitive. Tensions rose, and I tried to calm everyone down, but then Jake got defensive and started arguing with her, saying she shouldn’t be so sensitive and needed to take responsibility for her actions.

The argument escalated, and eventually, Mia stormed out of the house in tears, and I was left feeling torn between my boyfriend and my sister. I ended up arguing with Jake about how he could be so dismissive of Mia’s feelings, and he shot back that she needed to toughen up.

Everyone sucks here,"This happened last weekend. I want to give some context before I share the main story.

I’m a 25-year-old female living with two roommates, both of whom are also in their mid-twenties. We’ve been sharing this apartment for about a year now, and while we generally get along, there have been some serious communication issues lately. One of my roommates, Sarah, has been incredibly stressed with work, and the other, Mark, has been more irritable than usual, mainly because he’s been struggling with some personal issues.

On Saturday, around 3 PM, I was relaxing in the living room, catching up on my favorite show when I overheard Sarah and Mark start arguing in the kitchen. The volume kept escalating, and I could hear them throwing accusations back and forth. I tried to ignore it, but after about 20 minutes, I could feel my patience wearing thin. 

Finally, I decided I couldn’t take it anymore. I walked into the kitchen wearing my pajamas and holding a bowl of popcorn, ready to confront them. Instead of asking them to lower their voices or step outside to talk it out, I snapped and said something like, “Can you two keep it down? Some of us are trying to enjoy our Saturday without your drama!” 

This only fueled their argument further, as they turned their frustration toward me. Mark called me a bad roommate for not supporting them during a tough time, and Sarah accused me of being insensitive. The argument became a three-way shouting match, with hurtful comments flying around from all sides. I said things I didn’t mean in the heat of the moment, and I really didn’t expect it to escalate like that.

After about 30 minutes, we all stormed off to our separate rooms, leaving the atmosphere in the apartment incredibly tense. The next day, we talked it out and apologized, but there’s definitely still some lingering resentment between us.

I feel bad about how I handled the situation, but at the same time, I was overwhelmed and frustrated. I’m not sure if I was justified in my reaction or if I was just being a jerk.

My best friend, Jake, has been going through a rough patch lately. His girlfriend broke up with him about two months ago, and he’s been pretty down ever since. We’ve hung out a lot to help him cope, but he often brings up the breakup and how he misses her, which I get, but it’s starting to wear on me a bit.

At that point, I felt frustrated because I wanted the night to be fun and light-hearted, and he was bringing the mood down.

So, in a moment of frustration, I jokingly said, “Dude, can we talk about literally anything else? You’ve been moping about this for weeks!” I thought it would get a laugh, but instead, he got really quiet and left the party early. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but later he texted me saying that I was being insensitive and he was just trying to express his feelings.

Now I feel guilty because I didn’t mean to hurt him, but I also feel like he needs to find a better outlet for his feelings instead of constantly dwelling on his ex in social situations. A couple of our friends chimed in, saying that I was out of line, while others agreed that Jake needs to work on moving on.

So, am I the asshole for trying to lighten the mood, or is Jake being too sensitive about his breakup? I can see both sides, and I’m honestly confused.

A week before the trip, one of my friends, Jake, reached out to say he couldn’t make it because of a last-minute work commitment. I was disappointed but understood that sometimes work comes first. However, he asked if he could still come for just one day, and I told him he could join us on Saturday if he could make it.

He made comments about how we could have done things better and questioned why we didn’t wait for him to arrive before cooking dinner. This frustrated everyone, especially me, since I had put a lot of effort into planning everything.

After a while, I snapped and told him that if he wanted things done differently, he should have come earlier or helped plan instead of showing up uninvited and criticizing us. This upset him, and he stormed off to his tent. The rest of the group was awkward, and we ended up having to address the tension Jake had created.

The next morning, Jake was cold with everyone and didn’t participate in the group activities. I felt bad for snapping at him, but at the same time, I thought he was being unreasonable. By the time we packed up to leave, the atmosphere was tense, and I couldn’t help but feel he had ruined what could have been a great trip.

Now, I’m left wondering if I overstepped by confronting Jake. Did I handle the situation poorly or was he out of line? Am I the asshole for telling him off in front of everyone?",186,1853,0.76,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_24728,2023-12-07 00:00:00,ESH,2123,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, a few weeks ago, I hosted a small dinner party at my place for a few friends to catch up. I invited my three close friends: L, M, and J. Everyone was looking forward to it, and I spent the whole day preparing food and setting up the space.

On the day of the dinner, L showed up with her new boyfriend, who I hadn’t met before. I was a little surprised since I thought it was just going to be the four of us, but I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, so I welcomed him. The dinner was going well until the boyfriend started making inappropriate jokes about the food I had prepared, which made me really uncomfortable.

As the evening went on, his jokes escalated. He started mocking my cooking skills and even suggested I should have just ordered takeout instead. I felt embarrassed and hurt, especially since I had put so much effort into the dinner. I tried to laugh it off at first, but after a few comments, I couldn’t take it anymore. I snapped back, telling him that if he didn't like my cooking, he could just leave.

The atmosphere changed immediately, and L looked upset with me for how I reacted. M and J were awkwardly silent, and I could tell they were uncomfortable too. L's boyfriend got defensive and started arguing with me, saying I was being overly sensitive. It turned into a bit of a heated exchange, which resulted in L and her boyfriend leaving early. 

After they left, M and J expressed that they thought I went too far but also mentioned that the boyfriend's behavior was out of line. I felt bad for ruining the evening but also felt justified in standing up for myself.

During the game, my friend Jake made a comment about my cooking skills, joking that the last dish I brought to a potluck was ""a disaster.""

In the moment, I felt defensive and snapped back, saying something like, ""Well, at least I can cook better than you can play basketball.""

So, I have this group of friends that I’ve been hanging out with for years, and we have a pretty relaxed and playful dynamic. We often joke around, and we all know each other well enough to dish out some light-hearted ribbing. 

Recently, we invited a new friend, Alex, to join our regular game night. Alex is a nice person but tends to take things a bit too seriously and can get defensive easily. During one of the games, we were playing a card game that allows for a lot of banter and joking. At one point, Alex made a move that we all thought was pretty silly, and one of my friends jokingly said, “Wow, Alex, that was a real genius move. Are you trying to lose on purpose?”

Everyone laughed, including Alex at first, but then Alex suddenly got quiet. After a brief pause, Alex snapped back with, “Not everyone can be great at this game like you, maybe you should keep your comments to yourself.” 

I thought they were overreacting, so I jumped in and said something like, “Come on, it’s all in good fun! We’re not here to win Oscars, we’re just playing a game. If you can’t take a joke, maybe you shouldn’t be playing with us.”

The mood shifted, and Alex looked visibly upset. A couple of my friends agreed with me, saying it was just a joke, but others felt like I was being unnecessarily harsh. Alex ended up leaving early, and since then, things have been awkward when we talk about game nights.

Everyone sucks here,"So my friend group decided to host a game night every month, and everyone was really excited about it. We usually play board games and video games, and it’s a great way for us to unwind and catch up. I’ve been a part of this group for years, and I always try to bring new games for us to try out.

Last month, my friend Lily suggested we try a new party game she discovered. I was skeptical because I had heard it could be a bit intense and lead to arguments, but I went along with it. During the game, things started off lighthearted, but as we played, tensions began to rise. I noticed that Lily was getting more and more aggressive with her gameplay, and it seemed like she was targeting me specifically. 

I got frustrated and tried to defend myself, but it turned into a back-and-forth that escalated quickly. I ended up saying, “You’re taking this way too seriously; it’s just a game!” which only made her more upset. She fired back, saying I was just a sore loser and that I needed to lighten up.

Feeling attacked, I snapped and said, “At least I’m not a bully trying to ruin everyone’s fun!” This clearly hurt her feelings, and she shut down completely for the rest of the night. The atmosphere became really tense, and our other friends tried to mediate, but it felt like the damage was done.

After the game night, I apologized to Lily for my harsh words, but I also expressed how I felt she was being overly aggressive. She insisted I was being too sensitive and that I needed to toughen up. Our friends were divided; some sided with me, saying that Lily was out of line, while others thought I was making a mountain out of a molehill.

Everyone sucks here,"Hello, I (29F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (30M) for about three years. When we first started dating, I was very open about my past experiences, including some toxic relationships and a few friendships that didn’t end well. My boyfriend was great at listening, and I thought we had a strong foundation built on trust and honesty.

A few months ago, I started hanging out with an old friend from high school (29M), who I had lost touch with over the years. He reached out to me, and we quickly fell back into a comfortable friendship. I didn’t think much of it at first and mentioned it to my boyfriend, but I could tell he felt a bit uneasy about it. I assured him that it was just a friendship and that there was nothing to worry about.

As time went on, I began to notice that my old friend was a little too flirty for my comfort, but I brushed it off as harmless banter. I didn't want to seem paranoid, so I didn’t mention it to my boyfriend. A few weeks later, my boyfriend expressed his concerns about my friendship with this guy. He was uncomfortable with how much time I was spending with him and the way he interacted with me. I got defensive, insisting that he was just an old friend and that my boyfriend was being unreasonable.

One night, after a few drinks, I ended up hanging out with my old friend and a few others, and we all ended up at someone’s place. Things got a bit out of hand, and I kissed my friend. I was immediately filled with guilt and regret. I knew I had messed up, and I didn’t want to hurt my boyfriend, so I decided to keep it to myself. 

However, a few weeks later, my boyfriend found out through another friend who was there that night. He was devastated and felt completely betrayed. When he confronted me, I tried to explain that it was a mistake and that I still loved him. In the heat of the moment, I blamed him for being too controlling and stifling my friendships, which only made things worse.

Now we’re both hurt and angry. He feels like I disrespected our relationship, and I feel like I should have been able to have a friendship without feeling judged. I know I messed up by not being honest about the kiss, and he acknowledges that he could have been more trusting. 

So, am I the asshole for hiding the kiss and not respecting my boyfriend’s feelings about my friendship? Or is he the asshole for not trusting me and making me feel guilty about my friendships?",217,1495,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_47307,2019-03-18 00:00:00,ESH,2430,AITA

We both have demanding jobs, and we’ve been feeling the stress of work-life balance. I work in marketing, and my partner is a software engineer. 

A couple of months ago, I started feeling overwhelmed with work and personal commitments. I noticed that my partner, who usually helps out with chores and cooking, had become less engaged at home. I brought this up during a conversation one evening, and my partner got defensive, saying they were also feeling the pressure at work and didn’t have the energy to do more around the house.

After that, I tried to be more understanding, but over the next few weeks, I started to feel resentful. I felt like I was carrying the weight of our household chores while my partner was just focused on work and unwinding at home. I started venting to my close friends about how I felt, and they encouraged me to stand up for myself.

One evening, after a particularly long week, I snapped. I lashed out at my partner, saying they were being lazy and not pulling their weight. I told them I was tired of being the only one who cared about keeping our home running. My partner was understandably hurt and responded by saying I was being overly dramatic and should cut them some slack.

Things escalated from there. We started arguing regularly, and I continued to vent to my friends, telling them about our conflicts. My partner overheard me talking to one of my friends about our disagreements, and they were upset that I was airing our private issues. They said I was making them look bad and that I should have kept things between us instead of discussing it outside.

I understand their point, but I felt like I needed support from my friends because I was feeling overwhelmed. I also realize I shouldn’t have attacked my partner the way I did. We both made mistakes; I shouldn’t have vented so much and made my partner feel like they were the sole problem, and my partner shouldn’t have shut down when I was trying to communicate my feelings.

Now we’re in a bit of a stalemate. My partner is still annoyed that I shared our issues, and I feel like I can’t talk to them about how I’m feeling without them getting defensive.

I’m a pretty active person, enjoying hiking, cycling, and going to the gym regularly, while my partner prefers to stay home, binge-watch shows, and play video games. 

Recently, I decided to plan a weekend hiking trip with some friends. I invited my partner to join us, thinking it would be a fun getaway, but he flat-out refused, saying he didn’t want to do anything physical and preferred to relax at home. I was a bit disappointed but respected his decision, figuring he could enjoy his weekend however he wanted.

When I returned from the trip, I was excited to share my experiences, but instead, my partner seemed distant. I soon found out that he had spent the entire weekend playing video games and watching TV, while I was out enjoying nature and having fun. I felt a pang of guilt for having fun while he was at home, but I also felt frustrated that he didn’t even try to join me for part of it. 

This led to an argument where I expressed my feelings, saying that I wished he would make more of an effort to join in on activities that I enjoy. He shot back, saying that I was being selfish for not considering that he just has different interests and that I should stop trying to change him. I told him I felt bored and unfulfilled when we only did things he liked, and he accused me of being controlling.

Both of us ended up saying hurtful things, and by the end of the night, we were both upset and hurt.

I need some perspective on a situation that has me and my brother at odds. 

A few weeks ago, my brother and his girlfriend got a cat from a shelter. They were thrilled about it, and I was happy for them. However, shortly after getting the cat, they started having issues with it. The cat was very skittish and would hide whenever they had guests over. This frustrated my brother, as he wanted the cat to be sociable and friendly.

One night, they invited me over for dinner. I noticed the cat was particularly anxious and kept darting around the house. My brother was visibly upset and started venting about how the cat was ruining their lives because it wouldn't behave like a normal cat. He mentioned that he was considering returning the cat to the shelter because it just wasn’t working out.

I tried to empathize with him, but I also pointed out that it can take time for shelter cats to adjust to a new environment. I suggested that they should give the cat more time and maybe even look into some training resources for anxious cats. My brother didn’t take my advice well and accused me of being too soft on the cat. We ended up having a pretty heated argument, where I told him that giving up on the cat so quickly was irresponsible.

After that, things got worse. His girlfriend got involved, and she felt that I was attacking them for wanting to return the cat. I didn’t mean to come off that way, but I felt strongly that they should at least try to work with the cat rather than just giving up. 

In the end, they decided to keep the cat, but only after a lot of back and forth, and I feel like I may have damaged my relationship with both of them over this. I still think they should have given it a fair shot, but I realize I may have come off as judgmental and harsh.

It’s a small dog, and I thought it wouldn’t be too difficult to keep things under wraps, especially since I live on the top floor and only a few neighbors ever see her.

One of my neighbors, an older woman, has a tendency to complain about noises and disturbances.

I understand that she has her preferences, but it’s also just a part of living in a community. I tried to keep my dog quiet, but sometimes she barks, especially when she hears other dogs outside or if someone knocks on the door.

Last week, my neighbor knocked on my door and confronted me about the barking. She told me I should get rid of the dog because she was ruining her peace and that I was being selfish for keeping her in a pet-free building. I got defensive and told her that it's not my fault she doesn’t like dogs and that she should just deal with it. I also mentioned that she should find a place with no pets if she was that bothered. 

In the heat of the moment, I didn’t realize how harsh I sounded. She went on to say that she’s lived in the building for over 20 years and that I should respect the rules. I told her that she didn’t own the building, and I wasn’t breaking the law, just the policy. I admit I could have been more considerate about her feelings, but at the same time, I felt she was being overly dramatic about a little barking.

Everyone sucks here,"So, a few weeks ago, my friends and I organized a game night at my place. We had been planning it for a while, and I was really looking forward to it. I spent the whole day cleaning the house and setting up snacks and drinks. When everyone arrived, we were all excited, but things quickly took a turn.

One of my friends, Jake, brought his own board game that he was really eager to play. However, I had planned to start the night with a different game that I thought everyone would enjoy. When I suggested we play my game first, Jake responded pretty dismissively, saying, “That’s boring, let’s play mine.” I tried to explain why I thought my game would be a better opener, but he just kept insisting.

At this point, I was feeling frustrated because I had put a lot of effort into hosting. I snapped and said, “If you want to play your game, then maybe you should host next time.” That made Jake visibly upset, and he shot back, saying I was being selfish and ruining the fun for everyone. The atmosphere got really tense, and the rest of our friends were caught in the middle, trying to diffuse the situation.

In the heat of the moment, I told Jake that if he didn’t want to play my game, he could just leave. That was pretty harsh, and I regretted it right after saying it. Eventually, we decided to play both games, but the vibe was definitely off for the rest of the night.

I feel like I overreacted, but Jake also could have been more respectful about my plans. AITA?",916,2240,0.91,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_82524,2019-09-25 00:00:00,ESH,1476,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My girlfriend and I have been living together for about a year now. Things were going well until my sister, who recently lost her job, came to stay with us temporarily while she figures things out. I care about my sister and wanted to help her, but having her in our small apartment has definitely caused some strain.

Here’s the setup:

We have a one-bedroom apartment. My girlfriend and I share the bedroom, while my sister sleeps on the couch in the living room. Space is tight, and privacy is nearly nonexistent. My girlfriend and I have had some arguments about how to handle the situation. I’ve been trying to be accommodating, but it’s frustrating for both of us.

Now, here’s where I feel I messed up. One night, my girlfriend and I had planned a cozy night in, just the two of us. We were looking forward to some quality time together. However, when we got home from work, we found my sister had invited a couple of friends over for a small get-together without asking us first. The living room was crowded with people, music, and laughter.

I felt disrespected and annoyed. I had already been feeling like I didn’t have enough privacy, and this just pushed me over the edge. I snapped and told my sister that it was unacceptable to have friends over without checking with us first and that she needed to be more considerate of our space. I admit I raised my voice and came off harsh, which led to an argument where she accused me of being ungrateful for the help.

After that, my girlfriend and I had a fight about how I handled the situation. She felt that I could have been more patient and that it’s a tough time for my sister. I also felt my girlfriend wasn’t considering my frustrations enough, which led to me being a bit short with her.

Now I’m left wondering if I was the asshole for losing my cool with my sister or if my girlfriend was right to call me out for being too harsh. It feels like everyone is on edge, and I hate that this situation has caused tension between us all. So, am I the asshole here?",239,1099,0.82,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_63230,2021-05-23 00:00:00,ESH,2026,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, I (28F) have a friend, let's call her Sarah (27F), who has been really into this new diet trend that’s all about detoxing and eliminating certain food groups. I’m all for healthy eating, but Sarah has taken it to an extreme level and has been very vocal about it lately.

The other day, we were at a mutual friend’s birthday party. Sarah spent the majority of the time critiquing everyone’s food choices and insisting that they were “toxic” and would ruin their health. I found it a bit much, but I tried to brush it off. However, when she got to the cake, I couldn't help myself. I jokingly said, “Well, at least it’s not made with actual poison.” It was meant to lighten the mood, but she shot back with, “At least I care about my health. Some of us don’t want to be sick!”

I snapped and responded, “You know, not everyone can afford to be as rigid about their diet as you are. Some of us just enjoy food.” The conversation escalated, and we ended up having a pretty heated argument at the party. It got so intense that a few people stepped in to separate us. 

Afterward, I felt bad for ruining the party atmosphere, and I realized that I may have overreacted. But honestly, I was just tired of her judgment about what everyone was eating. I reached out to her the next day to apologize for my comments, but I still felt she was being rude about the whole food thing.

Now I’m wondering if I was the asshole for blowing up at her or if she was too extreme with her comments about everyone’s diet.

Everyone sucks here,"Hello. I live with my partner, Sam, and we have been together for three years. Recently, we decided to host a small dinner party for some friends. I love cooking and wanted to impress everyone with a fancy meal, so I spent all day preparing.

Here's where things went sideways. Sam's best friend, Alex, arrived early and started helping himself to the snacks I had laid out. I didn't think much of it at first, but when I went to check on the main dish I was cooking, I found Alex in the kitchen going through the ingredients I had set aside for my special sauce, and he was mixing them up in a bowl. I asked him what he was doing, and he said he wanted to help. I politely told him that I had everything under control and to please leave the cooking to me.

But then Alex shrugged and kept mixing, saying it would be better with his “expert touch.” I got really frustrated and told him to stop, that he was ruining my dish. He laughed it off and said I was being dramatic, but I could feel my blood boiling. I ended up taking the bowl from him and putting it in the fridge, saying he could just stick to the snacks.

When our guests arrived, I was already on edge. I tried to focus on serving dinner, but it was hard with Alex making snarky comments about my cooking. I snapped at him during the meal, telling him that if he didn’t like how I cooked, he could leave. The atmosphere became tense, and our friends seemed uncomfortable.

After dinner, Sam was upset with me, saying I overreacted and embarrassed him in front of our friends. I felt justified because Alex was being really intrusive, but I also realized I might have taken it too far. Now, I’m wondering if I was wrong to lash out or if Alex was being a jerk for not respecting my space in the kitchen.

Everyone sucks here,"First off, I want to clarify that I’m not perfect, and I recognize that I have my flaws. I recently had a situation with my best friend, who I’ve known for over a decade. We’ve always been there for each other through thick and thin, but things took a turn recently.

About a month ago, I decided to throw a surprise birthday party for my friend. I reached out to a few mutual friends to help plan it, and we all agreed to keep it a secret. However, I didn’t realize that my friend had planned a small get-together with just a few close friends on the same day. When my friend found out about the surprise party, they were upset that I didn’t consult them first.

I understand that my intentions were good, but I was genuinely excited to celebrate my friend and didn’t think it would be an issue. After they expressed their disappointment, things got a bit heated. I ended up saying that they were being ungrateful and that I just wanted to do something nice for them. My friend retorted that I should have respected their plans and communicated better.

In the heat of the moment, I said some things I didn’t mean, and my friend threw back that I was inconsiderate and selfish. We both ended up saying hurtful things, and now there’s this tension between us. I feel bad about how things escalated and I regret that it turned into a confrontation.

So, I guess I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for wanting to celebrate my friend’s birthday in a way I thought they would enjoy, or if they were in the wrong for being upset about it. Am I the asshole here?",266,2445,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_45725,2018-08-15 00:00:00,ESH,1554,AITA

She’s a single mom with two kids, and it’s clear she’s struggling financially. I often see her using food stamps and trying to stretch her budget as far as it can go. 

One day, while I was helping her at the self-checkout, she mentioned that she was running low on groceries and was really stressed about how to feed her kids. I felt a pang of sympathy, and on a whim, I offered to give her some of the leftover groceries from the store that were about to be thrown out. She was so grateful, and I felt like I had done a good deed.

A week later, she came back and approached me again, saying it really helped her, and could I do it again? I agreed, thinking I was just helping someone in need. But then I started feeling pressured. Despite loving to help people, I realized I was putting my job at risk by giving away store property.

Eventually, I decided to stop. The next time she asked, I told her I couldn’t help anymore because it was against store policy. She seemed really upset and accused me of turning my back on her when she needed help the most. I felt guilty but also frustrated because I was just trying to do the right thing while also keeping my job.

Instead of pulling her aside or addressing it calmly, I decided to make a joke to lighten the mood and redirect her. I said something like, ""Wow Sarah, I think you might be auditioning for the role of the party clown!""

A few weeks ago, my friends and I decided to have a movie night at my place. We were all excited, and I went out of my way to prepare a bunch of snacks, like popcorn, nachos, and even some homemade cookies. I had everything set up, and I felt pretty proud of the spread.

When my friends arrived, one of them, Jake, brought his girlfriend, whom I hadn’t met yet. She seemed nice enough at first, but as the night went on, I noticed she was piling the snacks onto her plate like there was no tomorrow. At first, I laughed it off, thinking she was just really into the food. But then she started taking snacks from everyone else's plates too, like she just didn’t care about sharing.

After a while, I felt uncomfortable watching her munch away without even acknowledging the effort I put into making everything. I made a bit of a joke, asking if she was planning to eat all my snacks by herself. I thought it would lighten the mood, but she just looked at me with a blank stare. Feeling awkward, I tried to change the subject, but Jake chimed in, saying I should just let her enjoy herself. 

I got defensive and pointed out that we were all supposed to share the food, and it didn’t seem fair for her to just take everything.

Recently, they invited me to a gathering where they said they would be bringing their current partners, which is usually a mix of people I don’t know very well.

I decided to attend, thinking I could be supportive. However, as soon as I arrived, it became clear that the atmosphere was very different from what I expected. Their partners were very affectionate, and it felt like I was intruding on something very intimate. It made me uncomfortable, and I ended up not engaging much with anyone.

I’m in a bit of a bind with my friend group and could use some outside perspectives. I hope this doesn’t come off as too dramatic but I’m genuinely confused. 

We’ve been friends for about five years, and we pride ourselves on being supportive of each other. Lately, however, things have been rocky. One of my friends, Sarah, has been going through a tough time after getting laid off from her job. I’ve been trying to help her out, and I genuinely care about her well-being.

A few weeks ago, we were at a gathering, and I made a light-hearted comment about how she should consider exploring a different career path, maybe something more creative, like art or writing, given her talents. I thought it would encourage her, but she got really upset and said I was being dismissive of her situation. I didn't mean to hurt her feelings, and I thought I was being supportive, so I tried to explain myself, but it turned into a bigger argument. 

Later that night, another friend, Mark, chimed in and, in an attempt to ease the tension, made a joke about how we should all just quit our jobs and start a band. I thought it was funny and joined in, but Sarah didn’t find it amusing at all. She snapped at Mark, and the whole group ended up feeling awkward.

After that, a couple of days later, I reached out to Sarah to apologize for my comment. She accepted my apology but said she felt like I was trying to undermine her struggle. I felt like I had to defend myself and mentioned that I was genuinely trying to help her. Sarah then accused me of being selfish and not considering her feelings, and I got defensive about my intentions.

Now, it feels like there's a rift in our friend group. Mark and I both think Sarah is being overly sensitive, but I also recognize that she’s going through a lot. I don’t want to lose my friendship with her, but I also think she should be able to take a joke or two. 

So, AITA for trying to encourage my friend who is struggling, or are we all just being assholes in this situation? I’d appreciate any insights.

Edit: After reflecting, I realize that I might have been too insensitive with my comments, and it’s important to be more mindful of what she’s going through. Mark also acknowledged that his joke probably wasn’t the right time, either. We both feel bad about how it all escalated and want to mend things, but we’re not sure how.

Recently, I noticed that my favorite sweater was missing. I asked Sarah if she had seen it, and she casually admitted that she had borrowed it a few weeks ago and had ""forgotten"" to return it.

She got defensive and said I was being stingy and that I should just let her borrow things if I cared about her.

Fast forward to the night of the game, and we ordered two large pizzas. Everyone arrived, and after a couple of hours of playing and eating, I noticed that the salad my girlfriend had made was barely touched. I jokingly asked, “Did anyone even want salad? Should we just toss it?” My girlfriend got annoyed and said it was rude to make jokes about food, especially something she had put effort into.

Feeling defensive, I snapped back saying that I thought it was a waste of effort to make something no one was eating. The atmosphere got a little tense for a moment, but we moved on. Later in the night, my friend Mike, who had been quiet, decided to take a few slices of pizza. When he reached for a third slice, I jokingly said, “Easy there, Mike, save some for the rest of us!” 

Mike shot back with, “Well, maybe if you weren’t so focused on that salad, we’d have more pizza to go around!” I felt that was a bit harsh and responded, “At least I’m not the one stuffing my face while everyone else is trying to enjoy a good time.” 

Things escalated from there, with Mike and I going back and forth, and my girlfriend trying to mediate. By the end of the night, the vibe was definitely off, and a few of our friends said they felt uncomfortable because of the tension between Mike and me.

Everyone sucks here,"Last weekend, I was at a local park to enjoy some fresh air and do a bit of reading. It was a beautiful day, and I settled down on a bench with my book and some snacks. I was really looking forward to the peaceful afternoon.

While I was engrossed in my book, a group of kids started playing nearby. They were laughing and having a great time, which was fine with me; I was happy to hear them enjoy themselves. However, after a while, one of the kids, a boy maybe around 10 years old, came over and asked if he could borrow my phone to play a game. 

I politely declined, explaining that I didn't want to lend it out to someone I didn't know. He seemed a little disappointed but wandered back to his friends. A few minutes later, his mother approached me. She was clearly annoyed and asked why I wouldn’t let her son use my phone. I explained my reasons, but she kept pushing, saying he just wanted to play a game for a little while and that I should be more understanding.

At that point, I felt a bit cornered. I snapped back, saying that it was my property and I could choose not to lend it out if I didn't feel comfortable. The mother rolled her eyes and walked away, muttering something under her breath.

Later on, I noticed the same kid sitting quietly away from the group, looking sad. Feeling a bit guilty, I decided to offer him a pack of snacks I had brought with me as a peace offering. He accepted it with a shy smile, but his expression was still a bit downcast.

When I left the park, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had been too harsh in my response to the mother. I also felt sorry for the kid, who just wanted some fun. I regretted not finding a middle ground.

So, AITA for standing my ground about my phone, or did I overreact and not consider the kid's feelings?",952,1489,0.53,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_29997,2021-05-27 00:00:00,ESH,1787,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Recently, I've been going through a rough patch with my friend Sarah and my boyfriend Jake. Sarah and Jake used to be good friends before Jake and I started dating, and while I was never uncomfortable with their friendship, lately I've noticed that they’ve been texting a lot more. 

One day, while I was at work, I accidentally saw a message from Sarah on Jake's phone. It was something flirty, and I felt my stomach drop. I confronted Jake about it when I got home, and he brushed it off, saying they were just joking and that I was overreacting. I tried to let it go, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something more going on.

Later that week, I confronted Sarah during a dinner we were all having. I asked her point-blank if there was anything going on between her and Jake. She laughed and said of course not, but I could tell she was a bit defensive. In a moment of frustration, I told her that she should back off and respect our relationship. I could see her face drop, and maybe I was too harsh, but I felt like I was protecting myself.

Afterward, Jake was furious with me. He felt I had accused him of cheating and disrespected Sarah in front of everyone. He said I should trust him and that I was being paranoid. Instead of backing down, I doubled down and told him that if he couldn’t understand where I was coming from, maybe he wasn’t the right person for me. 

Things escalated, and we ended up having a huge argument. Jake ended up storming out, and I felt terrible for what I said. The next day, I reached out to Sarah to apologize for my outburst, but she didn’t want to talk and said I needed to sort things out with Jake first. 

Now, I feel caught in the middle. I don’t think I handled the situation well, and maybe I let my insecurities take over. Jake shouldn’t have been texting her in that way, but I also shouldn’t have accused them both of something without having solid proof.

Everyone sucks here,"Throwaway

I have a daughter who is 10 and a son who is 13. Recently, my daughter has been struggling with anxiety, particularly around bedtime. To help her feel more secure, I decided to allow her to sleep with a nightlight and keep her stuffed animals close by. However, my son thinks this is silly and has been teasing her about it, calling her ""baby"" and making fun of her fears.

One evening, I overheard my son mocking her in the other room. Instead of addressing the situation immediately, I confronted him after dinner. I told him that he needed to be more compassionate and that it wasn't right to make fun of his sister. He responded by saying he was just joking and that she needed to toughen up.

Feeling frustrated, I grounded him for a week without his phone or video games, hoping it would teach him a lesson. He reacted by becoming even more resentful and started refusing to help around the house, which added more stress to my daughter because she felt responsible for his bad mood.

My daughter, meanwhile, started to withdraw even more and has become upset about her brother's behavior. I tried to have a family discussion about kindness and understanding, but it turned into an argument. They both ended up yelling at each other, and I felt like I was failing in my role as a parent.

Now I’m feeling guilty for grounding my son, thinking maybe I should have handled it differently or just let them sort it out. But I also want to protect my daughter from bullying.

Everyone sucks here,"My sister and I have always had a rocky relationship, especially since we both have very different lifestyles. I’m more laid-back and enjoy spending time at home, while she’s always out with friends and trying to be the life of the party. We’ve clashed over the years, but we usually keep things civil for family gatherings.

Last weekend, we attended a family barbecue at our parents’ house. It was a fun day, filled with food and laughter. At one point, I took a group photo of everyone enjoying the day and posted it on my Instagram. It was a nice shot, and I thought it captured the essence of our family.

A few hours later, my sister texted me, furious. She demanded that I take down the photo because she was worried about her image. Apparently, she had been trying to present a particular persona to her friends and didn’t want them to see her in a “family” context. I found this pretty absurd, considering it was just a harmless family photo with everyone smiling.

I tried to explain my perspective, telling her that she shouldn’t be so concerned about what others think and that it’s just a family gathering. But she wouldn’t hear it. We ended up getting into a heated argument over text, with her calling me selfish for not considering her feelings and me calling her dramatic and overly sensitive.

Eventually, I took the photo down, but not before making a sarcastic comment about how she’s not a celebrity and should chill out. In the end, we both ended up feeling upset. I think I overreacted with the sarcasm, and she was way too preoccupied with her image, so I guess we’re both at fault here.",748,2448,0.97,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_41840,2018-05-20 00:00:00,ESH,1611,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, I (24F) have a close-knit group of friends that includes my best friend, Sarah (23F), and her boyfriend, Mike (25M). We've all known each other for years, and while Sarah and Mike have been dating for about two years, I've always tried to maintain a respectful distance regarding their relationship.

Recently, I started getting into hiking, and Mike is an avid hiker. He offered to show me some local trails since he knows I’m new to the hobby. Sarah seemed okay with it at first, but I noticed she started acting a little jealous. I tried to keep things friendly and light, making sure to always invite her along. However, she declined every time, saying she wasn't interested in hiking.

Last weekend, Mike and I went hiking together, and we had a blast. I posted a few pictures on my Instagram, and I tagged him as a way to share the great experience. Sarah saw the post and flipped out. She started texting me, accusing me of trying to steal her boyfriend and being inappropriate by going alone with him. I was taken aback and tried to explain that it was just a hiking trip and nothing more. 

Feeling defensive, I shot back that she was being unreasonable and overly possessive. I told her that she could have come along if she wanted to, and that it wasn’t my fault she didn’t want to participate. This led to a heated exchange where we both ended up saying hurtful things. I called her insecure, and she called me a homewrecker. It got pretty nasty.

Mike eventually stepped in and tried to mediate, but honestly, it felt awkward. I didn’t mean to cause a rift between them, but I was frustrated with how Sarah was treating me. Now, there’s this tension in the group, and I feel like I’m partially to blame alongside Sarah. I didn’t intend for things to escalate, but I also feel like I was just trying to make a new friend in Mike.

Everyone sucks here,"I’m a junior in college, and I live with a roommate who has some pretty different habits than I do. We’ve been friends for a while, but living together has definitely brought some tension. I’m debating whether I’ve been fair or if I’m being unreasonable, so I’m turning to you all for judgment. 

Here are the main issues we’ve had:

1. My roommate plays music and podcasts out loud while getting ready in the morning. I have early classes, and I usually try to sleep in a little longer, but she tends to blast her music at 7 AM. My side: I need my sleep, and it feels disrespectful to be so loud in the morning. Her side: she’s just trying to get ready for her day and shouldn't have to tiptoe around me.

2. She has a habit of leaving her shoes and bags all over the common area. I’ve tripped over her stuff a few times, and it drives me crazy. I’ve mentioned it to her a couple of times, but it hasn’t changed. My side: I think it’s inconsiderate to make our space cluttered. Her side: she says she’s just busy and doesn’t have time to organize everything all the time.

3. When we eat together, she often leaves her dirty dishes in the sink for days. I don’t mind doing the dishes sometimes, but it feels unfair when I’m constantly cleaning up after her. My side: if we share the kitchen, we should share the responsibility. Her side: she claims she’s been too swamped with schoolwork to keep up with chores.

4. Lastly, when I asked her to keep the noise down while I was studying late one night, she got really defensive and claimed I was being uptight. I’ll admit I might have been a bit snappy, but I was really stressed about an upcoming exam. My side: I need quiet to focus, especially during finals. Her side: she says she deserves to unwind after a long day, too.

So, yeah, I’m feeling pretty torn about all of this. Am I being unreasonable, or are we both just not handling this well? ESH?",858,1444,0.87,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_58637,2019-07-10 00:00:00,ESH,1903,AITA

I felt betrayed and decided to throw a party anyway, inviting all our family and friends, and I made sure to plan it for the same weekend as her small gathering. 

When she found out, she was furious. She accused me of trying to overshadow her moment and being inconsiderate of her wishes. I argued that she was the one who didn’t want to celebrate with the family and that I was just trying to show my support in my own way. 

Things escalated, and we ended up having a huge argument over the phone. I told her that if she didn’t want to include me in her celebrations, then I was going to do my own thing.

I have a cousin, Jake, who is 10 years old and known in our family for being a bit of a troublemaker. He has broken a few things at past gatherings and is generally rowdy, which makes things difficult for everyone.

As the party approached, I expressed my concerns to my family about having Jake over. I mentioned that I might not be comfortable with him attending because I didn't want to deal with the chaos that usually follows him. My sister, Jake's mom, got really upset and accused me of trying to exclude him just because I didn’t want to deal with his behavior.

I ended up telling my sister that I thought it would be best if Jake didn’t come, but she argued that it wasn't fair to him since he was excited about the party. I felt bad because I know that I’m being harsh, but I also didn't want to risk him breaking something expensive or disturbing the party with his antics. 

Ultimately, I decided to compromise and allow Jake to come, but I made it clear to my sister that if he caused any trouble, I would ask him to leave. During the party, he ended up knocking over a drink all over the living room rug, which I had just bought. I confronted him about it, telling him to be more careful, and I might have been a bit harsh in my tone. My sister got defensive again, saying I was overreacting and that kids will be kids.

Everyone sucks here,"I'm posting this because I really need some perspective on my situation. Just a heads up, I'm on mobile, so please forgive any typos. TLDR at the end.

I (28F) have a younger brother, Jake (24M), who moved back in with our parents a few months ago after a rough breakup. While I sympathize with him, it’s been a bit draining. He tends to wallow in self-pity and complains about everything, from his job to his lack of friends. I try to be supportive, but I also have my own life to manage, including a demanding job and my own mental health issues.

Recently, I had a really rough week at work and was looking forward to a quiet weekend to recharge. On Friday night, I decided to cancel my plans with friends to just relax at home. However, Jake came into my room unannounced and started complaining about how boring it was at home. He insisted that I should take him out to a bar or something, claiming I was being antisocial for not wanting to go out. I told him I really needed some time to myself and that I didn’t feel like going out.

He got upset and accused me of being selfish and not caring about him. I snapped back, and we ended up arguing, with me saying he needed to find better ways to cope instead of dragging me down with his negativity. Our argument escalated, and I ended up telling him that he couldn’t just expect me to be his entertainment and that he needed to grow up.

The next day, I went out with my friends anyway, but I felt guilty about the fight. I talked to my mom about it, hoping she’d understand my side, but she told me I should have been more patient and that Jake needed me. She said that I should’ve made more of an effort to include him in my life instead of shutting him out.

Now I feel kind of conflicted. I completely understand that Jake is going through a tough time, but I also think he should be responsible for his own happiness and not rely on me. I feel bad for how I reacted during our fight but I also think I had a right to want my own space.

TLDR: I had a rough week and wanted some alone time, but my brother wanted me to take him out and I ended up snapping at him during an argument. Now I feel guilty about it, but I also think he shouldn’t depend on me for his happiness. Am I the asshole?",330,1895,0.61,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_58519,2021-09-19 00:00:00,ESH,2250,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, I (25F) recently started sharing a small apartment with my friend, Alex (26M). We've known each other for a while, and I thought living together would be fun. For context, I’m pretty tidy and organized, while Alex is more laid-back and a bit messy. We agreed on a few house rules, like cleaning up after ourselves and not having friends over without asking the other person first.

Initially, things were going okay, but then Alex started inviting his friends over more often than we discussed. I didn't mind at first, but it began to feel like I was living in a constant party atmosphere. My work schedule is pretty demanding, and I need to focus when I'm home. I’d come home from a long day, and there would be empty pizza boxes and beer cans scattered around. I’d ask Alex to clean up, but he’d just brush it off or say he’d do it later. 

One night, I had a particularly rough day and came home to find his friends sprawled across the living room, loud music playing, and my kitchen in complete disarray. I lost my temper and yelled at Alex about how disrespectful it was to have people over without checking with me. I told him I felt like I didn't even live there anymore. It was a pretty heated argument, and I ended up saying some things I regret, like how I was tired of living with a child.

After our fight, things became really awkward. Alex apologized, but I continued to feel annoyed about the mess and his friends intruding on my space. To get back at him, I started leaving little messes around the apartment, like not washing my dishes or leaving clothes lying around. It was petty, and I knew it, but I felt like he needed to understand how it felt to live with someone who doesn’t clean up after themselves.

I thought it was fun and supportive, but Jake snapped one day, telling me that I was being annoying and to just let him live his life without my constant input.

That hurt, and I responded defensively, saying I was just trying to be a good brother and that he should appreciate my support. I mentioned how I started to feel like he didn’t want me in his life anymore, which I guess was unfair because he was just trying to express how I made him feel. 

Things escalated on the day of the event. I showed up with a rainbow flag to surprise him and cheer him on. Instead of being happy, Jake looked mortified. He pulled me aside and told me that he didn’t want any attention drawn to him like that. I was taken aback and argued that I was just trying to show my support.

Recently, I got engaged and I was super excited to plan my wedding. I wanted it to be a special day with my closest friends and family.

When I started planning, I decided to have Sarah as my maid of honor because she means a lot to me. However, I quickly realized that Sarah has a tendency to be very controlling and opinionated, which I had brushed off in the past but now became more pronounced during the wedding planning process. She started making decisions without consulting me, like picking out potential venues and guest lists, and even suggested colors and themes that I didn’t really like.

I tried to communicate with her about my vision for the wedding. I expressed that I wanted it to be a reflection of both me and my fiancé, and I needed her support in that. Instead of understanding, she got defensive and accused me of trying to take away her “role” as maid of honor. I was frustrated, and during one heated conversation, I snapped and told her that I was the one getting married, not her, and she needed to step back.

I reached out to apologize for my tone, but she brushed it off, saying I was being selfish and inconsiderate. In my anger, I told her that if she couldn't support me in my wedding planning, then I would reconsider her role in the wedding altogether, which upset her even more.

Now, I feel guilty because I didn't handle the situation as well as I could have. I also feel like I've lost a bit of my relationship with her over what should have been a joyous time. I’m left wondering if I was too harsh or if I was justified in wanting to stand up for myself. 

Am I the asshole for how I handled the situation with my cousin? 

TLDR; My cousin and I had a fallout over wedding planning because she was being controlling, and I snapped at her. Now I feel guilty but also justified.",950,1602,0.88,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_65450,2024-02-17 00:00:00,ESH,2085,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Throwaway account because I don't want anyone I know to recognize this. 

I (30M) have a close group of friends, and we've been together since college. A few months ago, one of my friends, Jake (30M), started dating Lily (28F). At first, we all got along well, but things took a turn after a couple of weeks. 

Lily is very outgoing and has a big personality, which is fine, but she also has a habit of making snarky comments about everyone, including me. For example, during our game nights, she'll make fun of my skills, saying things like, ""Wow, did you even go to college?!"" in front of everyone. I tried laughing it off at first, but it began to get under my skin. 

Jake seems oblivious to her remarks and often laughs along, which makes it awkward for me. After a few months of this, I started pulling back from group outings. I didn't want to confront Jake about it since I didn’t want to seem like I was just being sensitive or trying to ruin his relationship. 

At the same time, I noticed that I was not the only one feeling uncomfortable. A couple of our other friends mentioned feeling like they couldn’t say anything without Lily making a dig. We all discussed it privately and agreed that it was getting out of hand. Instead of addressing the issue directly, we collectively decided to hang out less as a group to avoid the tension.

Eventually, Jake confronted me about why I’d been distant. I hesitated and ended up saying I was just busy with work. But the truth is, I’m tired of Lily’s behavior, and I think Jake deserves to know, but I worry about hurting his feelings and potentially losing our friendship.

Everyone sucks here,"A few weeks ago, I had a small gathering at my apartment with some friends. We were just hanging out, playing games, and enjoying some drinks. One of my friends, Alex, brought along his new girlfriend, who I hadn’t met before. Initially, everything was going smoothly, but as the night went on, things took a turn.

Alex’s girlfriend, Sarah, started making comments about the way I decorated my apartment. She referred to my vintage posters as “tacky” and said my furniture looked “cheap.” At first, I tried to brush it off, thinking she was just joking, but she kept going. I could feel my irritation growing, especially since I had put a lot of effort into making my space feel welcoming.

Finally, I snapped and said, “If you don’t like my place, you’re welcome to leave.” It was rude, and I know that now, but I felt backed into a corner. Sarah reacted by saying that she was just being honest and that I was being overly sensitive. That led to a heated argument between the two of us, with Alex trying to mediate but clearly getting frustrated with both of us.

Things escalated and I ended up saying some pretty hurtful things about her taste and how she was “clearly just trying too hard to impress everyone.” In the end, Sarah stormed out, and Alex was really upset with me for not handling the situation better.

Looking back, I realize that I shouldn't have let her comments get to me so much, and I should have addressed it more calmly. But I also think Sarah could have kept her opinions to herself, especially since she was a guest in my home.

After a few rounds of his jabs, I finally snapped and told him to knock it off since it wasn’t funny. He got defensive and started saying I was just jealous of their relationship. 

In the heat of the moment, I also pointed out that he’s not as funny as he thinks he is and that I wasn’t going to let him treat Sarah like that in my home. This led to an awkward silence, and Sarah looked upset. After he left, she said I overreacted and should have talked to him privately instead of calling him out in front of everyone.

Everyone sucks here,"I have a close friend, Sarah, who has been in a steady relationship with her boyfriend, Tom, for about three years. They seem happy together, but lately, Tom has been talking about wanting to move in with Sarah. However, Sarah has been hesitant because she feels like they should take their time and not rush into things. 

I hosted a small gathering at my place and invited a few friends, including Sarah and Tom. During the evening, the topic of living arrangements came up, and Tom expressed how excited he would be to move in with Sarah. I could see Sarah getting increasingly uncomfortable, so I decided to lighten the mood with a joke. I said, ""Maybe you should just set up a tent in her living room for now; that way, you can test the waters first!"" 

The joke didn’t land well, and Sarah shot me a look that made it clear I had crossed a line. Tom laughed awkwardly at first, but then turned serious, saying it wasn’t fair to pressure Sarah. I defended myself, saying I was just trying to be funny and that Sarah needed to be honest about her feelings. 

The atmosphere at the gathering shifted, and Sarah ended up leaving early, visibly upset. Later, I received messages from a couple of friends saying I should apologize for making Sarah uncomfortable and that I shouldn’t have joked about their relationship. I felt like I was just trying to ease the tension, but I realize now it might not have been the right approach.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I’m a bit torn about whether I’m the asshole in this situation. Here’s what happened:

I have a coworker, let’s call her Sarah, who I’ve become friends with over the past year. We often hang out during lunch or after work, but I’ve noticed that she tends to be late for everything. I’m generally pretty punctual, and it drives me a little crazy when I’m waiting around. 

Last week, we planned to go out for dinner after work. I made reservations at a nice restaurant, and Sarah said she’d be ready by 6 PM. So, I finish work, and at 6:15 PM, I text her to see where she is. She replies that she’s running a little late—classic Sarah. I wait until 6:30 PM and then decide to head to the restaurant. I figured I’d just order for her when she arrives since I was already starving. 

When I get to the restaurant, I order my meal and ask them to put in an order for her as well, but I don’t tell the waiter it’s for her—just in case she doesn’t make it in time. About 15 minutes later, Sarah finally arrives, and she looks frazzled. I can tell she’s annoyed that I didn’t wait for her, and she gets really snippy right off the bat. I try to explain that I was hungry and didn’t want to wait any longer, but she’s not having it.

After the initial awkwardness, we start chatting, but the mood is still tense. At one point, I jokingly say something like, “If you’d just be on time once in a while, we wouldn’t have to deal with this.” She gets upset and says I should be more understanding since she has a lot going on in her life right now. I realize that I might have pushed too hard, and I apologize, but she just shrugs it off and says it’s fine.

The dinner ends on a sour note, and we haven’t really talked since. I honestly didn’t think I was being that unreasonable since I’m always waiting for her. But looking back, I guess I could have been more patient. 

So, am I the asshole for not waiting for her and ordering without her? Or was she being overly sensitive?",869,2666,0.85,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_72115,2024-05-11 00:00:00,ESH,1972,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, I (25M) recently went on a hiking trip with a group of friends, including my friend Sarah (24F). We’ve been friends for a few years, and while we’ve always had a good time together, I noticed that Sarah has become increasingly competitive, especially when it comes to outdoor activities.

On this particular hike, Sarah was determined to lead the group and be the first to reach the summit. I found myself feeling pressured to keep up with her pace, even though I wanted to enjoy the hike at a more leisurely speed. I tried to go at my own pace, but she kept encouraging me to push myself harder, which made me feel uncomfortable.

At one point, I made a comment about how I preferred to take my time and enjoy the scenery, and she rolled her eyes and said something like, ""If you want to enjoy the view, you need to get to the top first!"" I brushed it off, but it stuck with me.

As we were nearing the top, Sarah ended up getting really excited and started pushing everyone, including me, to hurry up. I jokingly said, “Chill out, Sarah! It’s just a hike, not a race!” She didn’t take it well and snapped back, calling me lazy and saying I didn’t care about the group.

Feeling defensive, I shot back that maybe if she didn’t act like such a know-it-all, we could all enjoy the hike together. This escalated into a mini-argument, and other friends had to intervene to calm us down. By the time we reached the summit, the mood was pretty tense.

I felt bad for calling her a know-it-all, but I was also frustrated by her constant pressure. After the hike, I apologized for my comment, but she brushed it off, saying I should’ve just kept up. Now, I’m left wondering if I was out of line for speaking up or if she was being too intense. 

So, AITA for calling her out during the hike, or were we both just being jerks?",869,1432,1.0,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_65146,2021-10-21 00:00:00,ESH,1822,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I've been friends with this guy, Tom, for about three years. We met through mutual friends and quickly hit it off. We hung out a lot, and I always thought he was a great friend. However, I also started to develop feelings for him, but I never acted on them because I didn't want to ruin our friendship, especially since I wasn't sure if he felt the same way.

Fast forward to a few months ago, and Tom started dating someone, Sarah. I was initially happy for him, but it stung a bit. They seemed really close, and I felt a bit left out because our dynamic changed. Tom became more focused on his relationship and less available for our usual hangouts. It felt like I was losing my best friend, but I tried to be supportive.

Recently, I started feeling jealous of their relationship, and one night, I drunk-texted Tom saying I missed our old friendship and that I was feeling neglected. He responded, saying he understood, but he was really happy with Sarah and wanted to make it work. I felt embarrassed and immediately deleted the message. 

A week later, we were hanging out with a group of friends, and it turned out Sarah was there too. I felt awkward and decided to ignore her. When we were all laughing and joking, I made a few snarky comments about how Tom used to be so much fun before he got into a relationship. I didn't think much of it at the time, but I could tell Sarah was getting annoyed.

Later, Tom pulled me aside and told me that my comments were hurtful and that I needed to respect his relationship. I got defensive, saying I was just joking and that I was allowed to express how I felt. He countered that it wasn’t fair to put that kind of pressure on him or Sarah and that I was being selfish. I ended up snapping back, saying I never asked him to choose between us, but he could at least acknowledge me when we were together.

Afterward, Sarah confronted me about my behavior, saying I was being passive-aggressive and that it made her uncomfortable. I felt justified in my feelings but realized I might have crossed a line. I tried to explain my side, but it just led to more tension.

Now, I feel like I hurt Tom's feelings, and Sarah is also upset with me. I still think I was just expressing my feelings, but I guess I could have handled it better. I didn't mean to come off as a jerk, but I also think Tom could have been more aware of how he was neglecting our friendship.

We ended up getting into a heated argument. I raised my voice, which I rarely do, but I felt really frustrated.

So, on that day, I was sharing a story about how my parents were planning a family vacation to Europe. I was excited and talking about it when Alex suddenly cut me off and started to talk about his own plans for the summer, dismissing mine as boring. I felt hurt and tried to explain that I was just sharing something that made me happy, but he just rolled his eyes and told me to ""get over myself.""

At that moment, I snapped. I called him selfish and said that if he cared about our friendship, he would at least pretend to be happy for me. He got really defensive and accused me of being overly dramatic. The argument escalated, and I ended up saying some pretty harsh things, like calling him a bad friend and saying he only cares about himself. 

After the argument, I felt guilty and tried to apologize to him, but he wouldn’t talk to me. I then vented to another friend, Jamie, about the situation. Jamie, however, took Alex's side and said that I was the one being dramatic and that I could have handled it better.

Everyone sucks here,"Background Story: My friend group has a tradition of going out for dinner on birthdays, where the birthday person gets to choose the restaurant. Last month, it was my turn to celebrate, and I picked a nice, but relatively expensive, place that I had been wanting to try. My friends were a bit hesitant because they knew it would be pricey, but I insisted it was my special day and I wanted to treat myself. 

When we got to the restaurant, I was excited, but as we started ordering, I could see some of my friends visibly concerned about the bill. To ease the tension, I offered to cover my own meal, but they insisted we should all split the bill evenly, as was our usual practice. I agreed, but I didn’t realize how much it would end up costing each of us.

By the end of the night, the bill was split and I realized I had gone overboard with my choices. I felt guilty when I saw how much my friends were paying for my birthday dinner. Afterward, I jokingly suggested that I would owe them a big dinner in return someday. However, some of my friends were not amused and thought I was being inconsiderate for not being more mindful of their budgets.

A week later, one of my friends confronted me and said that while they appreciated the celebration, I should’ve picked a more affordable place that everyone could enjoy without worrying about the cost. I got defensive, feeling like I was being attacked for wanting to do something nice for myself. I mentioned that it was my birthday and I should be able to celebrate how I want without worrying about everyone else’s finances.

Am I the asshole for wanting to celebrate my birthday at a more expensive restaurant, even if it made some friends uncomfortable?",249,1980,0.62,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_41927,2023-11-27 00:00:00,ESH,1710,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Throwaway account because I don't want anyone I know to see this.

So, here’s the situation. I have a friend, let's call her Sarah, who has been dating this guy, Jake, for about a year. I’ve known Sarah for quite some time, and we have a close friendship. Recently, things have been a bit rocky between Sarah and Jake, and I've been there for her, listening to her frustrations and issues.

One night, Sarah invited me over to hang out and vent about her relationship. I thought it would be a good opportunity for her to talk things out, so I went. During our conversation, I noticed that Jake had been texting Sarah non-stop, and she was getting increasingly upset. In a moment of frustration, I suggested that she should just break up with him if he was causing her this much stress.

Things escalated when Jake showed up unexpectedly. He walked in on us mid-conversation, and I could see the anger in his eyes. Instead of letting it go, I decided to continue the conversation, thinking I was helping Sarah. I told Jake that he was being unreasonable and that if he truly cared about Sarah, he should be more supportive.

Needless to say, Jake got really defensive, and the argument escalated. They ended up having a huge fight right in front of me, and I felt really uncomfortable. I ended up leaving because the situation was so tense.

Afterward, I texted Sarah to check on her, and she told me that I should have kept my mouth shut and that I made things worse by getting involved. I was trying to be a good friend, but now I feel like I may have overstepped. 

So, AITA for butting into their argument and saying what I thought, or should I have just stayed out of it altogether? 

Edit: I realize now that I should have respected Sarah and Jake’s relationship and just let her handle it herself. I guess I was trying to defend her, but it really backfired.",637,2145,0.94,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_69994,2024-10-08 00:00:00,ESH,1864,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My friend group consists of four of us who have been close since college. Recently, we decided to throw a surprise birthday party for one of our friends, Mike. We wanted it to be a fun, memorable event, and we planned everything down to the last detail. However, as we were making plans, my friend Jess kept insisting that we need to invite her boyfriend, Tom, who none of us were particularly fond of. He often shows up uninvited to our gatherings and tends to dominate the conversations with his opinions, which can be quite obnoxious.

One night, while we were discussing the party plans, Jess brought up Tom again. I jokingly said, ""If we invite Tom, I might just as well put a 'no fun allowed' sign on the door."" It was meant to be light-hearted, but Jess didn't take it that way. She got offended and accused me of being rude and disrespectful to her boyfriend. In the heat of the moment, I snapped back and said that I didn't care if she was offended because I was tired of putting up with him.

That led to a pretty heated argument where Jess was yelling about how I was being a bad friend and trying to control who gets invited, while I was trying to explain that I just wanted the party to be enjoyable for everyone. The other two friends in our group tried to mediate, but it only escalated the situation. 

In the end, we decided to invite Tom, and I begrudgingly agreed, but the tension between me and Jess still lingers. Afterward, I told the group that I think Jess is too sensitive and that she should learn to take a joke, and Jess told them I was just a jealous person who wanted to keep her boyfriend away. 

Now, I feel like everyone is annoyed at each other, and I'm not sure who is in the wrong. I think I was justified in my feelings about Tom, but maybe I overreacted in how I expressed them. Looking back, I realize we all contributed to the argument and the fallout.

Everyone sucks here,"I've been friends with Jake for years, but recently things have gotten pretty tense between us. Jake tends to be a bit self-centered and often dominates conversations without realizing it. I’ve tried to be patient, but it can be really frustrating when he dismisses what I say or turns every discussion back to himself.

A few weeks ago, during a group outing, I finally snapped when he interrupted me for the third time while I was sharing a personal story about a tough time I was going through. I called him out in front of everyone, saying he could at least pretend to care about other people's experiences. It was definitely a low blow, and the mood shifted instantly. Jake looked hurt, and the group fell silent.

After that, things got worse. Jake started excluding me from group chats and outings, claiming he needed ""space"" from my negativity. I was upset, feeling both guilty for my outburst and frustrated by his behavior. So, in retaliation, I reached out to a few mutual friends and vented about how Jake always makes everything about himself and how unfair it felt that I was being punished for calling him out. I even shared some personal anecdotes that highlighted his self-absorption.

Things escalated when some of them decided to confront Jake, which led to a huge argument in our friend group. Everyone was taking sides, and it turned into a messy situation with hurt feelings all around. Jake accused me of being manipulative, while I felt betrayed that my friends would side with him so quickly without considering my perspective.

Now, we're all caught up in this drama, and I can't help but feel like both Jake and I crossed lines. It’s created a rift not just between us but within our whole friend group. I regret how things turned out, but it feels like both of us were in the wrong here: me for lashing out, and him for being so oblivious to how his behavior affected others.",915,2920,0.85,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_91523,2021-01-30 00:00:00,ESH,1903,AITA

So, my girlfriend and I have been together for a couple of years, and we’ve had our fair share of arguments, but this one has been weighing heavily on my mind. She has a close group of friends, and they often plan spontaneous trips or outings, which I totally get. However, I feel like I’m often left out of the fun because they don't always invite me or include me in their plans.

A few weeks ago, they planned a weekend trip to the beach, and my girlfriend didn’t mention it to me until the day before they were leaving. I felt hurt and neglected, so I expressed my feelings to her. Instead of really understanding where I was coming from, she got defensive and said that it was just a girls' trip and that I shouldn’t take it personally. In the heat of the moment, I suggested that if she couldn’t include me in her plans, maybe I should start doing the same and plan outings with my friends without her.

Well, that escalated quickly. I ended up planning a weekend trip with my friends to a concert, and when I told her about it, she was furious. She accused me of being immature and trying to one-up her, while I felt like she was being unfair for excluding me in the first place. We both ended up saying some pretty hurtful things, and now we’re in this weird space where we’re both upset with each other.

Everyone sucks here,"I’ll keep this brief.

Last year, my coworker Sarah got promoted to team lead and threw a small celebration at her place. She invited a few of us from work, including me, and it was a fun night. During the party, she mentioned her plans to head to a conference in New York and that she was really looking forward to connecting with other professionals in our field.

Fast forward a few months, and the conference rolls around. I was excited for her and mentioned to her in passing that I’d love to hear about it afterward. To my surprise, she didn’t invite me to go with her. I assumed it was because she was trying to keep costs down or something, but I felt a bit disappointed since I thought we had a good rapport.

Later, I talked to our mutual friend Tom, and he casually mentioned that Sarah had actually invited a different coworker, Liz, to go with her instead. I felt hurt because I thought we were closer, and it stung that she chose someone else over me.

In a moment of frustration, I decided to confront Sarah about it. I brought it up in the office and told her I was really disappointed she hadn’t invited me to the conference. I may have come off a bit too strong and said something like, ""I thought we were friends, but I guess I was wrong."" It was awkward, and she looked taken aback.

Afterward, I realized I may have overstepped. Sarah was just trying to keep her team small and manageable for the conference, and it wasn’t really personal. On the other hand, I felt like she could have been more communicative about why I wasn’t included.

Now, I feel bad for how I handled it and I think I should have just expressed my feelings more calmly instead of accusing her. But Sarah also could have been more considerate about my feelings and maybe explained things better.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I've been friends with Sarah for about five years now. We’ve always been close, sharing everything from relationship advice to career struggles. Recently, she started dating Mike, who I’ve known casually through mutual friends for a while. Mike seems like a decent guy, and he’s nice to Sarah, so I was happy for them.

About a month into their relationship, Sarah started getting really busy with work and didn’t have much time for our usual hangouts. I thought it was great that she was focusing on her career, but it did leave me feeling a bit sidelined. To keep myself busy, I started hanging out with Mike a bit more, mostly in group settings. We both love hiking, and I figured it’d be fine to go on a couple of hikes together since Sarah was unavailable.

One day, Mike texted me out of the blue, asking if I wanted to join him for a hike on Saturday. I figured it would be a nice way to spend the day, so I agreed, thinking it was just a friendly outing. I didn’t think to ask Sarah about it since I assumed she would understand that we were all friends.

After the hike, Mike posted a few pictures of us on Instagram, including one where we were standing together on a scenic overlook, both smiling. Sarah saw the post and went off on me. She accused me of trying to steal Mike away from her and said I should have known better than to hang out with him alone. I was caught off guard because I really didn’t think it was a big deal, and I had no intention of coming between them.

In my defense, I told her that I never meant to upset her and that I viewed it as just hanging out with a friend. But instead of calming down, she became even more upset, saying I was betraying our friendship by getting close to her boyfriend. I tried to explain that it was innocent, but she just wouldn’t listen.

Feeling frustrated, I decided to vent to a few friends about the situation, and some of them sided with her, saying I should have respected her boundaries. Others said Sarah was overreacting. In hindsight, I shouldn’t have mentioned her reaction to our mutual friends, as that just added more fuel to the fire.

Now, it’s really awkward between us. We’ve both said things we regret, and while I think she’s acting a bit dramatic, I can see how she might feel threatened. I just wanted to have a good time, but now I feel like I’ve lost a friend over this whole thing.

We ended up screaming at each other, and I threw in some comments about how she’s always acting like she’s better than everyone because she keeps the place so spotless.

As the night went on, one of my friends, Jess, brought some popcorn and a few bags of chips. I noticed that she was being unusually quiet compared to her usual self. I asked her if everything was okay, and she just shrugged it off, saying she was tired. I didn’t think much of it at the time.

Later in the evening, we were all sitting around, and I brought out a homemade pizza I had made. Everyone was digging in, but I noticed Jess still wasn’t eating much. I jokingly said, “Come on, Jess! Don’t be shy. It’s not going to bite you!” She shot me a glare and said, “Maybe if you weren’t so obsessed with food, I’d actually want to eat.” I was taken aback, and felt embarrassed.

Feeling defensive, I snapped back, “Well, if you wanted to eat, maybe you should have brought something better than a bag of chips!” The mood shifted immediately, and the rest of our friends looked uncomfortable. Jess got really upset and left the room, saying she didn’t want to be part of the night anymore. I felt bad but was also frustrated that she had come at me so harshly.

After she left, I kind of vented my feelings to the others, saying I didn’t understand why she had to be so rude. Some agreed with me, while others felt I should have just let it go.

A few months ago, I (28M) reconnected with an old friend from high school, let’s call her Sarah (27F). We fell out of touch after graduation, but thanks to social media, we started chatting again, and everything seemed great. We decided to meet up for coffee, and I was genuinely excited to catch up.

When we met, I couldn’t help but notice that she seemed quite different from the person I remembered. It wasn’t just a change in appearance; I felt a shift in her personality too. Sarah had always been a bit shy and reserved, but now she was very outgoing and, honestly, a bit confrontational. I found myself feeling uncomfortable as she made some jokes that crossed the line for me, especially when she started poking fun at some of our old classmates, which felt unnecessary. 

During our conversation, she mentioned her new job and how she was thriving, and I tried to be supportive. However, when I shared my own struggles with work, she dismissed them, saying I just needed to “get over myself.” I was taken aback by her lack of empathy. I responded with something like, “Wow, it’s not that easy for everyone, you know?” and she shot back, “Well, maybe if you tried harder, it wouldn’t be a problem.”

At that point, the mood shifted. I felt frustrated and hurt, and I snapped at her, saying she had changed into someone I didn’t recognize. We ended up having a heated argument in the café, which drew the attention of other customers. It was embarrassing, and I ended up leaving abruptly.

I live in a small apartment complex with limited parking, and we both have assigned spots. However, there’s one spot that’s been vacant for a while, and I occasionally park there when my spot is taken by guests. I figured since it was empty, it wouldn’t hurt anyone.

Last week, I came home after a long day at work to find my car parked in that empty spot. My neighbor, who I’ll call Tom, was waiting for me outside.

I work in a small office with a tight-knit group of coworkers, and we often enjoy lunch together. Lately, one of my coworkers, Mike, has been bringing in homemade dishes that are typically really good. However, lately, they’ve become increasingly elaborate and heavy, which some of us have found difficult to digest during our lunch breaks. 

Last week, Mike brought in a massive casserole loaded with cheese, bacon, and various meats. I hadn’t been feeling great that day, but I didn’t want to hurt his feelings, so I took a small portion. During lunch, Mike went on and on about how he spent hours cooking it and how it was his family's recipe. Meanwhile, other coworkers were struggling to finish their portions.

When I returned, I overheard Mike telling another coworker that people should “just toughen up” when it comes to food. Feeling a bit irritable and still queasy, I snapped and told him that not everyone has the same appetite and that he should consider that not everyone wants to eat heavy dishes every day. It was a bit harsher than I intended, and Mike looked really hurt.

Last week, our family had a small get-together to celebrate my mom’s birthday. I was excited to see everyone and catch up, but I knew Lisa would be there, and I wasn’t sure how the evening would go. During dinner, Lisa started telling a story about her recent vacation, and it quickly became a long monologue that took over the entire table.

I felt frustrated and snapped back that not everything had to be about her and that it was my mom's birthday, not hers.

By the end of the night, there was tension between my brother and me, and Lisa was clearly upset. I later received a message from Mark saying I owed Lisa an apology for ruining her story. I told him I would consider it, but I felt it was important to stand up for my mom.

Everyone sucks here,"My friend and I have been close for years, but recently we've started clashing over our different lifestyles. I live a pretty laid-back life, working from home and enjoying my free time, while she has a demanding job that requires her to work long hours. 

A few weeks ago, she invited me to her place for a movie night. I was looking forward to it, but when I arrived, I found her stressed out and on edge, constantly checking her phone for work messages. The movie she had picked turned out to be one she had already seen a million times, and she spent half the time lamenting about her job and how overwhelmed she felt.

I tried to lighten the mood by suggesting something more fun, like playing a board game or watching something new. She snapped at me, saying she just wanted to relax and didn’t want anything too intense. Honestly, I was a bit hurt because I felt like she wasn't open to having fun together.

So, feeling frustrated, I decided to whip out my phone and start playing some games quietly. I thought it might at least distract me from the heavy atmosphere. She noticed and got furious, saying I was being rude and not respecting her need for a chill evening. I shot back that maybe if she wasn’t so focused on her job, we could have enjoyed the night better.

Things escalated, and we ended up fighting. She accused me of being inconsiderate, and I told her she was being overly dramatic and needed to relax. In the end, we both ended the night angry and feeling misunderstood.

Mark has been going through a tough time lately, dealing with a breakup and all the emotional baggage that comes with it. I totally get that he needs support, and I've been trying to be there for him as much as I can. The problem is, he has started to lean on me a bit too much. He calls me almost every day, wanting to talk about his feelings, and it’s starting to feel overwhelming.

Last week, I had a really busy day at work, and I was exhausted. Mark called in the evening, and instead of the usual supportive conversation, he started going on and on about how sad he was over his ex. I tried to redirect the conversation, suggesting that maybe we could talk about something else or even make plans to hang out and do something fun. But he just kept dwelling on his heartbreak.

Frustrated, I snapped and said, “You know, it’s been months. Maybe it’s time to just move on and stop whining about it.” I immediately regretted it, but it just came out. Mark was silent for a moment, then he hung up on me. I felt bad afterward, but I was also tired of the same conversation.

A couple of days later, I reached out to him to apologize and see if we could talk things out, but he hasn’t responded. Now I’m feeling guilty for how I reacted, but I also think he needs to find a way to cope without putting everything on me.

I felt hurt and dismissed, so I called her out on it. I told her that I wasn’t looking for a competition and that I just needed her to listen. She got defensive and said I was being self-centered for not also caring about her issues, accusing me of only wanting to talk about myself. 

In the heat of the moment, I told her she was being inconsiderate and that she didn’t care about our friendship if she couldn’t even be there for me when I needed it. We both ended up raising our voices and saying some pretty hurtful things.

I often do my laundry on weekends, and Sarah has a habit of leaving her clothes in the washer for hours, sometimes even overnight. This really annoys me because it means I can’t do my laundry when I want to.

Last month, I ended up waiting for her clothes to be done so I could wash mine. After two hours, I decided to move her clothes to the dryer and start my wash. I figured she’d check the laundry room soon and wouldn’t mind since I was just trying to get my laundry done.

Well, Sarah found out and was furious. She confronted me and said it was rude to touch her things, even if they were just sitting there. I apologized, but I also told her that she needed to be more considerate about removing her clothes in a timely manner. That turned into an argument, and we both ended up saying some hurtful things.

To be honest, I was really frustrated and in the heat of the moment, I mentioned that I was sick of her attitude and that it would be nice if she could take a bit of responsibility. In retaliation, she started leaving her clothes in the washer even longer just to spite me. Now, every time I do laundry, it feels like a battle.

We've known each other for over a decade and have always been there for each other through thick and thin. Recently, though, things have taken a turn because of a situation that arose when we went on a weekend trip together.

We planned this trip a few months in advance, and I was super excited about it. However, just a few days before we were set to leave, I found out that my grandmother had passed away. It was a really tough time for me, and I was considering skipping the trip to focus on grieving and being with my family. I ended up going, though, because I thought it would be good for me to get away and distract myself.

During the trip, Jake and Sam were both trying to cheer me up, which was sweet, but they also wanted to party and have a good time. They seemed to completely forget about my loss at times, and it felt like they were more focused on having fun than being supportive. I tried to go along with things, but there were moments when I just couldn't enjoy myself and felt really out of place.

At one point, after a night of partying, Jake made a joke about how I needed to lighten up and stop being a downer. I lost it and told him that he was being insensitive, especially given the circumstances. Sam jumped in to defend Jake, saying that I was being rude for ruining the mood. We ended up having a huge argument, and I felt like they both turned against me.

After we got back, I reached out to apologize for my outburst, but I also expressed how hurt I was by their behavior during the trip. They were upset with me for making them feel bad when they were just trying to help. I feel like we’ve all crossed some lines and hurt each other’s feelings, but I can't shake the feeling that I was just expecting a bit more sensitivity from my friends.

Everyone sucks here,"My brother and I have always had a rocky relationship. Growing up, he was the “golden child” in our parents’ eyes. He excelled in school, sports, and had a string of friends, while I often felt like the overlooked sibling. This led to a lot of resentment on my part, and I struggled to connect with him.

As we became adults, things didn't improve much. He has a stable job, a nice apartment, and is generally pretty successful, while I’ve been bouncing between low-paying jobs and living in a shared house. I tried to explain my struggles to him, hoping for understanding, but he often dismissed my feelings, saying I needed to “get my life together.”

Recently, he invited me to his housewarming party. I was hesitant because I knew most of his friends would be there, and I didn’t want to feel out of place. However, he insisted it wouldn’t be the same without me, so I agreed to come. But as the date approached, I felt increasingly anxious about it. I wasn't sure I would fit in, and I struggled with feelings of inadequacy.

The night of the party, I was getting ready when my brother texted me to remind me to bring a bottle of wine, which felt like a last-minute obligation. I snapped back, telling him it felt ridiculous to bring something when he had everything he needed. I ended up not going at all. I felt overwhelmed and like I would just be a burden or a downer at his celebration.

My brother was understandably upset when I didn’t show up. He texted me, saying I ruined the evening and that I was being selfish for not attending. I got defensive and brought up how he always makes me feel inferior and how I was tired of pretending everything was fine between us. We ended up having a huge argument over text, both of us saying hurtful things we regretted later.

Everyone sucks here,"I was at a local grocery store during a busy Saturday afternoon. The place was packed, and the lines at the checkout were long. I was waiting in line behind a woman who had a full cart of groceries and seemed to be in a hurry.

As we waited, she started to complain loudly about the wait, calling out to the cashiers and saying things like, “This is ridiculous! Do you even have enough staff to handle a weekend?” Her tone was really harsh, and I could see others in line rolling their eyes.

I tried to be patient, but then I overheard her saying to the cashier, “You should know better than to keep people waiting like this. Hurry up!” At that point, I lost my cool. I said loudly, “Maybe if you weren’t buying half the store, you wouldn’t be in such a rush!” The woman turned around, clearly taken aback, and shot me a dirty look.

Things escalated when she snapped back, “At least I’m buying my groceries! Some people just stand around and do nothing!” This made me even angrier, so I responded, “Maybe if you were less rude, you’d get served faster!” 

Other customers were now watching us, and some even laughed at the exchange. I felt justified in my response, but I could see the woman getting more frustrated, and it turned into a shouting match between us. Eventually, the manager came over to calm us down, and we both got scolded for making a scene.

Everyone sucks here,"***\~background\~***

I (28M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (27F) for about three years. We recently moved in together after talking about it for a long time. I work a demanding job that often requires me to stay late, and my girlfriend works part-time and also attends school. We both contribute to the rent and bills equally.

Before moving in, I was always the one who handled the finances and scheduling, while she managed the cleaning and chores at her place. I thought this division of labor would continue smoothly, but I quickly realized that I have very different expectations when it comes to household responsibilities.

I grew up in a house where my parents did everything for me, so I honestly never learned how to maintain a home. I assumed living together would be a joint effort. However, I found myself getting overwhelmed with work and often coming home too exhausted to help out around the house. My girlfriend is usually understanding, but I can tell she’s starting to feel resentful.

Last week, things came to a head. I had a particularly stressful week at work, and on top of that, I had a few late nights that left me completely drained. When I came home one day, I found the apartment in a bit of a mess. My girlfriend had been busy with her classes and part-time job, but she made a snarky comment about how I never lifted a finger to help. I felt attacked and responded defensively, pointing out that I was working hard to pay the bills.

This led to a huge argument where we both said things we didn’t mean. I accused her of not understanding how hard I work, and she accused me of being lazy and disrespectful of her efforts. In the heat of the moment, I said I didn't think I could keep living like this if she was going to keep berating me about housework. She shot back that maybe I wasn’t cut out for living with someone if I couldn’t handle basic chores.

After we calmed down, we tried to talk it out, but it just ended up in more fighting about who does what. I felt like she didn’t appreciate the sacrifices I was making by working so many hours, and she felt like I wasn’t contributing at home, which was valid.

When I arrived, she mentioned she was hosting a small dinner party with some of our mutual friends later that evening. I offered to bring a dessert, thinking it would be a nice gesture.

On my way to her place, I stopped by a bakery that I love. There was a beautiful cake on display that I decided to buy. It wasn't cheap, but I thought it would be a great addition to the dinner party. When I got to my friend’s house, she was busy preparing the main course and didn’t really acknowledge the cake at first, but I felt good about my contribution.

As guests started to arrive, I noticed one of them, Sarah, looking at the cake with a mix of curiosity and annoyance.

I was planning on making a homemade dessert, but I guess that’s out the window now.” I tried to lighten the mood by saying, “Well, you can’t compete with a bakery!” but she didn’t seem amused.

Later on, when it was time for dessert, my friend cut into the cake, and everyone started serving themselves. Sarah looked increasingly upset and eventually said, “I just don’t understand why you’d buy a cake when I was going to bring my famous brownies.

The tension escalated, and in a moment of frustration, I snapped back, “Well, if you were so concerned about it, maybe you should have said something before I bought the cake!” This only made things worse, and my friend had to step in to diffuse the situation.

When I arrived, I noticed that Jake had prepared a bunch of healthy dishes and had specifically mentioned that he wanted everyone to eat healthily. I appreciated the effort but felt a bit uncomfortable since I was looking forward to enjoying something indulgent. I brought a dessert, a homemade chocolate cake, thinking it would be a nice treat for everyone. I thought it would be a fun addition to the meal.

During the dinner, Jake made a comment about avoiding processed sugar and how everyone should be mindful of their diets. I felt a bit called out, even though I hadn’t said anything. To make light of the situation, I joked that life is too short to skip dessert, and I should have brought salad instead of cake. Jake didn’t find it funny and responded by saying that he was trying to create a healthy environment and that dessert was exactly what he was trying to avoid.

Feeling a bit embarrassed, I told him that it was just a cake and that he didn’t have to ruin the fun by being overly serious about it. I mentioned that he had been really intense about his fitness goals and that not everything has to be about health all the time. The mood became awkward, and I could see some of the other guests were uncomfortable.

I yelled about how I felt disrespected and how I shouldn’t have to come home to a pigsty.

I’ve always been supportive of their relationship, even though I had some reservations because I’ve noticed that Mike can be quite possessive and controlling at times. Sarah seemed happy, though, so I kept my concerns to myself.

Recently, Sarah confided in me that she felt overwhelmed by Mike’s demands. He often dictates what she should wear and who she should hang out with. I encouraged her to have an open conversation with him about her feelings, suggesting that communication is key in any relationship.

Fast forward a couple of weeks, I found out that they had a big argument. Sarah called me in tears and said she was thinking about breaking up with him, but was scared of how he would react. I did my best to support her and told her that her well-being should come first. After that, I decided to reach out to Mike directly to express my concerns about how he treats her. I thought it might help to give him an outside perspective since I genuinely care about Sarah.

That didn’t go well. Mike confronted me and accused me of meddling in their relationship. He was furious and said I had no right to tell him how to treat his girlfriend. I felt taken aback and ended up arguing with him, defending my intentions but letting my temper get the best of me. I called him controlling and said he was the reason Sarah was unhappy.

After that confrontation, I felt bad about how things escalated, and I realized I probably crossed a line by contacting him directly. I reached out to Sarah to apologize for involving myself in her relationship and told her that I only wanted what’s best for her. But she was upset that I spoke to him and felt I had betrayed her trust by not respecting her autonomy.

A little while later, one of them, a guy named Mark, got up and made a comment about how “certain people” shouldn’t throw parties because they tend to get out of hand. I felt singled out, and I couldn’t help but respond.

I told him that I was just trying to be friendly and build a sense of community, and that maybe he should lighten up. This led to an argument where I called him uptight and he called me inconsiderate. It escalated quickly, and soon everyone was awkwardly staring at us.

Instead of diffusing the situation, I decided to further air my grievances. I pointed out how his attitude was exactly what keeps people from wanting to socialize. This led to more heated exchanges, and soon others were chiming in with their opinions, some agreeing with me and some with Mark.

Everyone sucks here,"I (35F) have been friends with Sarah (34F) for over a decade. We have always had a close bond, but the past few years have been a rollercoaster. Sarah has been struggling with her mental health, which has affected her relationships, work, and overall well-being. I’ve always tried to be supportive, listening to her and encouraging her to seek help. 

Recently, Sarah went through a particularly tough time and started isolating herself from everyone. I noticed that she was missing important events, including my birthday party. I was hurt but understood she was going through a lot. After a few weeks of not hearing from her, I reached out to check on her, and she opened up about feeling overwhelmed and not wanting to burden anyone.

In my attempt to help, I suggested that she come stay with me for a week. I thought being in a supportive environment might help her feel better. She agreed but when she arrived, things didn't go as planned. Sarah was still very withdrawn and seemed to be stuck in a funk. I tried to encourage her to go for walks, visit friends, or do activities we used to enjoy, but she refused.

Frustrated, I confronted her one day about her lack of engagement. I told her that she was being overly negative and that it was exhausting for me to try to lift her spirits if she didn't want to meet me halfway. She got defensive and accused me of not being understanding of her struggles. We ended up having a huge argument where I said some things I regretted, implying that she was being selfish for not trying harder to get better while she was staying with me.

After she left, she stopped speaking to me. I’ve been feeling guilty for how I reacted during our argument, but I also feel that she needs to take some responsibility for her situation. It’s hard to support someone who isn’t willing to help themselves. 

So, am I the asshole for calling her out during a tough time, or was I justified in my frustration?",356,2165,0.76,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_79833,2018-06-21 00:00:00,ESH,1943,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I'm in my early 30s, and I have a close friend, Mia, who is in her late 20s. We’ve known each other for over 10 years, and we’ve always leaned on each other through tough times. Mia has struggled with anxiety and depression for most of her adult life, and I’ve tried my best to support her.

Recently, Mia had a breakup that hit her hard. She fell into a dark place, and while I wanted to help, I started to notice she was becoming increasingly reliant on me emotionally. She would call me at all hours, often crying or venting about her ex, and I would do my best to be there for her. However, I also have my own life, work, and responsibilities, and I began to feel overwhelmed.

Last week, after a particularly exhausting day, Mia called me late at night, sobbing about how she felt alone and abandoned. I was tired and a bit frustrated. In a moment of weakness, I snapped and told her that I couldn't be her emotional crutch anymore, and that she needed to seek professional help instead of relying on me all the time. She hung up on me, and I felt terrible for how I handled it.

The next day, Mia posted about our conversation on social media, painting me as a bad friend who abandoned her in her time of need. I reached out to her, trying to explain my perspective and that I genuinely care about her, but I also need space to handle my own life. She was upset and accused me of not understanding her pain and of being selfish.

Looking back, I think I should have approached the situation differently, and I do regret how I spoke to her. At the same time, I feel like she put a lot of pressure on me to be her sole support system without recognizing my own struggles.

Everyone sucks here,"Last month, my friend Emily invited me to a party she was hosting for her birthday. I was excited to celebrate with her and catch up with some mutual friends. However, a few days before the party, I found out that my boyfriend, Jake, had planned a surprise trip for the two of us to a nearby city on the very same weekend. I was torn between going to Emily's party and spending time with Jake, who had put a lot of effort into planning this trip. 

I decided to go to the party for a couple of hours before heading off on the trip. When I arrived, I noticed that Emily seemed a bit off. She had told me earlier that she was feeling overwhelmed with planning everything and was stressed about getting everyone together. I tried to reassure her and help out, but I could tell she was still feeling down.

As the night went on, I kept glancing at my phone, waiting for Jake to text me about when we should leave for the trip. I ended up stepping outside to take a call from him while Emily was in the middle of opening her gifts. When I returned, Emily seemed upset and confronted me about being distracted and not fully present at her party. I apologized, but I explained that I was just trying to juggle both commitments.

Instead of calming down, Emily got more upset and accused me of prioritizing Jake over her birthday. I felt bad, but I also believed I had a right to enjoy my relationship. In the heat of the moment, I snapped back, telling her that I had made time for the party and it wasn’t my fault she felt neglected. 

Things escalated, and we ended up having a heated argument in front of our friends. Eventually, I left the party feeling frustrated and guilty. I did send Emily a message later that night to apologize for arguing, but I also expressed that I didn’t think I had done anything wrong by wanting to spend time with Jake.

She often complains about how her workload is heavier than everyone else's, even though we all have our own deadlines and projects. I try to be supportive, but it gets exhausting hearing her constantly vent about it. 

One day, she was particularly upset and started crying in the break room about how she couldn't handle it anymore. I was trying to be empathetic, but I also mentioned that maybe she should talk to our manager about redistributing some tasks. She got really defensive and accused me of not caring about her struggles. Honestly, I thought I was just being practical, but I ended up feeling bad for suggesting that.

Later that week, I was venting to another coworker about the situation and how I felt like I couldn’t express my own frustrations without being attacked. I may have said something like, “Honestly, I think she just likes the attention,” which I didn't really mean to be a harsh judgment, but it slipped out.

Sarah found out that I said this, and she confronted me in front of the whole team. I tried to explain myself, but it just turned into a big argument where both of us ended up airing out our grievances. It was super awkward and unprofessional, and now our whole team feels the tension.

Everyone sucks here,"Last week was my best friend’s wedding. We’ve been friends for over a decade, and I was honored to be a groomsman. The wedding was beautiful, and I was excited to celebrate this new chapter in his life.

However, there’s some history between us. A few years ago, I dated a girl he was interested in. At the time, he never made his feelings known, but after I broke up with her, he confessed that he had feelings for her too. This caused a rift between us for a while, but we eventually worked things out. I thought we were in a good place, and I was genuinely happy for him.

During the reception, things got a bit awkward. The DJ started playing some nostalgic songs from our college days, and I got a little carried away on the dance floor. I was trying to have fun and maybe show off a bit, but then I jokingly brought up the time we both liked the same girl. I thought it would be a funny icebreaker since the atmosphere was light-hearted.

Instead, my friend looked visibly uncomfortable. I persisted, thinking he was just being modest, and I made a few more jokes about his crush on her and how he lost out to me. I thought it was all in good fun, but then he snapped at me to stop. I felt embarrassed and tried to lighten the mood by laughing it off, but he stormed off to the bar.

The mood shifted after that. People started talking about how I had ruined the vibe, and I overheard some guests saying I was being an asshole. I later confronted my friend to apologize, but he just told me I was being insensitive and to think before I speak next time.

Now I’m feeling conflicted. I thought we had moved past the whole situation, and I didn’t mean to hurt him. But at the same time, I feel like he overreacted and didn’t appreciate my intentions. Was I out of line, or is he being too sensitive? AITA?",407,502,0.79,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_62403,2020-09-22 00:00:00,ESH,1809,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"A few weeks ago, my partner and I broke up after a long relationship. The breakup was tough for both of us, and we had a lot of shared friends, which made it even more complicated. 

After the split, I turned to one of my close friends for support, someone I've known for years. We started spending more time together, and it felt comforting to have someone who understood what I was going through. We would talk about our feelings and vent about life, and it felt like we were both healing together.

One night, after a few drinks, we ended up kissing. It was impulsive and unexpected, and while part of me enjoyed it, I also felt guilty because I knew how sad my ex was about our breakup. The next day, my friend and I both agreed that it had been a mistake and that we should probably just go back to being friends.

However, word got out to our mutual friends, and I started hearing whispers that I was being disloyal to my ex. Some of my friends even called me out for “moving on too quickly” and said I was being insensitive. I felt cornered and didn’t know how to respond, so I snapped at a few of them, saying they had no idea what I was going through.

Now, my friend feels awkward around me, and some of our mutual friends have taken sides. I regret the kiss and the way I reacted to my friends, but at the same time, I feel like they were too harsh on me for trying to cope in my own way.

I was more of the quiet and introverted one, and while I'm happy for her successes, it sometimes felt like there was a constant comparison that I could never live up to.

Last month, she got engaged, and I'm genuinely happy for her. But when it came time to plan the engagement party, she went all out and made it a huge event, inviting family, friends, and even some of her co-workers. I offered to help organize it, thinking it would be a good way to bond with her, but she brushed me off and said she had everything under control.

The day of the party, I was invited but didn't want to be just a guest. I decided to show up early to help set up anyway. I brought some decorations and helped with food prep, but my sister was annoyed that I hadn’t waited for her to ask for help. She ended up snapping at me in front of her friends, which embarrassed me. In my frustration, I accidentally knocked over a tray of appetizers, and of course, she lost it, yelling at me about how I ruined everything.

The next day, my boyfriend found out about the kiss and was furious. He couldn’t believe I would betray him like that, especially after he explained that he had just been having fun with his friends. I tried to explain that I felt neglected and scared, but he just saw it as me being unfaithful.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I recently had a confrontation with my neighbor that’s been weighing on me. 

To give you some context, I've lived in my apartment for a couple of years now, and my neighbor, let's call him Dave, has a habit of playing loud music late into the night. I’ve tried talking to him about it a few times, but he always brushes me off, saying it’s his right to enjoy his music. I get it, but I also have a job that requires me to wake up early, and it’s hard to sleep with bass thumping through the walls.

One night, after a particularly rough week, I was exhausted and just wanted a peaceful night. Around 11 PM, Dave started blasting his music again. I tried to ignore it, but it was impossible. After an hour, I decided I’d had enough. Instead of going over to his apartment, which I figured wouldn’t help, I opted to blast some of my own music as a form of protest. 

I turned up my stereo, and suddenly the vibe turned into a full-blown battle of the bands. I thought this might make him realize how annoying it was to have music blasting at that hour. But instead, it seemed to escalate the situation. Dave came out into the hallway yelling at me to turn it down, and I yelled back that he should turn his down first. It was a ridiculous shouting match, with both of us escalating things instead of backing down.

At one point, I called him inconsiderate, and he shot back that I was just an uptight person who couldn’t handle a little fun. We both ended up cursing at each other, and it felt like a childish argument that got way out of hand. 

Eventually, we both just slammed our doors shut and went back inside. I felt embarrassed after, realizing I had lowered myself to his level instead of handling it like an adult. The next day, I actually saw him at the mailbox, and we awkwardly avoided each other’s eyes.

I found myself feeling envious and frustrated that she’s moving forward while I feel stuck.

Last week, during a group dinner, my friend was sharing her wedding plans, and the excitement was contagious. But inside, I felt resentment bubbling up. Instead of keeping my mouth shut, I made a snarky comment about how planning a wedding is easy when you don’t have to worry about actually making a commitment. It was rude and unnecessary, and my friend was understandably hurt. I instantly regretted it, but the damage was done.

Over time, I've learned that he has some pretty intense opinions on various topics, especially politics and social issues. While I generally like to keep things light and avoid heavy debates, Mark has a knack for bringing these subjects up in our conversations, often without considering my perspective.

Honestly, both of us were being pretty stubborn and rude. I should have just let it go and avoided the argument, but I felt like I needed to stand up for myself. Mark, on the other hand, has a history of dismissing people’s feelings when they don't align with his, so I think he could have handled it better too.

Sarah would often make snide comments about how I was a bad influence or how Jake should focus on his relationship and not spend so much time with me.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I’ve been in a bit of a conflict lately with my roommate, Jake, and I’m not sure how to feel about it. We’ve been living together for about a year, and it’s generally been smooth sailing until now.

A few weeks ago, Jake had a couple of friends over for a movie night. I was out running errands when I got a text from him asking if I could bring home some snacks. I was already on my way back, and I figured I’d grab some chips and soda since I didn't want to disappoint them. When I got home, I found out that Jake had invited more people than I expected, and they were all lounging in the living room.

To be honest, I felt a bit uncomfortable being the only one not in the loop about this gathering, especially since it was a last-minute decision. I tried to join in and be friendly, but they were loud and joking around, and I felt a bit like an outsider. At one point, I overheard one of Jake’s friends making a comment about me, saying something like, ""I don't know why he even bothers living here, he’s never around."" 

That really struck a nerve. I know I’m not home as much because I have a job with long hours, but I do pay my share of rent and bills. I decided to make my presence known. I turned to Jake’s friend and said, “Well, maybe if you weren’t always taking over the living room, I’d have more time to be here.” I didn’t think it would escalate, but Jake got upset with me for saying that, and it turned into a mini-argument between us.

Afterward, I felt bad because it really wasn’t fair to lash out at his friends, but I also felt like Jake should’ve given me a heads-up about having a big gathering. We’ve talked about how we both value our space and time at home.

Now, I’m stuck wondering if I was in the wrong for speaking up or if Jake should have been more considerate of my feelings.

At this point, the whole group started laughing, and it made me even angrier. I called them out for being inconsiderate, and things escalated quickly. I said something along the lines of, “You’re all just a bunch of immature college kids who think the world revolves around you.” 

They didn’t take kindly to that, and one girl from the group threw a sugar packet at me, which hit the table and spilled everywhere. I stood up and told them they were pathetic for acting like that in public.

Eventually, the barista intervened, asking us to calm down and suggested that I find another spot to work if it was bothering me so much. I felt embarrassed and frustrated, but I left without saying another word. 

Looking back, I realize I could have handled it better, and maybe they were just trying to enjoy their time like everyone else. But I also think they could have been more respectful to those around them. So, AITA for standing up for myself, or are we all just a bit at fault here?

Everyone sucks here,"I (28F) have a younger brother, Jake (24M), who has been in a long-term relationship with his girlfriend, Sarah (23F). They’ve been together for about three years, and I always thought they were a good match. However, recently, I found out that Jake has been considering proposing to her.

Last weekend, we had a family gathering, and I overheard a conversation between Jake and our mom about his plan to propose soon. I was excited for him but also a little concerned because I’ve sensed some red flags in their relationship. Sarah can be controlling at times, and I've seen her manipulate situations to get her way, which worries me for Jake’s future happiness.

I decided to talk to Jake about it. I told him how I felt and expressed my concerns about Sarah's behavior. I wasn’t trying to tell him what to do, just to make him aware of my observations. Jake got really defensive and accused me of meddling in his life. He said that I was being negative and that he loves Sarah, and that should be enough for me to support him. 

Feeling hurt by his reaction, I ended up telling him that if he proposes to her, I won’t support the relationship or attend the wedding. I thought it would make him reconsider, but instead it created a huge rift between us. He told me I was being an asshole and that I should mind my own business.

Now, I feel guilty for the ultimatum I gave him, but I also believe that I was trying to protect him. I spoke with Sarah later, thinking maybe I could get her perspective, but she ended up flipping out on me and told me to stay out of their relationship. 

So now, I’m left wondering if I overstepped by trying to protect my brother but also if Jake should be more receptive to my concerns. ESH?",265,2373,0.56,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_95964,2023-01-16 00:00:00,ESH,1726,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"My best friend has been dating this guy for about a year now. When they first started seeing each other, I was really supportive and excited for her, but over time, I’ve started to notice some red flags. He’s dismissive of her opinions, and there have been times I've seen him speak to her in a condescending way. I’ve tried to gently bring it up to her, but she always brushes it off, saying he’s just joking or that I don’t understand their relationship.

Recently, they attended a party at my place. During the evening, while we were all playing a game, he made a joke at her expense that was pretty harsh. The kind of joke that made everyone uncomfortable, and I could see it hurt her feelings. I felt really bad for her, so I decided to speak up. I called him out on it, saying that it wasn’t funny and that he shouldn’t put her down in front of friends. He got defensive and tried to make it seem like I was overreacting.

She got super upset with me for making the situation awkward, and honestly, I didn’t mean to embarrass her. I just wanted her to see that his behavior wasn’t okay. After the party, she texted me saying that I shouldn’t have interfered and that I was making her relationship harder than it needs to be. I felt guilty for potentially ruining our friendship but also felt justified in what I did.

I later talked to a mutual friend about it, and they said that I shouldn’t have tried to control how she handles her relationship, and that I was out of line for confronting him in front of everyone. I’m starting to feel conflicted. I care about her and want the best for her, but maybe I overstepped my boundaries.

We come from a big family and our parents put a lot of pressure on us to help each other out, especially when it comes to the kids. She has two kids, aged 5 and 7, and I have one 6-year-old. 

A couple of weeks ago, my sister asked me to watch her kids for the weekend because she and her husband wanted to take a short trip. I had plans to go out of town with my family that same weekend, but I felt guilty saying no, especially with our parents pushing for family support. I told her I could only watch them for one day, Saturday, but she insisted that she needed me to take care of them the entire weekend. 

I ended up canceling my plans, which frustrated my family, but I thought it was the right thing to do. However, when they arrived, it became clear that my sister wasn't prepared at all. The kids were wild, and she had left me with no food for them and minimal instructions. I felt overwhelmed because I was also trying to entertain my child and keep everything under control. 

By the time Saturday night rolled around, I was exhausted. My sister texted me asking how it was going, and I vented about how difficult the day had been and how I regretted canceling my plans. She returned with a pretty harsh message about how I should be more supportive and that family is supposed to help each other out. I snapped back, saying that I felt taken advantage of and that she should have been more responsible if she was going to ask for favors. 

When she returned home the next day, we had a huge fight, and I told her I wouldn’t be watching her kids again unless she could prove she was better prepared.

When I mentioned my business to my friend, she seemed indifferent and brushed it off. A few weeks later, she told me she was planning to host a craft fair and asked if I wanted to participate.

I confronted her about it later, and she said she didn't think it was a big deal since we both like similar styles. I told her she should have at least mentioned it to me beforehand, and she got defensive, saying I was being overly sensitive.

I’ve been trying to support her, but sometimes it gets a bit exhausting because it feels like she’s stuck in the past.

Last weekend, we were hanging out at my place, and I decided to plan a little fun night out to cheer her up. I organized a dinner with some friends and made sure to pick a fun restaurant with a lively atmosphere. I even arranged for a karaoke slot afterward since I know Sam used to love singing.

However, during dinner, Sam started bringing up her ex again, talking about how they used to go to the same restaurant and how he loved karaoke. I felt myself getting frustrated. I gently told her that I understood it was hard, but I wanted her to focus on the present and enjoy the night with us. She snapped back, saying I was being insensitive to her feelings. Things got a bit tense, and I ended up saying that if she couldn’t let go of the past for one night, maybe she should stay home next time.

Sam was hurt and ended up leaving early. I felt bad, but also thought she was being a bit unreasonable. A day later, she texted me that she needed some time to think about our friendship.

One night, after a particularly exhausting day at work, the music was blaring until well past midnight. I felt really annoyed and decided to knock on her door to ask her to turn it down. When she opened the door, I could see that she was having a small gathering with some friends. I politely asked if she could lower the volume, explaining that I had an early shift the next morning.

Instead of being understanding, she snapped back at me, saying that it was her apartment and she should be able to enjoy herself. I could feel my irritation bubbling up, so I told her that it was inconsiderate to blast music at that hour when most people in the building were trying to sleep. We ended up getting into a heated argument, where I may have raised my voice and told her she was selfish for not caring about her neighbors. 

Afterwards, I felt bad about how the situation escalated. I understand that I was frustrated, but maybe I overreacted. She has since ignored me in the hallways, and I feel a bit guilty about how I handled it.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I (28M) recently got into a pretty heated argument with my friend (29F) over a situation that happened during a group trip we took last month. We’ve been friends for years, so I thought we’d be able to handle anything together, but this really shook things up.

We all decided to go on a weekend camping trip, and I was excited to be outdoors and spend time with everyone. But right before we left, I found out that my friend was bringing her new boyfriend, who I hadn’t met yet. I’m usually open to meeting people, but I had some reservations because this guy had a reputation for being a bit of a party animal, and our group is more laid-back.

When we arrived at the campsite, everything started off well. But soon after setting up, I realized that her boyfriend was drinking heavily and being pretty loud. I tried to stay out of it and keep my distance, but as the night went on, he started getting more and more obnoxious, making inappropriate jokes and just being a general nuisance. I felt uncomfortable, and I also noticed that my friends were getting annoyed too.

At one point, I snapped and told him to tone it down because we were all trying to enjoy the night, not listen to him scream and act like a fool. My friend got really defensive and told me I was being rude and that I should just lighten up. I ended up saying some things I regret, like that she should be more careful about who she brings into our group, and that maybe she should reconsider if he’s really the right guy for her.

The argument escalated, and I felt like I was being ganged up on because everyone else sided with her, saying I overreacted and should have just dealt with it. I know I was harsh, but I genuinely felt that she needed to hear how her boyfriend was acting. Now, I’m left feeling guilty about how I handled things, and I think I've damaged my friendship with her.

Hey everyone, I’m feeling really confused and could use some perspective. My birthday is coming up, and I’ve been planning a small party with just a few close friends. One of my best friends, Sarah, is someone I’ve known for years. She’s always been there for me, and I really want her to be part of the celebration.

The problem is that Sarah used to date my boyfriend’s best friend, and their breakup was pretty messy. My boyfriend, Jake, has always had a bit of a grudge against Sarah because of how things ended between her and his friend. He’s made it clear that he’s not comfortable with her being around, and when I told him I wanted to invite her, he got upset.

I totally understand where he’s coming from; he doesn’t want to feel awkward or have any tension at the party. But at the same time, I feel like I shouldn’t have to choose between my boyfriend and my best friend.

After a while, I joked with the group that I could probably make something better than Jake's dish without all the weird ingredients. Instead of laughing it off, Jake snapped at me, saying that I was undermining his efforts and that I clearly didn't respect his commitment to fitness.

I got defensive and told him he was being a control freak and that it was just food—no need to take it so seriously. The atmosphere got really tense, and by the end of the night, we had both said some hurtful things. I called him “obsessed” and he told me I was “just jealous” of his success.

I thought it would be a good change for her, especially since she needs a quiet place to study and unwind from her stress.

My son, however, was upset about it. He used to have the office as his gaming space before we moved, and now he feels like he’s being pushed aside. He expressed his frustration, saying it’s unfair that his sister gets her own room while he’s still sharing a room with his little brother, who’s just 7 and very noisy.

I tried to explain that my daughter needs the space more right now due to her anxiety, but my son didn’t take it well. He accused me of favoring her and not caring about his feelings. In a moment of frustration, I snapped back that he needs to be more understanding and that families sometimes have to make sacrifices for each other.

Things escalated when my son started taking out his anger on his sister, making snide comments and even hiding her things.

I have one friend, Sarah, who is always a bit pushy when it comes to the games we play. She has this habit of insisting we play her favorite games, which tend to be long and complex, while others in the group prefer shorter, lighter games. 

Last week, I decided to pick a game that I knew everyone enjoyed - a quick card game that usually leads to lots of laughs.

I felt frustrated, but I didn’t want to escalate things, so I suggested we try my game first and if everyone was still interested afterward, we could see about playing hers. 

As the game went on, Sarah kept making snide comments, like calling the game “childish” and “boring.” I finally snapped and told her that her negativity was ruining the night for everyone, and if she didn't want to play, she could leave.

Now, I understand that I shouldn’t have reacted that way, especially since it was supposed to be a fun catching-up session. But at the same time, I feel like my friend should have been more present and respectful during our time together.

Everyone sucks here,"I've always been a bit of a perfectionist, and that trait definitely spilled over into my parenting style. I want my kids to excel in everything they do, whether it’s academics, sports, or even hobbies. My husband, on the other hand, takes a much more laid-back approach. He believes in letting the kids find their own passions and strengths without the pressure of high expectations.

Recently, my 10-year-old daughter joined a local soccer team. I was thrilled because I've always loved soccer, and I thought it would be a great opportunity for her to develop skills and possibly play competitively. I started training her every weekend, working on drills, practicing shooting, and even going over strategies. I really pushed her to do her best because I didn’t want her to be just another player; I wanted her to be a star.

My husband, however, was concerned that I was putting too much pressure on her. He kept telling me that soccer should be fun for her and that I was making her anxious about performance. I brushed it off, thinking he just didn't understand how important it was to work hard and strive for excellence.

One day, after an intense training session, my daughter came to me in tears. She said she was feeling overwhelmed and didn’t want to practice anymore. I was frustrated because I felt like I was just trying to help her achieve her potential.

This turned into a heated argument between us. I accused him of not caring about our daughter's future or her success, while he accused me of ruining her love for the game. We both ended up yelling and saying things we didn’t mean. My daughter left the room crying, and I felt awful for putting her in the middle of our conflict.

Looking back, I see that I was too intense and didn’t consider my daughter’s feelings, but my husband also wasn’t helping by dismissing my desire for her to excel. We both ended up hurting her.

So, AITA for pushing my daughter too hard, or is my husband the one who is being unreasonable by not wanting her to strive for excellence? Or are we both the assholes for letting our differing parenting styles clash and hurt her in the process?",79,2251,0.99,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_68869,2022-12-07 00:00:00,ESH,2351,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Last week, I was in charge of preparing a big family dinner for my parents' anniversary. I decided to make my mom's favorite lasagna, which is a bit of a labor of love. I spent the entire afternoon cooking, and it turned out great.

After dinner, my mom complimented my cooking, but then she asked why I didn’t make any garlic bread to go with it. I was taken aback because I thought the lasagna was more than enough on its own. I told her that I didn’t think it was necessary and that there would be too much food.

Later that night, my mom and I got into a bit of a heated argument about it. She felt I should have considered her preferences and made the garlic bread, while I felt I had done a great job with the lasagna and should be appreciated for that. I ended up saying that if she wanted garlic bread so badly, she could have made it herself. That really upset her.

In the end, we both said some hurtful things to each other. I feel like I should have been more considerate of her feelings, but I also think she could have appreciated what I did instead of focusing on what I didn’t do.

I’ve always been there for him through his ups and downs, especially after he went through a tough breakup last year. Recently, Jake started dating Sarah, whom I’ve known for a while. She’s nice, but since they got together, everything has changed.

Jake and I used to hang out almost every weekend, but now he’s much more focused on Sarah. At first, I understood. Everyone goes through that phase in a relationship, but it’s been months, and it feels like I'm losing my best friend. I tried to be supportive, but I started to feel frustrated about the lack of communication. I even brought it up with Jake, but he brushed it off, saying I should be happy for him.

One night, I invited him over for a movie night, hoping to rekindle our friendship. He agreed but canceled last minute because Sarah wanted to do something else. That’s when I snapped. I sent him a text suggesting that maybe he should choose between me and her, thinking it would make him realize how much I value our friendship.

The next day, I felt guilty. I shouldn’t have put him in that position, but at the same time, I was tired of feeling neglected. I reached out to Sarah and told her I felt like I was losing Jake because of her, and she responded pretty harshly, saying I was being selfish and should respect their relationship.

Now, I’ve lost my cool with both of them. Jake is upset with me for involving Sarah, and Sarah thinks I’m trying to sabotage their relationship. I guess I just wanted Jake to see how much he was pulling away from me and wanted to reclaim our friendship. I know I’m partly to blame for the drama, but I feel hurt too.

Last weekend, my friends and I went to a karaoke bar to celebrate a birthday. The place was packed, and we were all really excited to sing and have fun. We had a few drinks and were generally in a good mood, laughing and cheering each other on.

After a while, a group of people arrived and took the table next to ours. They seemed to be having a great time, but they were also really loud, which was starting to drown out our singing. I could feel the frustration building in my group. One of my friends, let’s call him Jake, went over to ask them to tone it down a bit. He was pretty polite about it, but they brushed him off and just laughed, claiming they were just having a good time.

Feeling annoyed, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I stood up and shouted, “Hey! Some of us are trying to sing here, can you keep it down?” It was a bit louder than I intended, and the whole bar went quiet for a moment. The group looked at me shocked and then started mocking me, saying things like, “Oh, we’re sorry, karaoke police!” 

It turned into a back-and-forth where both sides were throwing snarky comments at each other. My friends tried to calm me down, but I was already too riled up. Eventually, the manager came over and had to ask both groups to keep it down, which made me feel a bit embarrassed.

On the drive home, I realized that while I wanted to defend my friends and have a good time, I probably overreacted and made the situation worse. I feel like Jake was in the right for trying to handle it calmly, but I definitely escalated things by shouting.

However, one of my friends, let’s call him Mark, started to dominate the conversation with his stories about work. Now, I appreciate that everyone has their own life experiences, but Mark has a tendency to go on and on about his job, and it can get really tedious. I tried to steer the conversation in different directions a few times, but he just kept bringing it back to work.

After about 45 minutes of this, I finally snapped a little and said, “Hey Mark, we love you, but can we talk about something else? It feels like we’re at a work meeting instead of hanging out.” I thought it might be taken lightly, but Mark got really offended and ended up leaving.

Later, I heard from another friend that Mark felt hurt and singled out, and honestly, I feel bad about how I handled it. At the same time, I was frustrated that he couldn’t pick up on the cues that we wanted to change the topic. Now I’m wondering if I was too harsh and if I should have just let him talk.

I have an older brother who is 30 and I’m 27. We grew up in a competitive household where achievements were always highlighted and praised, which led to a lot of pressure on both of us. My brother excelled in school, sports, and basically everything he did, while I struggled to find my own path. This created a gap between us, with him often looking down on my choices and achievements.

Recently, my brother got engaged, and I was excited for him. However, when it came time to plan his bachelor party, he insisted on having it in a city that I couldn’t afford to visit. I spoke up and suggested a more budget-friendly option, but he dismissed my ideas, saying that I should just “make it work” if I cared about being part of the celebration.

Feeling frustrated and hurt, I texted him to let him know that I wouldn’t be able to attend. He responded angrily, saying I was being selfish and that family should support each other. I shot back, telling him that he never supported my decisions or cared about my feelings, so how could I support him? 

This led to a huge argument over text, where we both said things we regretted. I called him entitled, and he called me a failure. We haven't spoken since. 

I feel conflicted because I know I should have tried harder to communicate without getting into a heated argument, but I also think he was being insensitive to my financial situation. I’m starting to realize that we both may have acted poorly in how we handled the situation.

Everyone sucks here,"Last month, I (28F) was invited to my best friend’s wedding. I had known her for years and was excited to celebrate such a big moment in her life. However, a week before the wedding, she reached out to tell me that her estranged father, who had been absent for most of her life, was unexpectedly coming. She mentioned he had just gotten sober and wanted to reconnect, and she asked if I would help her navigate that situation.

Initially, I was supportive and agreed to be there for her. But as the wedding day approached, I started to feel uneasy. I had always felt that her father didn’t deserve a place in her life after abandoning her for so long. The night before the wedding, I had a few drinks and ended up sending her a long message expressing my doubts about her father attending. I told her I thought it would ruin the day and that she deserved better than someone who had hurt her for so many years.

The day of the wedding, I could tell she was stressed about it. When her father arrived, she broke down in tears, and I knew I had to step in. I confronted him and told him he was not welcome there, which led to a very heated argument. My friend was caught in the middle and ended up yelling at both of us. It was a mess, and eventually, she asked me to leave.

After the wedding, I tried to reach out to her, but she has been distant. I feel guilty for how things unfolded, but I also believe I was trying to protect her. My friends say I overstepped and should have just supported her decision instead of trying to control the situation.

Last month, I found out that my sister had been planning a surprise birthday party for our mom, and she didn't invite me. When I asked her about it, she explained that she wanted it to be a small, intimate gathering, and that she felt I wouldn't be able to keep it a secret. Honestly, I was hurt. I felt excluded and unimportant in her plans, especially since I always make an effort to include her in family activities.

In a moment of frustration, I decided to throw my own birthday party for our mom on the same day. I invited all the family members and friends, and I made it clear that it was going to be a big celebration. I thought this would show my sister how it felt to be left out, and that maybe she'd reconsider her choices in the future.

When my sister found out, she was furious. She accused me of ruining her plans and being selfish. I told her that she brought this on herself by not involving me in the first place. It escalated into a huge fight, and now we're not speaking. Our parents are caught in the middle, and they think we both acted immaturely.

She became less available for our plans and started prioritizing Mark over our friendship. I tried to be supportive and let her enjoy her new relationship, but after a few months, it felt like I had lost my best friend.

One weekend, I was looking forward to a girls' night that we had planned for weeks. Jenna canceled at the last minute because Mark invited her to a concert, and she couldn’t say no. I was frustrated, and instead of just letting it go, I texted her and told her I felt like she was choosing Mark over me and that it was unfair. 

Jenna got really upset and told me I was being selfish and that I should be happy for her. She mentioned that I never liked her boyfriends in the past and accused me of trying to control her life. In the heat of the moment, I told her that she was neglecting our friendship for someone who might not even stick around.

We ended up arguing over text, and I said some hurtful things. I felt bad afterward and tried to apologize, but she hasn’t responded to me since.

Sarah has always been extremely talented when it comes to painting and has had some small exhibitions. I admire her work and often support her by attending shows and sharing her art on social media.

Recently, I started taking pottery classes as a way to explore my own creativity. I was really excited about it and started posting photos of my finished pieces on social media. I’ve been having a lot of fun, even though my skills are still very much in the beginner stage. Sarah has a background in fine arts, and I wanted her opinion on my work, so I shared a couple of my pieces with her.

To my surprise, Sarah was less than enthusiastic. She told me that pottery was ""easy"" and that I was being ""naive"" if I thought my pieces were anything special. I felt really hurt by her comments, especially since I was just trying to share something I was passionate about. I tried to brush it off, but it still bothered me.

A few weeks later, I attended one of Sarah’s art shows and saw her work, which was beautiful but also very similar to some styles that are currently trending. Afterward, I jokingly mentioned that she was riding the coattails of a trend to her face, trying to lighten the mood. She didn’t take it well and snapped at me, saying I wasn’t in a position to judge her work since I was just a beginner.

Things escalated quickly, and we ended up in a heated argument, both airing out grievances. I told her that she lacked respect for my efforts and that she should be more supportive of her friends. She countered that I was condescending about her art, claiming she was only successful because of her talent, while I was just playing around with clay. 

After this blow-up, we both ended up unfollowing each other on social media and haven’t spoken much since.

One afternoon, I was at a park with my daughter when I noticed a group of teenagers, maybe around 16 or 17, gathered near a playground. They were playing with a drone, and while it was pretty cool to see, it quickly became concerning. They were flying it dangerously close to the kids playing on the swings and slides, and I could see that a couple of younger kids were getting scared as the drone buzzed overhead.

After watching for a few minutes, I approached the group. I tried to be friendly, saying, “Hey guys, that’s a really cool drone! Just a heads up, though, it looks like you’re flying it a bit close to the kids. You wouldn’t want to accidentally hit someone, right?” 

At first, they looked at me like I was a bit odd for even talking to them. One of them, a boy with a sarcastic grin, said, “Relax, it’s fine. We know what we’re doing.” I felt a bit dismissed but pressed on, explaining that some of the little ones might not understand what was happening and could get hurt.

This led to an argument. They started mocking me, saying I was “overreacting” and that I should “chill out.” I got a bit defensive, feeling my protectiveness for the kids around us was justified. I raised my voice slightly, saying, “It’s not about you knowing what you’re doing; it’s about the safety of the younger kids here!”

The situation escalated until one of the girls in the group shouted, “Who even asked you? Go away!” At that point, I was embarrassed and frustrated, so I just walked away.

I felt a bit defensive and pointed out that not everyone has the luxury to just drop everything and travel.

My roommate, on the other hand, has a strict ""everything has to be in its place"" policy. He has a habit of rearranging things in the apartment when I'm not around and even leaves passive-aggressive notes if he finds something out of order.

Last week, I was particularly stressed with work and accidentally left my shoes in the living room overnight. The next morning, I found a note taped to the front door saying, ""Please be respectful and keep shared spaces tidy."" I snapped. I wrote back, “Maybe try not to be so uptight? It’s just shoes.”

This escalated into a back-and-forth where I ended up mocking his obsession by labeling all my items with sticky notes. I wrote things like “Not a hazard” and “Still functional!” and plastered them on items that he usually complains about. He got furious and confronted me about it, saying I was being childish and that I needed to grow up. I told him that he was overreacting and that it wasn’t that big of a deal.

In retrospect, we both could have handled the situation better. He should have addressed his concerns more directly instead of leaving notes, and I shouldn’t have stooped to mocking him. So, are we both the assholes here?",808,2731,0.68,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_24284,2020-02-02 00:00:00,ESH,1534,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, a few weeks ago, I was hanging out with my friend group, which includes my best friend, Sarah, and her boyfriend, Mike. They often argue, but usually it’s just playful banter. This time, though, it escalated into a full-blown fight at a gathering at my place.

We were all playing board games and having a good time until Mike made a joke about Sarah's cooking, which she took the wrong way. She got really upset and started yelling at him, and he was just trying to defend himself. I tried to step in and diffuse the situation by making a joke, but it fell flat and only made things worse. Sarah shot back at me, saying I was sticking up for “the enemy,” which hurt my feelings. 

In the heat of the moment, I snapped and told Sarah she was overreacting and that she needed to chill out. She started crying, and Mike, feeling defensive, said that I should have backed her up instead of attacking her. It turned into this awkward situation where everyone was uncomfortable, and the mood completely shifted.

After that, both Sarah and Mike left early, and I felt terrible. I texted them later to apologize for my comment and to say that I didn’t mean to add fuel to the fire. They replied that they appreciated the apology but were still upset with me for not being more supportive of Sarah during the argument.

Now, I feel like I messed up by not handling the situation better, but at the same time, I think they both overreacted too. I’m not sure if I’m in the wrong here or if it’s just one of those situations where everyone contributed to the fallout.

Everyone sucks here,"I work as a freelance graphic designer, and I recently took on a project for a friend of mine who runs a small bakery. She needed a new logo and some promotional materials for an upcoming event, and since we’re friends, I agreed to help her out at a discounted rate.

I spent a good amount of time working on her designs, putting in extra effort because I wanted to make her business stand out. I even went above and beyond by creating multiple concepts and iterations based on her feedback. After several drafts, she finally chose a design she loved, and we agreed on a price that reflected the discount for our friendship.

However, when I sent her the final files, she came back with a long list of changes she wanted. Most of the changes were minor, but some were pretty significant and would require a lot more work. I mentioned to her that since the project had already taken a lot of my time, I would have to charge her for the additional revisions.

She got upset and accused me of being unprofessional and greedy, saying that I should just do it for free since we’re friends. This really frustrated me because I felt like I was being taken advantage of after already giving her a discount. I tried to explain my perspective, but instead, we ended up in a heated argument where we both said things we didn’t mean.

Afterward, I felt guilty for how the conversation went. I could have handled it better, but I also feel like she overstepped by expecting me to do more work without proper compensation.

It’s hard for me to concentrate.” 

The mother looked at me, visibly upset, and replied, “We’re doing our best, but babies cry sometimes! It’s not like we can just make them stop.” I could feel other patrons staring, so I felt the need to defend myself and said, “Well, maybe you should have thought about that before coming into a quiet place like this.” 

The father chimed in, “You know, people have a right to be here with their kids, too. It’s not a library.” I snapped back, “Yeah, but there’s a difference between bringing a kid in and letting them scream the whole time!” 

The situation escalated a bit, and I ended up walking away, feeling frustrated. I couldn't believe they didn't even try to step outside to quiet the baby.

Everyone sucks here,"My partner Alex and I have been in a committed relationship for three years. We both have our own set of friends, but we often hang out together with a close-knit group of mutual friends. One of these mutual friends is Jamie, a charismatic and outgoing person who has always been a bit flirty, but I never thought much of it. 

Recently, Alex and I started having more serious conversations about our future. This led to me feeling a bit insecure, as I wasn't entirely sure where we stood. One weekend, we were all at a gathering at Jamie's place, and after a few drinks, I noticed Jamie being unusually flirtatious with Alex. They were laughing, sharing inside jokes, and at one point, Jamie playfully touched Alex's arm while making a joke. I felt a surge of jealousy but tried to brush it off.

Later that evening, I pulled Alex aside and expressed how uncomfortable I felt with Jamie's behavior. Instead of being supportive, Alex laughed it off, saying I was being overly sensitive and that Jamie was just being friendly. This frustrated me, as it felt like my feelings weren't being taken seriously.

The tension came to a head when Jamie overheard our conversation and decided to confront me about it, saying I was being ridiculous for not trusting Alex. In that moment, I snapped and told Jamie that they were being inappropriate and that they needed to back off. Jamie defended their actions, saying they were just being themselves and that I should lighten up. This turned into a heated argument, with Jamie calling me insecure while I accused them of disrespecting my relationship. 

The next day, I got a text from Alex saying that I had embarrassed them in front of our friends and that I should have handled it more maturely. They also said that Jamie felt hurt by my comments and that I needed to apologize. Instead of feeling remorseful, I felt justified in standing up for myself. 

Now, both Alex and Jamie are upset with me, and our friends are caught in the middle. I understand that I may have overreacted, but I also felt it was necessary to voice my discomfort.

Everyone sucks here,"My friend and I decided to go out for dinner last week since we both had a stressful week at work. We were really looking forward to catching up and enjoying some good food. When we got to the restaurant, I suggested we order a bunch of appetizers to share, which he seemed excited about. I’ve always loved sharing food, and I thought it would be a fun way to enjoy our meal together.

However, when the waiter came to take our order, my friend suddenly changed his mind and decided he wanted to order a full meal for himself instead. I tried to convince him to stick with the appetizers, mentioning that we could each get a meal afterwards if we were still hungry. He got a bit defensive and said he wasn't in the mood to share food and that he wanted to enjoy something he really liked.

Feeling frustrated, I snapped back that it was supposed to be a fun dinner and not just about him. He shot back that I was being selfish for insisting on sharing when he had different preferences. This back-and-forth escalated quickly, and we ended up arguing loudly in the restaurant, drawing attention from other diners.

After a heated exchange, we both fell silent, and the atmosphere between us was tense. I ended up ordering the appetizers anyway, feeling hurt that he didn't want to share this experience with me, and he ordered his meal without acknowledging my choice.

By the end of the night, we both left feeling awkward and upset. I felt bad for pushing my idea too hard, but also frustrated that he didn't seem to care about the shared experience. In retrospect, I realize we both could have approached the situation more calmly.

Everyone sucks here,"This happened a few months ago, and I’ve been wrestling with whether I handled things poorly. Names have been changed for privacy.

Background: I (28F) work in a small office with my coworker, Tom (30M). We’ve always gotten along pretty well, but we’re very different people. Tom is known for being a bit of a jokester, often crossing the line with his humor, while I tend to be more serious and straightforward. 

A few weeks ago, our boss sent out an email announcing a team-building event. It was a fun day planned at a local amusement park, and I was genuinely excited. However, I was also a little anxious because I knew that it would be hard for me to relax with Tom around. He has a habit of making inappropriate jokes, especially around sensitive topics, and I worried he might ruin the day for everyone.

When the day came, we all met up at the amusement park. As expected, Tom started with his usual banter. At one point, he made a joke about an accident that happened to a coworker a few months prior. It was in poor taste, and I could see that a couple of our colleagues were uncomfortable. I decided to speak up. I turned to Tom and said, “You know, not everyone finds that funny. Maybe you should think before you joke about serious things.” 

It got awkward quickly. He responded defensively, saying I was being too sensitive and ruining the fun. I could feel the tension in the air, and a few people seemed to side with him. I thought I was standing up for our coworker and trying to maintain a positive atmosphere, but I ended up making the day uncomfortable for everyone. 

Later, during lunch, I overheard some coworkers talking about how I “ruined” the mood and how Tom was just trying to lighten things up. I felt guilty for calling him out, but I also believed it was important to address inappropriate behavior. 

After the event, Tom confronted me, saying I embarrassed him in front of everyone and that I should have let him be himself. I tried to explain that I just wanted to create a respectful environment, but he was hurt and said I should “chill out.” 

Now I’m left wondering if I overstepped by calling him out publicly, or if he was being inconsiderate by making those jokes in the first place.

Recently, she started dating Mike, a guy from her work. They’ve been together for about two months, and while I've met him a few times, I wouldn't say I know him very well.

A few weeks ago, Jessica and Mike were throwing a small party at their place to celebrate their new relationship. A group of friends was invited, and I was excited to go. During the party, Mike and I ended up in the kitchen chatting while Jessica was busy with some of our mutual friends in the living room. We started talking about music, and it turned out we both share a love for classic rock. He mentioned that he plays guitar and offered to show me a few riffs, which I thought was really cool.

After a few drinks, things got a little more relaxed, and we ended up jamming together in the living room. Jessica joined in, and we had a great time playing a couple of songs. It was all in good fun, and I thought it brought the group closer together.

However, things took a turn when Jessica started getting frustrated. After a while, she pulled me aside and accused me of trying to ""steal"" Mike from her. I was taken aback because I never intended for it to come off that way; I was just having fun with a friend. I tried to explain that we were just jamming and that it wasn't anything serious, but she wouldn’t listen and got increasingly upset.

Things escalated when she started making comments in front of everyone, implying that I was too friendly with Mike and that I needed to back off. The vibe of the party shifted, and I felt embarrassed. I shot back, saying she was being overly possessive and should trust her boyfriend. That only made her angrier, and she ended up storming out of the party, taking Mike with her.

Leading up to the party, I noticed that my partner and their daughter were both getting increasingly stressed out about the planning and the decorations. They wanted everything to be perfect, and I could see that it was causing a lot of tension. I tried to help out by suggesting some ideas and offering to handle certain tasks, but it always seemed to add to the stress instead of relieving it. Eventually, I felt like I was being pushed aside and my opinions didn’t matter.

When I returned, I found the house in chaos with decorations half-hung and the party guests arriving soon. I tried to pitch in and help, but my partner snapped at me, saying it was too late for my input and to just stay out of the way. Frustrated, I ended up arguing with them about how I was trying to help and felt unappreciated.

Instead of taking my advice, she got defensive and accused me of being judgmental. I told her I was just looking out for her and that she should really think about what she was doing.

Feeling frustrated, I went to Mark and told him about the flirting. I thought it would help him understand that Jess wasn’t being honest with him. He was devastated and confronted Jess. She was furious with me for telling him and accused me of breaking her trust.

Jake is very into fitness and is always talking about his workouts, diets, and protein shakes. I’m not really into that stuff—I prefer video games and watching movies.

Recently, I got a little frustrated with Jake because he keeps leaving his workout equipment all over the living room. I asked him if he could keep his weights and resistance bands in his room since I don't want to trip over them while I'm trying to relax. He seemed really offended and accused me of not supporting his fitness goals. I tried to explain that it’s not about him being fit; I just want a tidy space.

Things escalated when I jokingly said he should stop being such a “gym bro” and maybe take a day off to play video games with me instead. He didn’t find it funny at all and snapped back about how lazy I am. So, out of frustration, I decided to ""return the favor"" and left my video game controllers and snacks all over the kitchen counter, which is his space for meal prep.

I felt humiliated, especially since I take pride in my work and know how important it is.

After a few jabs, I snapped and said, “At least I’m not pretending to be the next big YouTuber while living in Mom’s basement.” I thought it was a pretty clever comeback, but it led to a huge argument. My brother got really upset and stormed off, and the family was split on who was in the wrong. Some think I overreacted, and others feel he deserved it for being a jerk.

Everyone sucks here,"My friend group has been close for years, and we often organize get-togethers, game nights, and outings. Recently, we decided to plan a weekend trip to a cabin in the woods to unwind and have some fun. Everyone was excited and contributed to the planning, including splitting costs for the cabin, food, and activities.

A week before the trip, we learned that one of our friends, Alex, wouldn't be able to join us due to a last-minute work commitment. We were all disappointed but understood that work can be unpredictable. However, Alex still wanted to be part of the planning and suggested that we video call him during some activities so he could feel included. 

I thought it was a great idea, but as the trip drew closer, I started to feel frustrated. I realized that Alex wanted us to treat him as if he were there in person, but I felt like it might detract from our experience. I was concerned that we would be too focused on including him rather than enjoying our time together. 

When we got to the cabin, I made the decision to limit our video calls with Alex, thinking it might be better for everyone to just enjoy the moment without worrying about how he was feeling. I ended up only doing one quick call during dinner and avoided any other attempts to include him in real-time.

To make matters worse, during the trip, I started venting to another friend, Sarah, about how I felt Alex was being selfish for wanting so much attention when he chose not to come. I didn't mean for it to get back to Alex, but it did. 

Once he found out, Alex was really hurt. He felt excluded and thought it was unfair that we didn't try harder to include him. Sarah confronted me about what I said, saying I was being insensitive. I felt justified in wanting to focus on our experience but also recognized that I didn't handle the situation well.

Now, our group is tense, and Alex is upset with me in particular. I regret how I spoke about him, but I still believe I was right to prioritize the group experience.

So here’s the deal. I (29F) have a younger brother (25M) who just got engaged. We’ve always had a bit of sibling rivalry, but it’s never been too serious. I was excited for him and his fiancé (let’s call her Sarah) and wanted to help them with their wedding planning. My brother asked me to be his best woman, which I thought was sweet.

Last week, we were at a family gathering, and I jokingly mentioned how I thought Sarah's choice of wedding colors was a bit tacky. I really didn’t mean to offend anyone—just trying to lighten the mood with a little humor. But Sarah took it to heart and got visibly upset. My brother got defensive and told me it wasn’t cool to insult his fiancé, even in jest. I apologized, but it turned into a bigger argument.

In my attempt to defend myself, I ended up saying some pretty rude things about their relationship—like how I thought they were moving too fast and that maybe they weren’t ready for marriage. I didn’t mean it, but I was frustrated and my mouth just ran away with me. My brother was furious at me for putting down his fiancé, and Sarah started crying. 

Then, to make matters worse, I tried to lighten the situation again by suggesting we all go out for drinks to take the edge off. That did not land well. My brother stormed off with Sarah, and I was left standing there feeling like a complete jerk. 

After that, I felt guilty and tried to text my brother to apologize again, but he hasn’t responded.

A few weeks ago, I was at a friend’s birthday party. It was a pretty big gathering, and everyone was in a festive mood. As the night went on, a couple of my friends started playing a drinking game. I decided to join in for a few rounds, but I’m not much of a drinker, so I was pacing myself while others were going all out.

At some point, things started to get a bit rowdy, and one of my friends, let’s call her Sarah, was really drinking heavily. She’s a fun person, but when she gets drunk, she can be loud and a bit obnoxious. As the night went on, she started making fun of other people’s drinking abilities and even poked fun at a couple of guests about their weight. It was uncomfortable, and I could see some people getting visibly upset.

Feeling the tension, I decided to speak up. I told her that it wasn’t cool to make fun of others, especially when people are just trying to have a good time. I thought I was being a good friend by standing up for those who were uncomfortable. Unfortunately, Sarah didn’t take it well. She snapped back, saying I was being a buzzkill and that I was overly sensitive. I tried to explain my point further, but she just kept getting louder and more defensive. 

At that point, I got frustrated and called her a “drama queen” and told her to grow up. It was a pretty harsh thing to say, and it escalated into an argument. Other guests started to weigh in, and it became a whole thing where people were taking sides. It turned into a mess, and the vibe of the party completely shifted.

Eventually, Sarah left in tears, and I felt bad for how it all went down. I apologized to her later via text, but things are still a bit awkward between us. I feel like I was right to call her out for her behavior, but I also regret how I handled it and the name-calling.

However, things started to go downhill when I began dating someone she didn't approve of. She expressed her concerns, but I felt that she was being controlling and judgmental. I ended up distancing myself from her, thinking that I had to choose between my friendship and my new relationship.

In the heat of the moment, I shared some private conversations we had about her insecurities with my partner, thinking it would help him understand why I felt the way I did about her. This led to a huge rift between us, and she found out I had shared those conversations. She was devastated and felt betrayed, and we ended up not speaking for months.

During that time, I turned to other friends who encouraged me to move on from her and focus on my new relationship. I became increasingly distant and eventually unfollowed her on social media. Just recently, she reached out to me, wanting to discuss everything and try to mend our friendship. Instead of being open to talking, I shot her down and told her that I was happy without her in my life, which I now realize was pretty harsh.

Last week, I went over to Emily's place to hang out. I brought some takeout, and we were having a good time catching up. Jake was there too, and he started talking about how he wants to start a YouTube channel focused on gaming. Emily and I both thought it was a fun idea and encouraged him to go for it.

As the night went on, we started joking about what it means to be a ""professional gamer."" In the spirit of fun, I mentioned that he should probably get serious about it if he wants to monetize it, like being consistent and not just playing all day without any strategy. I was trying to give him some constructive criticism, but it came off more like a lecture.

Then Jake, feeling defensive, said, “At least I’m trying to do something with my life instead of just sitting in an office all day.” I snapped back, “Excuse me? I work hard at my job to support myself. Not everyone can just dive into their hobbies without consequences.” 

The argument escalated, and Emily tried to mediate, but it turned into a shouting match. Eventually, Jake stormed out, and Emily was furious with both of us for ruining the night.

I have a group of friends that I hang out with regularly, and we all love to play video games together. Recently, we decided to start a new campaign in a popular RPG. I took on the role of the Dungeon Master (DM) since I’ve done it a few times before and enjoy the storytelling aspect of the game.

One of my friends, Jake, is usually pretty laid back and easygoing. However, during our first session, I noticed he was being unusually critical about my choices as a DM. He would interrupt me frequently to suggest different directions for the story, often dismissing my ideas outright. I tried to incorporate some of his suggestions, but it quickly became clear that he was not just trying to be collaborative; he wanted to take control of the game.

I found myself getting frustrated, and I snapped at him during one session, telling him that if he wanted to run the game, he could do it himself. This led to an awkward silence, and Jake looked hurt. He later told me that he didn’t mean to offend me and just wanted to contribute more to the game. I felt bad for how I reacted, but I was also feeling overwhelmed by his constant interruptions.

After that session, I ended up venting to another friend, Lisa, about the situation. I may have exaggerated a bit, saying that Jake was ruining the fun for everyone. Lisa, in turn, mentioned it to Jake, which led to a confrontation. Jake felt betrayed that I talked about him behind his back, and he accused me of being a poor DM for not being able to handle feedback. 

Now, the whole group is caught in the middle, and some of our friends feel uncomfortable about choosing sides. I thought I was justified in my frustration, but I'm starting to wonder if I overreacted and if I should have handled the situation differently.

As the wedding approached, my brother and his fiancée decided they wanted a small, intimate ceremony with close family and friends.

I thought it could foster a good atmosphere, especially since our family has had its share of issues in the past.

A bit of backstory: I’m in my late 20s, and for the past few years, I’ve always celebrated my birthday with a small gathering at my place, inviting close friends and having a chill night with good food, drinks, and games. It’s been something I really look forward to every year.

This year, however, my best friend (let’s call her Sarah) has been planning a big party for her own birthday, which is just a week before mine. She’s really excited about it, and I completely get that. She’s been putting a lot of effort into organizing it, and I want to support her, but the way she’s been pushing for everyone to join her celebration is starting to get to me.

Sarah has been vocal about wanting to keep her party exclusive to a certain group of friends, and she’s explicitly mentioned that she doesn’t want anyone splitting their attention between her party and mine. She basically told me that if I want to have my own celebration, I should just do something small with a few people and not expect everyone to attend both of our events.

I felt kind of hurt by her comments because I’ve always valued my birthday as a time to bring friends together and celebrate. So, I told her that I really want to have my usual gathering this year because that’s what I love, and I don’t want to downplay my birthday just because she feels a certain way about it. 

Now, she’s upset and feels like I’m trying to overshadow her big day. I didn’t mean for it to come across that way, and I really do want her to have a great birthday. But now I’m feeling guilty that my desire to celebrate my birthday in my way is causing tension between us.

I woke up early, made breakfast for all of us, and tried to keep the mood light. However, when I suggested we have a quieter day so I could study, Jake laughed it off and said I was overreacting. That really annoyed me.

I snapped and told him that if he didn’t want to leave, he could at least be quieter and let me focus. Jake got defensive and said he was just trying to have a good time, and my boyfriend jumped in to defend him.

In the heat of the moment, I told him that he was a disappointment and that I didn’t want to have any part in cleaning up after his mess. I hung up on him, feeling guilty but also justified in my anger. 

A few hours later, I decided to check in and see how the party was going, and I saw that he had posted a ton of pictures on social media. It looked like everyone was having a great time, but I felt a mix of resentment and worry about what the house would look like afterward. I sent him a message asking him to at least keep things under control, but he just ignored me.

The next day, I woke up to a barrage of texts from friends and family who had seen the party pictures and were either laughing about it or expressing concern. I realized I was being overly critical and maybe even a bit hypocritical since I had thrown parties in the past without my parents' knowledge too. I decided to go over to help him clean up before our parents got back, but when I arrived, I found him and his friends still partying, and I lost it again. 

I ended up screaming at him in front of everyone about being irresponsible and how he needed to grow up. He yelled back that I was being a buzzkill and that we were having fun. It turned into a shouting match in the middle of his party, and it was awkward for everyone involved. I stormed out, feeling both angry and ashamed of how things escalated.

Now I feel like a jerk for ruining his fun, but I think he should have taken my concerns seriously. I just wanted him to act like an adult. AITA?",89,901,0.51,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_64049,2020-09-26 00:00:00,ESH,2676,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I'm part of a family that has always had a competitive streak, especially when it comes to achievements. Growing up, my older sister, Sarah, was the star. She was the one who always excelled in everything—academics, sports, you name it. I was more laid-back and didn't feel the need to compete, but my parents often compared us, which created a strain in our relationship.

Recently, Sarah got a promotion at her job that she was really proud of. She called me to share the news, and I was genuinely happy for her, but her tone felt a little condescending. She started bragging about how much she was making now and how impressive her role was, and I could sense she was waiting for me to be envious or something.

To lighten the mood, I made a joke about how I might need to start charging her for my advice since she was doing so well. Instead of laughing it off, she took it personally and snapped back, saying something like, ""You wouldn't have to worry about that if you actually did something with your life."" 

Now, that really rubbed me the wrong way. I told her, ""Well, at least I have a life outside of work. Not everyone needs a title to feel validated."" I could hear her breathing heavily on the other end, and then she hung up on me. 

Later, our parents called me, saying I should reach out and apologize for what I said. They felt that I was too harsh, but I felt like I was just standing up for myself after she insulted me first. Honestly, we both have a history of jabbing at each other, and while I didn't want to hurt her, I didn't feel like I was entirely in the wrong either.

Recently, my boyfriend planned a surprise birthday party for me and invited a bunch of our friends, including Jake. I didn’t know about the party until the day of, and I was really excited. When I arrived, everyone was there, and it was lovely—except for Jake. He immediately started making comments about how I should have worn something more “flattering” and how I was lucky my boyfriend was so “tolerant” of me.

Mark and I have been friends for over a decade, and I was honored to be asked to assist him on such a big occasion. He explained that he was on a tight budget and could really use my organizational skills to help manage the details.

I jumped in, excited to help out. We decided to meet weekly to go over the checklist of things that needed to be done. At our first meeting, we laid out a plan, and I got to work on some of the vendor research and coordination.

However, as the weeks went by, I started to notice that Mark was becoming increasingly disorganized and indecisive. He would often change his mind about the venue, flower arrangements, and even the guest list at the last minute. This led to numerous stressful conversations where I tried to help him stick to a plan and make final decisions.

One day, I suggested we meet to finalize the seating chart, which had been a source of frustration for both of us. Mark agreed but then canceled last minute, saying he was too busy. This happened multiple times. I became frustrated because I felt like I was putting in all this effort, and he wasn’t meeting me halfway.

Eventually, I reached my breaking point. I sent him a long message expressing my frustration, telling him that if he wasn't going to take this seriously, I was going to step back from helping. I felt it was unfair for me to be doing all the work while he kept delaying decisions.

Mark responded with hurt feelings, saying he thought I was there to support him and that my message felt more like an attack than encouragement. I realized I had been too harsh and apologized, but I also felt like he needed a wake-up call.

Last week, after seeing a pile of dirty dishes accumulate, I decided to bring it up. I expressed my feelings and mentioned how it makes me stressed to work in a messy environment.

So, I work in a small office with about ten people, and we try to keep things light-hearted. Recently, one of my coworkers, Sarah, had a birthday, and we decided to throw her a surprise party. I was tasked with organizing it, and I was really excited to make it special for her.

On the day of the party, I bought a cake and decorations, and I brought in a funny birthday card that had a joke about getting older. However, I got there early and accidentally saw Sarah’s desk. She had a picture of her late mother who had passed away a few months prior, and it made me uncomfortable. I thought maybe the joke might hit a little too close to home since I knew she had been struggling with the loss.

When Sarah arrived, everyone was shouting “Surprise!” and she was genuinely thrilled. But when I handed her the card, I panicked a bit and said, “Oh, I hope you don’t think this is too mean; I just thought it was funny!” 

Sarah's face changed immediately, and she said she didn’t find it funny at all given her situation. I felt awful, but instead of apologizing right away, I got defensive and said, “Well, it was meant to be light-hearted! You should be able to take a joke.” 

This led to a tense argument where Sarah said I was insensitive, and I shot back that she was being overly sensitive about a joke that wasn’t even that bad. The rest of our coworkers started to feel awkward, and a few sided with Sarah, saying I should have been more thoughtful.

Eventually, I apologized, but the damage was done. Both Sarah and I ended up feeling hurt, and the atmosphere at work was pretty tense for a week afterward.

Recently, one of my friends, Jake (26M), started dating a girl named Sarah (24F) who none of us knew very well. While we all welcomed her into the group, I found her to be a bit self-absorbed and inconsiderate. 

One weekend, we all went out to dinner to celebrate Jake's birthday. Sarah insisted on choosing the restaurant, which turned out to be a place that was outside our budget. I didn't want to create any awkwardness, so I went along with it, but I felt uncomfortable for everyone else. When the bill came, Sarah ordered more than anyone else and suggested we split it evenly. I knew that I had ordered something much cheaper, and so did everyone else.

After a bit of back-and-forth, I spoke up and said, “I’m not okay with splitting the bill evenly when some of us ordered much less.” The atmosphere got really tense. Jake looked embarrassed, and Sarah rolled her eyes at me, claiming I was being petty. The rest of the group kind of looked at each other awkwardly, not knowing what to say.

Later, in our group chat, Sarah accused me of ruining Jake's birthday celebration, which led to a heated argument. I stood my ground and said that I was just trying to be fair, but I also admitted that I felt frustrated with her attitude overall, which I realized might have been too harsh. 

Eventually, Jake told me I should apologize to Sarah, which I reluctantly did. But then, in a moment of retaliation, I mentioned that maybe if she had a better sense of how to treat people, she wouldn’t have to rely on other people’s kindness to get her way.

While I understand that life can be busy, I feel like we’re wasting a lot of money that we could be saving for future plans, like traveling or buying a house.

I brought this up with my partner during a calm conversation, suggesting that we could save money if we cooked more meals at home together. My partner, however, became defensive and said that cooking takes too much time and they enjoy the convenience of takeout. I tried to explain how we could meal prep or cook together on weekends, but they just brushed me off, saying they didn’t want to deal with that.

Hey everyone, I’m in a bit of a bind and could use some perspectives on this. My daughter just turned 7, and I organized a birthday party for her at a local park. I went all out with decorations, games, and goodie bags, excited to make it a special day for her and her friends. I specifically wanted it to be a more controlled environment for the kids to enjoy themselves safely, which is why I sent out invitations only to the kids in her class.

My sister has two kids, ages 5 and 8, who I love dearly, but they can be a bit unruly. I didn’t invite them because I wanted to keep the party focused on my daughter’s friends. Well, my sister decided to bring her kids anyway without telling me. At first, I was fine with it, thinking they could blend in, but it quickly became chaotic when her kids started running around, yelling, and disrupting the games I had planned. 

I asked my sister a couple of times to help rein them in, but she either ignored me or laughed it off, saying they were just having fun. I ended up getting frustrated and told her that I needed her to actually supervise them, as it was my daughter’s party and I didn’t want it turning into a free-for-all. That didn’t go over well. My sister snapped back, saying I was being controlling and that kids should be allowed to be kids, and that I should just let loose and enjoy the chaos.

We were excited because we love board games and it's been a while since we hung out with them. However, I noticed that our friends tend to be a bit competitive during games, which sometimes leads to tension and arguments.

Before the game night, I suggested to my partner that we should bring a snack or two to share. We both love cooking, so we decided to make homemade nachos and guacamole. I figured it would be a hit since it's a group favorite. On the day of the event, we prepped everything and brought it over, excited to share.

Once we arrived, I noticed that our friends had prepared a huge amount of food, including a bunch of store-bought snacks and a fancy cheese platter. I felt a little embarrassed about our simple nachos compared to their spread, but I shrugged it off and set our dish on the table.

As the night went on, we started playing a new game that none of us had played before. I was a bit nervous because I didn't want to ruin the fun, but I tried to keep things light. However, during the game, I made a few mistakes, which my friends pointed out in a joking but slightly harsh manner. I laughed along, but it started to feel a bit uncomfortable.

At one point, I accidentally knocked over a drink while trying to take my turn, and it spilled on their carpet. I immediately apologized and offered to clean it up. Instead of accepting my apology, one of my friends made a big deal out of it, saying that it was ruining the night and that I should be more careful.

I tried to ignore it, but it got louder and louder, and I could hear the bass thumping through my walls. I went out onto my balcony to see if I could talk to them, but the noise was so overwhelming that I had to yell to be heard.

I knocked on their door and once they answered, I politely asked if they could turn the music down since it was really loud. They laughed it off and told me to “lighten up, it’s just a party!” This was frustrating, but I just went back to my apartment and tried to drown it out with my own music.

After a few more hours of noise, I decided I’d had enough. I grabbed a bunch of pots and pans from my kitchen and went back to their door. I started banging them together as loudly as I could, yelling for them to turn down the music. It worked; they immediately quieted down and came outside to yell at me. 

We ended up in a heated argument where they called me a “party pooper” and I told them they were inconsiderate. I felt guilty afterward for escalating the situation, but I was just so fed up.

But as the night went on, one of my friends, let's call her Sarah, started to get a bit too tipsy. She was loud, making jokes that were somewhat inappropriate, and generally drawing attention to our table.

At one point, she made a joke about another friend's outfit that definitely crossed a line. It upset our friend, and I could see she was trying to brush it off, but I could tell Sarah wasn't getting the hint. I decided to step in, trying to lighten the mood, and I playfully said, ""Come on, Sarah, could you not be so embarrassing? You're going to make us all look bad.""

Instead of taking it lightly, Sarah got defensive and shot back, ""Well, it’s not my fault you all are so uptight!"" This made things worse, and the atmosphere shifted. I could feel the tension at our table, and I realized I might have made it worse by calling her out in front of everyone.

After that, Sarah ended up storming off to the restroom, and a few friends were annoyed with me for saying anything at all. They thought I should have just let her have her fun, even if it was over the top. I felt bad, but I didn't want her to ruin the celebration for everyone.

When Sarah came back, she was still upset, and things felt awkward for the rest of the night. I thought I was trying to help by addressing her behavior, but now I’m not so sure.

So, AITA for calling out my friend for being embarrassing at a birthday dinner, or should I have just let it go and dealt with the fallout later?",425,1454,0.59,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_11518,2021-07-19 00:00:00,ESH,1715,AITA

I'm 28m and my partner is 27f. 

A few weeks ago, we were invited to a friend's wedding that I was really looking forward to. I asked my partner if she wanted to go with me, and she said she didn't feel like it, citing that she wasn't in the mood for socializing. I told her I understood but expressed how much I wanted her to come since it was a close friend of mine.

She eventually agreed, but the day of the wedding, she seemed off. She was quiet during the ceremony and didn’t engage much during the reception. I tried to include her in conversations, but she just didn’t seem interested. I was getting frustrated because I felt like I was missing out on enjoying the moment with my friends because she wasn't having a good time.

After a couple of hours, I suggested we step outside for some fresh air, hoping it would help her mood. Instead, she snapped at me, saying I was being too pushy and that she should be allowed to feel how she feels without me trying to fix it. I got upset and told her that I was just trying to have a good time together and that I didn’t appreciate her dragging me down.

We ended up having an argument right there outside the venue, and I raised my voice a bit, which drew some attention from other guests. It was embarrassing for both of us. After that, she decided she wanted to leave, and I didn’t argue because I was still frustrated. I ended up staying at the wedding and seeing my friends without her.

The next day, she was hurt and said I embarrassed her in front of my friends and that I should have been more understanding. I felt hurt too, as I thought I was trying to help her enjoy the occasion.

Everyone sucks here,"Last month, my best friend had a big birthday party to celebrate her 30th. She decided to host it at a local bar and invited a large group of friends, including some of our mutual friends who have a history of being a bit wild when they drink. 

I was excited to celebrate with her but I was also a bit apprehensive because I knew that one of the friends she invited, let's call him Mark, tends to get really obnoxious and sometimes out of control after a few drinks. He’s made some comments in the past that made me uncomfortable, especially when he’s had a few too many, and I didn’t want to deal with that at her party.

As the day approached, I decided to reach out to my friend to express my concerns. I told her that I was a little worried about Mark being at the party and how he can be when he drinks. I suggested that maybe she could talk to him or even consider not inviting him since I really wanted to enjoy the night without the potential for drama.

She was upset with me for saying anything. She said that it was her party and she wanted everyone there, including Mark. She felt that I was trying to dictate who she could and couldn’t invite, and that it was unfair of me to put that pressure on her.

I got defensive and argued that I just wanted her to have a good time without any issues. Then I mentioned that I might not come if he was going to be there. In hindsight, I realize that it was a bit dramatic and probably not the best way to handle it. 

After our conversation, she decided to keep Mark on the guest list, and I ended up feeling really hurt and left out. The night of the party, I went but the entire time I felt on edge, worried that Mark would make a scene. He did end up getting pretty intoxicated and made a few inappropriate jokes that made a lot of people uncomfortable, myself included.

Afterwards, I told my friend about my experience and how I felt about Mark’s behavior. She was upset again, saying I should have just enjoyed the party instead of focusing on him. I told her that I was trying to look out for her, but I also realized that my approach could have been better.

Now I feel bad because I think I shouldn’t have expressed my concerns in such a direct way, and she shouldn't have felt pressured by me. We’re both hurt by how things unfolded, and I wonder if I overstepped by bringing it up in the first place. Am I the asshole for speaking up about my feelings regarding her guest list?

Everyone sucks here,"My roommate and I have been living together for about a year, and while we mostly get along, there’s been a growing issue over how we manage our shared space. My roommate is a huge fan of cooking elaborate meals, which I can appreciate, but they also leave a lot of mess behind. The kitchen often ends up looking like a bomb went off with dishes piled up, food splatters everywhere, and the trash overflowing.

I’ve tried to be patient and have talked to them about it, suggesting that we set aside specific cleaning days, but they always brush it off, saying they’ll clean it later. However, “later” rarely comes. I’m someone who likes a clean space, and it’s been hard to focus on my work when I can’t even find a clean plate.

This week, I finally snapped. After coming home to a kitchen that looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in days, I started loudly complaining about how disgusting it was and how I couldn’t live like this anymore. I told my roommate that I was tired of their mess and that they needed to step up and take responsibility. I might have raised my voice a bit, which I realize was probably unnecessary.

My roommate got really defensive and said that they felt unappreciated for the effort they put into cooking and that I was being overly dramatic. They said they were just going to stop cooking altogether if it bothered me so much. I felt bad for escalating things, but I was also frustrated because I felt like I wasn't being heard. 

We ended up having a heated argument, and it resulted in both of us feeling upset and resentful.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I (28M) have a younger brother (24M) who’s always been the classic “life of the party” type. He loves to joke around and can be pretty outrageous, which has always been his charm. However, lately, I’ve noticed that his jokes have crossed a line, especially when it comes to my girlfriend (27F), who’s been struggling with her mental health.

My girlfriend has been open about her anxiety and depression, and while my brother used to be supportive, I think he’s become too comfortable joking about it. A few weeks ago, we were at a family gathering, and he made a joke about her needing to “lighten up” and suggested that she should just “take a chill pill.” It was loud enough for everyone to hear, and I could see my girlfriend’s face drop. She tried to laugh it off, but I could tell it really stung.

I confronted him about it later, and instead of apologizing, he brushed it off and said I was being too sensitive. I lost my temper and yelled at him, telling him that he’s a jerk for making fun of someone’s struggles. He got defensive and said I was ruining the fun and that it was just a joke. I ended up saying some pretty harsh things, including that he’ll never understand what it’s like to face real problems.

Things escalated after that. He told our parents what happened, and they called me to say I overreacted and should apologize to him. I felt conflicting emotions, so I did apologize for yelling, but I also stood by my point that he needs to be more considerate. In response, he called me a buzzkill and said I was just enabling my girlfriend’s “victim mentality.”

Now, I’m feeling guilty because I know I could have handled it better, but I also think he needs to understand the impact of his words. My girlfriend isn’t talking to my brother, and it’s caused some tension in the family. So, am I the asshole here?",865,2555,0.85,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_12719,2019-09-21 00:00:00,ESH,1838,AITA

He frequently makes sarcastic comments about her friends, including me, and it really bothers me. I’ve tried to be polite and keep my opinions to myself, but it’s hard to watch her be treated that way.

During a recent dinner, he made a particularly rude comment about my career and how I should “get a real job” instead of my freelance work. I snapped and told him that maybe he should consider a class in manners instead of trying to insult people. My friend was shocked and defensive, telling me that I shouldn’t have said that and that I was overreacting.

After that, I felt guilty for escalating things, but I also think I was justified in standing up for myself. I texted my friend later to apologize for the harshness of my words but stood by the fact that I won’t let anyone talk down to me like that.

Now, my friend is upset with me and says I should have handled it more maturely, while I feel frustrated that she isn’t standing up for herself.

Everyone sucks here,"I need to share something that happened recently with my group of friends, and I really don't know if I handled it the right way.

So, I (28F) have a close-knit group of friends that I've known for years. In this group, there's one person, Jake (30M), who has always been a bit of an oddball. He has a tendency to dominate conversations and often makes jokes that don’t land well, which makes some of us uncomfortable. Despite that, he’s a genuinely good person, and I’ve always tried to be supportive of him.

Recently, we were all hanging out at a friend's house, and Jake started telling one of his infamous stories that usually goes on way too long. It was clear that most of us were losing interest, and I could see a couple of my friends exchanging looks of annoyance. Instead of gently steering the conversation elsewhere, I decided to make a joke at Jake's expense to lighten the mood. I said something like, “Wow, Jake, can you wrap that up in under ten minutes for once?” The laughter that followed made me feel validated in the moment, but I quickly noticed that Jake's expression fell. He brushed it off and tried to laugh with us, but I could tell it hurt him.

After that, the atmosphere shifted, and Jake seemed to withdraw. I felt bad but didn’t want to make a scene, so I shrugged it off and continued with the night. A few days later, I was talking to one of my friends, Sarah (27F), and she mentioned that Jake had been really down and felt like we didn’t appreciate him. I felt guilty, realizing that my comment might have contributed to how he felt.

I reached out to Jake to apologize, but he said he was fine and didn’t want to talk about it. I tried to explain that I didn't mean to hurt him and that I value our friendship, but he just said it was whatever. I later found out that some other friends in our group were also making fun of Jake behind his back, which made me even more upset.

So, now I’m feeling torn. I shouldn’t have made that joke, and I should have stood up for him instead of going along with the crowd. But I also feel frustrated that Jake always puts himself in these situations where he’s the butt of the joke. I don’t want to be the bad guy, but I also don’t know how to balance being honest about my feelings and supporting him.

Everyone sucks here,"Background:

My partner (Alex) and I have been together for three years. We both earn decent wages, but I make slightly more than Alex. When we moved in together, we decided to split all household expenses evenly, and whatever is left over from our paychecks goes into our own personal accounts for spending. I’m a pretty big saver, while Alex loves to spend on experiences, dining out, and the latest gadgets.

Current:

Last weekend, we went to a birthday party for one of Alex’s friends. During the party, Alex started talking about our finances with a group of friends. They asked how we manage our money, and Alex mentioned that I earn more and often put extra into savings while they spend on fun things. I felt uncomfortable with this discussion since I don’t like discussing finances in public, but I didn’t say anything at the time.

Later, one of Alex’s friends joked about how I must be the ""fun police"" in the relationship, and that Alex is stuck with a partner who prioritizes savings over live-it-up experiences. Alex laughed along but then said, “Well, at least I can indulge sometimes because I know my partner is responsible.” This comment didn’t sit well with me because I felt like it undermined my approach to finances. 

After the party, when we got home, I confronted Alex about discussing our finances so openly. I expressed that while I understand they didn’t mean any harm, I felt it was disrespectful to frame my saving habits in a negative light. Alex got defensive and said that I was overreacting and that they were just trying to convey that I care about our future. I pointed out that I do care, but I also care about my privacy and how we present our financial situation to others.

We ended up arguing about it for a while, and I said some things that were hurtful, implying that Alex was irresponsible with their money. Alex retaliated by saying I was controlling and treated them like a child. We both went to bed feeling upset, and I realized we both could have handled the situation better.

Here’s where things get complicated. My brother’s girlfriend has a son from a previous relationship. I’ve never met him, but my brother talks about him a lot and seems to really care for the kid. The thing is, my brother wants to adopt him after they get married, and he asked me to be supportive of that.

I think it’s great that he wants to be a father figure, but I have some reservations. I’m not sure how to put this delicately, but my brother has never really been great with kids. He gets frustrated easily and has a short temper, which worries me. I told him that maybe he should slow down and think about the responsibility of adopting a child, especially since he’s never had that experience before.

This turned into a big argument, and he accused me of not being supportive and trying to undermine his relationship. I, in turn, got upset because I feel like my concerns are valid.

Our parents had planned a surprise birthday party for my dad, and while everyone was excited, I wasn't feeling it. To be honest, I've been feeling overwhelmed with work and personal issues, and the idea of a big family get-together felt like too much.

When I told my brother I wouldn't be attending, he got upset, saying that family is important and I needed to be there for our dad. I expressed that I didn't think it was fair for me to feel pressured into attending when I was already struggling. Things escalated quickly, and I ended up saying that it wasn’t my fault if he couldn’t understand that not everyone has the same emotional capacity at times.

In retaliation, my brother decided to take it upon himself to spill the beans about my struggles to the family, claiming that I was being selfish and that I didn’t care about our dad’s feelings. This caused a wave of messages from our relatives, many of whom were upset with me for not showing up. I felt betrayed by my brother for sharing my personal struggles without my consent, and it only added to my stress.

After the party, I confronted him about it. We ended up arguing again, and I told him that he was being a drama queen about the whole situation. I felt justified as he was the one who escalated things. However, I also recognized that maybe I could have handled my initial refusal to go differently instead of lashing out.

Now, our family is split. Some are siding with me, saying I have the right to prioritize my mental health, while others think I should just suck it up for the sake of family. My brother won't talk to me, and the atmosphere at family gatherings is tense.

Some of us don’t have that luxury.” That stung, and I tried to explain that it wasn’t about money but about support.

Fast forward to the vacation. I posted some pictures on social media, and while most of my friends were supportive, Sarah commented, “Wow, great for you. But it’s not like you can afford this lifestyle all the time, right?” I was hurt, so I decided to confront her. I told her that her constant negativity was really affecting our friendship and that it seemed she was just envious of my happiness.

That led to a heated argument where we both said things we regretted. I called her out for being a buzzkill and she accused me of being insensitive to her struggles. After that, I felt bad about what I said and reached out to apologize, but she ignored my messages. Now, we’re both stuck in this awkward silence, and I feel like I lost a friend over something that could’ve been resolved differently.

So, AITA for confronting her about her negativity and calling her out, or was she wrong for making me feel bad about my happiness?",558,2934,0.94,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_52399,2020-04-26 00:00:00,ESH,1812,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"I’ve been living with my best friend, Jake, for about a year after he lost his job and needed a place to stay. I’m a 29-year-old woman and he's 30. He has been struggling financially and emotionally, and I felt it was my responsibility to help him out. However, things have become increasingly tense between us.

Initially, I was supportive and encouraged him to apply for jobs, but he spends most of his days playing video games and barely contributes to household chores. I try to keep things clean and organized, but he often leaves a mess everywhere, and it drives me nuts. I’ve brought it up to him multiple times, but he brushes it off as me being uptight.

Last week, after coming home from a long day at work, I discovered that he had invited a bunch of friends over while I was gone, and they had turned the living room into a huge mess with empty pizza boxes and drinks everywhere. I snapped and started yelling at him in front of his friends, telling him how inconsiderate he was being and that he needed to get his life together. It was embarrassing for both of us.

In the heat of the moment, I also pointed out that he has been living off my kindness for way too long, and maybe he should stop playing the victim and start taking responsibility for his life. I felt awful afterward, but I was so frustrated.

He didn’t talk to me for a couple of days and when he finally did, he said I was a terrible friend for calling him out in front of his friends and that I should’ve handled it privately. He accused me of being judgmental and not understanding what he was going through. 

I get that I was harsh, but I also feel like he needed to hear it. I’ve been trying to help him, but I’m at my wit's end. I can’t keep living in a messy house while he does nothing. 

So, AITA for losing my cool and calling out my friend for his behavior? Or is he being overly sensitive?",594,1913,0.65,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_66140,2020-03-16 00:00:00,ESH,1882,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, here’s the situation. My girlfriend and I have been together for about a year, and we tend to argue about household responsibilities. I’m generally the one who keeps things organized and tidy, while she can be a bit messy and forgetful. We’ve had discussions about this, but I feel like I often end up doing things just to keep the peace.

Last week, we had a huge argument because I found dirty dishes piled up in the sink again, and I’d specifically reminded her to wash them before I got home from work. I was frustrated because it felt like my reminders were falling on deaf ears. When I confronted her about it, she got defensive and said she’d been busy with work and school, and that I should be more understanding.

Fast forward to the weekend, we decided to host a small get-together with some friends. I spent the whole Saturday cleaning the apartment and preparing snacks, while she said she’d handle the drinks. The night of the gathering rolls around, and as guests arrive, she realizes she forgot to buy the drinks. She panicked and told me we needed to run to the store last minute.

At that point, I was already stressed from cleaning and setting everything up, so I snapped and told her that I couldn't believe she forgot again. I was really harsh and said that if she wanted to do things her way, she could handle them herself. She ended up going to the store on her own, and when she got back, she was visibly upset.

After the party, we ended up having a big talk where we both aired our frustrations. I felt like I had the right to be upset because it felt like I was always picking up the slack, but I also recognized that my reaction was out of line. She acknowledged that she needed to be more organized, but she also pointed out that I could be more supportive instead of throwing accusations at her.

So, I’m wondering, was I in the wrong for being upset and snapping at her, or was she wrong for not following through on her part? I feel like we both contributed to the mess, so what do you guys think?",316,1101,0.72,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_66342,2022-11-29 00:00:00,ESH,2033,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, a while back, I went to this local café that I love. While I was there, I bumped into Jake, an old friend from high school. We hadn’t seen each other in years, so we started catching up. During our conversation, Jake mentioned he was dating someone new, and I was genuinely happy for him.

As we talked more, he casually mentioned that his new girlfriend was someone I used to be close friends with, Sarah. I hadn’t spoken to Sarah in a while because we had a pretty big falling out over something petty, but I still remembered our good times.

Feeling a bit nostalgic but also with that gossip itch, I asked Jake how things were going with Sarah. He started gushing about her, saying how they had so much in common and how great she was. But I couldn’t help but feel a little uneasy about it. I decided to tread lightly and just said, “Oh, that’s cool! You know, Sarah can be a bit difficult sometimes. Just make sure you really know what you’re getting into.”

Jake laughed it off and said he could handle it, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I should share my past experiences with Sarah. So, after a bit of hesitation, I told him about some of the drama that led to our falling out—mainly how she would get jealous easily and how that affected our friendship. I thought I was just looking out for him.

Fast forward a week or two, and I’m on social media when I see that Jake and Sarah have had a massive fight over something I said. It turns out, Jake mentioned my comments to Sarah, and she was furious with me for “spreading rumors” about her. I felt terrible because I never meant to cause any trouble.

Now, I’ve been getting messages from Sarah, calling me all sorts of names and saying I should have kept my mouth shut. Jake is stuck in the middle, trying to play peacemaker, but I can tell he’s frustrated with me for getting involved. 

I feel guilty for saying anything, but at the same time, I wanted to protect my friend. Should I have just kept my opinions to myself? Am I the asshole here?",858,1274,0.63,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_48456,2018-11-13 00:00:00,ESH,2016,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Yesterday, I (27F) went to a friend's dinner party where I knew most of the guests. One of the attendees, a guy I used to date (let's call him Mike, 28M), was also there. We had a brief relationship a few years back, but it ended amicably, and we've remained friends since.

During the dinner, the conversation shifted to relationships, and Mike brought up how he's been on dating apps. I made a light-hearted joke about how he should pick up a hobby instead of swiping. He laughed but then leaned in and said, “Well, if I had someone like you, I wouldn't need to swipe.” I felt flattered but also a bit uncomfortable since I know he has a habit of flirting when he drinks.

As the night went on, Mike kept making suggestive comments and trying to touch my arm. I was trying to keep things light, so I just laughed it off, but it started to annoy me. At one point, he said, “We had great chemistry back then. What’s stopping us from trying again?” I felt put on the spot and replied, “Maybe you should focus on someone who actually wants to date you, Mike.”

That didn’t sit well with him, and he shot back, “Well, maybe if you weren’t so stuck up, you’d actually have someone pursuing you.” I was taken aback and replied, “At least I’m not desperate to hook up with my ex at a party.” We both got heated, and the atmosphere shifted. He called me a “prude” and I called him “pathetic,” and it escalated to the point where other guests started feeling uncomfortable.

After that, we both retreated to different corners of the room, and I overheard Mike telling another guest that I was acting like a “bitch” for rejecting him. Meanwhile, I vented to a couple of my friends about how he was being overly aggressive. 

Now, people are divided on who was in the wrong. Some think I should have been nicer, while others say Mike crossed a line. I feel like we both let our tempers get the best of us and ended up ruining the vibe for everyone. AITA?",419,572,0.71,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_63074,2018-10-19 00:00:00,ESH,1944,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"So, my friends and I decided to go to a concert last weekend. We were all really excited about it because it was a band we loved, and we had been planning this for months. We got to the venue early to grab a good spot and enjoy the atmosphere before the show started.

As we were waiting, I noticed a group of people nearby who were obviously drunk and being loud. They were singing along to the music playing before the concert but were way off-key and just obnoxious. At first, I tried to ignore them, but as they got rowdier, I could see my friends starting to get annoyed.

In a moment of frustration, I turned to them and told them to shut up. I didn’t yell, but I was definitely loud enough for them to hear. One of them, a girl, looked at me and said something like, ""Chill out, it’s just a concert!"" and that made me even angrier. I replied, ""Yeah, but you’re ruining it for everyone else, so how about you keep it down!"" 

That set off a little back-and-forth, with her saying I was being a buzzkill and me insisting they were being disrespectful. It escalated to the point where our group was involved, and we were all exchanging heated words. Eventually, security came over to see what was going on, and honestly, I felt embarrassed for causing such a scene. Security ended up moving the drunk group away, and I felt a mix of relief and guilt.

After the concert, my friends were divided. Some thought I did the right thing by standing up for our space, while others felt I could have handled it more maturely. I can’t shake the feeling that I was wrong for escalating things and making a scene, but at the same time, I felt justified in wanting to enjoy the concert without distraction.

Everyone sucks here,"My partner and I have been together for five years, and we share a lot of interests, including hiking and traveling. We both work full-time, and while we usually split expenses evenly, we sometimes treat each other to things we enjoy. 

Recently, I planned a surprise weekend trip to a national park for our anniversary. I booked a cozy cabin, arranged for some fun outdoor activities, and even packed our favorite snacks. I was really excited to surprise them since they’ve been stressed at work and could use a break.

On the day of the surprise, I revealed the trip, and my partner was thrilled. However, when we arrived at the cabin, I realized I had forgotten to pack any of the hiking gear—no shoes, no backpacks, nothing. I panicked a little but thought we could still make the most of it with some relaxing time. My partner was really disappointed since they had been looking forward to hiking.

To make it up to them, I suggested we go into town and buy some gear. We ended up spending more than I anticipated, and I felt guilty about the extra cost. My partner was frustrated with me for forgetting the gear in the first place, and I felt defensive since I had put in so much effort planning the trip.

In the heat of the moment, I snapped at them, saying I was trying to do something nice for us and it wasn’t my fault if they couldn't appreciate it. My partner shot back that if I had cared enough, I wouldn’t have forgotten the gear at all.

We ended up arguing over it the entire weekend, ruining what was supposed to be a lovely getaway. I feel bad for how I reacted, but I also think my partner could have been more understanding about the effort I put into planning the trip.

Everyone sucks here,"So, I (28M) have been friends with this guy, Jake (30M), for a few years. We have a pretty tight-knit friend group and hang out often. Recently, Jake started dating a girl named Sarah (29F). I’ve met her a few times, and while she seems nice, I can tell she has a bit of a controlling streak, especially when it comes to Jake's friendships. 

A few weeks ago, we planned a weekend camping trip, just the guys. Two days before, Jake texts the group saying Sarah wants to come along. I thought it was kind of weird since it was supposed to be a guy's trip, but I didn’t say anything. When we got there, Sarah ended up dominating the entire trip with her ideas, like where we should set up camp, what food we should eat, and even how we should spend our time. It became less about hanging out and more about accommodating her.

I tried to lighten the mood and suggested some classic campfire games, but she shot me down, saying they were boring. Meanwhile, Jake just kind of went along with whatever she wanted, clearly prioritizing her over his friends. I was frustrated but didn’t want to ruin the trip, so I kept my mouth shut.

By the second night, I had enough. I cracked a joke about how it felt like a couples’ retreat instead of a camping trip. Sarah didn’t take it well and got defensive, saying she was just trying to make the trip fun for everyone. I felt bad for the comment, but I was also feeling stifled. Jake tried to smooth things over, but I could tell he was annoyed we were arguing.

After a tense moment, I blurted out that it was supposed to be a guy’s trip and that we didn’t need her telling us what to do. Things escalated, and she ended up leaving the camp early. Jake was furious with me for ruining the trip and said I should have just accepted her presence. He said I could have just been nicer instead of being a jerk. I ended up leaving too because I felt like the atmosphere was ruined.

Now, our friends are split. Some think I was right to stand up for myself and our trip, while others feel like I was a huge ass for calling out Sarah. Jake is still mad at me and says our friendship has changed because I couldn’t just let it go. 

TL;DR: Went on a camping trip that turned into a couples' retreat thanks to my friend's girlfriend. I made a comment that upset her, causing a fight, and now I'm being blamed for ruining the trip and my friendship with Jake. 

Edit: I realize now I could have handled it better and maybe just let it slide, but it was really frustrating to feel pushed out of my own trip.",348,918,0.81,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_10037,2019-05-11 00:00:00,ESH,2536,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Okay, so I guess I need to explain what happened and why I feel like we’re all kind of at fault here.

I (28F) have a cousin, Sarah (26F), who just had her first baby. I was really excited for her and wanted to help out as much as possible. To celebrate the new arrival, our family decided to throw a baby shower. Sarah was super specific about wanting everything a certain way, from the decorations to the food.

Now, I totally get that she’s a new mom and has a lot on her plate, but I felt like she was being extra controlling. For example, she insisted on a specific color palette for the decorations that I thought was pretty dull. I had some great ideas for a more vibrant theme that I thought would be way more fun, but she shot them down every time. I eventually just went along with it, but I was really frustrated.

When the day of the shower arrived, things were already tense. Sarah was running around stressing over every little detail. I tried to pitch in and help, but it felt like she just wanted everything to be her way. At one point, I pointed out a mistake in one of the games she planned, and she snapped at me, saying I was ruining her special day.

In a moment of frustration, I jokingly said, “You know, if you keep this up, you might scare your kid away from parties.” It wasn’t the nicest thing to say, and I regretted it immediately. It was meant to be light-hearted, but it came across as rude, and she got really upset.

After that, I tried to help her calm down, but she was still mad at me. To make things worse, during the gift opening, I made a sarcastic comment about how many onesies she got, thinking it would lighten the mood. Instead, it just added more tension, and Sarah told me I was being an asshole.

Now, I can see why she was upset. She’s just had a baby and is probably feeling overwhelmed. But I felt like I was doing my best to help, and her controlling behavior was driving me nuts. 

So, I guess I’m wondering if I was the asshole for my comments, or if she was being unreasonable with her expectations. 

Am I the asshole here, or are we both just kind of at fault?",441,2034,0.58,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_99785,2019-09-24 00:00:00,ESH,2116,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"Hello everyone,

I'm (28F) currently in a bit of a conflict with my best friend (29F), and I could use your perspective. We've been friends for over a decade, and our relationship has always been very close. However, things have taken a turn recently, and I feel like we both might be in the wrong.

Last month, my friend went through a tough breakup. She was devastated, and I tried to be there for her as much as I could. I listened to her vent, offered support, and even helped her pack up her ex's stuff to take to his place. I thought I was doing a good job of being a supportive friend.

However, in the middle of this, I also had my own life happenings. I got a promotion at work, and I was excited to celebrate this achievement. When I brought it up to her, she seemed uninterested and quickly changed the subject back to her breakup. I tried to understand, but it felt like I was always the one putting in the emotional labor while my own successes were sidelined.

A few weeks later, I decided to host a small get-together to celebrate my promotion. I invited a few friends, including her. She initially said she would come, but later texted me saying she was too overwhelmed and needed to focus on herself. I completely understood and told her it was okay. However, during the party, I posted some pictures on social media, and that’s when things escalated.

My friend saw the pictures and messaged me, upset that she wasn’t included in my celebration. She accused me of not being supportive of her during her hard time and that I was being insensitive by celebrating when she was suffering. I explained that I had tried to support her through her breakup, and it was just a small celebration of my achievement. I didn't mean to hurt her, but I also wanted to share my happiness with others.

After that, we had a big argument over text. I said that while I’m here for her, I also have my own life to live and can’t solely focus on her struggles. She responded that I was being selfish and that friends should prioritize each other’s feelings. We both ended up saying hurtful things, and now there’s a rift between us.

I still care about her and want to mend things, but I also feel like I deserve to celebrate my own achievements without guilt. I’m not sure if I was wrong for wanting to celebrate or if she was wrong for not being able to share in my happiness. 

So, AITA for celebrating my promotion while my friend was going through a breakup, or is she overreacting? ESH?",513,1486,0.77,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_80149,2023-06-17 00:00:00,ESH,2489,AITA

The day before the party, I noticed that my favorite recipe for a dessert was missing from my collection. I asked Sam if he had a copy, and he told me he had given it to his girlfriend, who is also a mutual friend of ours.

I texted her, and she said she would send it over, but she took a while to respond. Not wanting to be left empty-handed, I decided to improvise and make a different dessert instead. I went to the store, bought the ingredients, and spent the evening making a layered cake.

When I arrived at the party, I was proud of my creation and excited to share it with everyone. However, when I got there, I noticed that Sam's girlfriend had baked the original dessert I had wanted to make, and it was already on the table. I felt a bit deflated but tried to brush it off.

As the night went on, I noticed that people were gravitating toward her dessert over mine. Feeling a bit competitive, I jokingly pointed out how mine was better because it had more layers and was home-baked, but my tone may have come off as snarky. 

Sam's girlfriend seemed offended and told me that she was proud of her baking too. I tried to laugh it off, but the atmosphere got tense. Later, she pulled me aside and told me I was being rude and should be more supportive of her efforts. I defended myself, saying I was just trying to have fun and that I didn't mean to offend anyone.

Eventually, things cooled down, but a few of our friends later told me that I could have handled it better and that I shouldn’t have compared the desserts.

The whole vibe was great, and everyone was having a good time. I knew most of the people there, but there were a few guests I didn't recognize.

As the night went on, I ended up chatting with this group of people, including one guy who was really friendly. We started joking around and having a good laugh. At one point, he jokingly suggested we should all take a shot to celebrate the party. I thought it was a fun idea, so I agreed and went to the bar to get the shots.

When I got to the bar, I ordered the shots and when they were served, I realized I could just put them on my tab since I was one of the hosts for the evening. I had already been drinking, and I was feeling quite generous, so I told the bartender to put the shots on my tab.

After that, I went back to the group and we all took the shots together, having a blast. We kept the energy up, and a few more drinks followed. I thought we were all just enjoying the night together, and I didn’t think much of it after that.

Later in the evening, the friendly guy from the group approached me and said, “Hey, thanks for the shots! We should do this more often!” I smiled and said, “Yeah, no problem!” I thought he was just being friendly, not realizing he had assumed I was treating everyone for the night.

Fast forward a bit, and I started hearing whispers that some of the guests were unhappy. Apparently, they thought I was covering their drinks for the whole night. I had no idea they were racking up a tab thinking they were on my tab. When I found out, I was a bit taken aback. I mean, I was just trying to have a good time and didn’t expect everyone to assume I was buying them drinks all night long.

Eventually, the night ended, and I got a text from one of the guests saying they were disappointed and felt entitled to more drinks since I had bought a few shots. I replied that I was sorry for the misunderstanding but I couldn’t pay for their drinks all night just because I bought a few shots.

They called me selfish and said I could’ve easily afforded it since I was the one who initiated the shots. I was frustrated by their reaction and felt they were being unreasonable. I later told my friend about everything, and they said it wasn’t my fault, but I still felt a bit guilty.

Looking back, I guess I could have been more clear about my intentions with the shots, but it was all in good fun. AITA?",619,664,0.68,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_85779,2023-01-13 00:00:00,ESH,2529,AITA

Last month, I was having a particularly stressful week with midterms coming up. I was studying late at night and often needed to grab snacks or drinks from the kitchen. Lisa, on the other hand, likes to keep things neat and tidy, and she had mentioned a few times before that I should be more considerate about cleaning up after myself.

One night, I was working on a big project and made a mess in the kitchen. I left some dirty dishes in the sink and crumbs all over the counter. In the middle of my studying, Lisa came home and flipped out. She started yelling at me about how I never clean up after myself and how it’s unfair to her because she has to deal with my mess.

In a moment of frustration, I snapped back and said she was overreacting, and that if she couldn't handle a few dishes, maybe she shouldn't live with someone. That definitely didn’t help the situation. She started crying and told me I didn’t care about her feelings or our living situation.

The next day, I felt bad about how I reacted, but I still didn’t clean up right away. I wanted to take a stand and show her I could do what I wanted in my own space. A few days later, she left a note on the fridge reminding me to clean up after myself. I responded with a sarcastic note saying, ""Thanks for the reminder, but this is a shared space, not a dictatorship.""

So, my partner and I have been together for three years, and we've recently moved in together. We both have kids from previous relationships, but we’ve tried to blend our families as best as possible. My son ""Jake"" (10M) has been having a tough time adjusting to the new living situation, especially with my partner’s daughter ""Emily"" (9F).

I’ve talked to Jake about sharing, but he feels like his hard work is being taken for granted. I understand both sides, but I also want them to get along.

One evening, after another argument, I lost my temper and told Jake that he needed to stop being so selfish and to share the console with Emily. I said something like, ""You’re acting like a brat, and if you can’t share, I’ll just take it away from you."" I immediately regretted my words, especially since I know Jake is already feeling insecure about the whole blending family situation.

My partner overheard and got upset with me for how I spoke to Jake. She said I should be more understanding of what he’s going through and that I shouldn’t use threats to manage the situation. Instead of cooling down, I snapped back that she should be addressing Emily’s behavior as well.

This led to a huge argument between us, where we both said hurtful things about how we handle our kids and our parenting styles.

A few weeks ago, my partner and I hosted a small gathering at our place, and we invited some friends over, including my friend Sarah. Sarah has a tendency to be a bit loud and dramatic, but she’s fun and we usually enjoy her company. However, she sometimes takes over the conversation, which can be a little overwhelming.

During the gathering, we were all sitting around chatting when Sarah started telling a story about her recent vacation. It was a long and detailed story, and while it was entertaining to some, I could see that a few people were starting to lose interest. My partner, who tends to be more blunt, interrupted her at one point and said, “Can we move on? This is dragging a bit.” 

Sarah looked hurt and taken aback but tried to laugh it off. She made a joke about how she could talk about her trip all night, but my partner just shrugged and said, “No offense, but we’re all just trying to have fun here.” At that point, the atmosphere got a bit tense.

I attempted to diffuse the situation by saying something like, “Well, Sarah, we love hearing your stories, but maybe we can hear about your trip later?” It didn’t help much, and Sarah ended up getting quiet for the rest of the night, which made me feel bad. 

After the gathering, Sarah texted me saying she felt like my partner was rude and that I didn’t defend her. I told her that I thought my partner was trying to be honest, but that maybe he could’ve been more respectful in how he said it. Then my partner got mad at me for not having his back.

Now I’m stuck in the middle. I feel like my partner could’ve handled it better, but I also think Sarah can be a bit much sometimes.

However, we didn’t want to outright tell her that, so we tried to express our concerns diplomatically. That didn’t go over well, and Sarah ended up being very defensive about it.

In a moment of frustration, I sent a group text suggesting that maybe Sarah could have a “date night” with Eric another time, and that we should keep this trip for just the original group. I didn’t think it was that harsh, but it triggered a huge argument in our group chat. Some friends sided with me, saying it was about maintaining the group’s vibe, while others thought I was being exclusionary and rude.

The day before the trip, Sarah decided to back out, saying she needed to prioritize her relationship. I felt terrible because I didn’t want to hurt her feelings, but I also thought that Eric would have changed the dynamic too much. The whole thing has left a bad taste in our mouths, and now we’re all arguing about who was in the right.

Looking back, I realize I could have approached the situation differently instead of sending that text. But at the same time, I believe we all share some responsibility for how it spiraled out of control. Now our group feels fractured, and I’m not sure how to fix it.",984,1366,0.61,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_70148,2022-01-16 00:00:00,ESH,1771,AITA
Everyone sucks here,"A few months ago, I (29F) started a new job and quickly became friends with a coworker, Jake (30M). He was going through a tough time; he had just moved to the city and was struggling to find a decent place to live that he could afford. I offered him a room in my apartment with a very low rent to help him out, thinking it would be a good situation for both of us.

Initially, everything worked out well. We got along great, and I enjoyed having him around. However, over time, I started noticing that he would often prioritize hanging out with other coworkers over me. I felt a bit abandoned, especially since I had opened my home to him. 

One weekend, I planned a small get-together at my place for some friends, including Jake. I invited him ahead of time, but when the day came, he showed up with a couple of his other friends from work and completely ignored me. They took over the living room, blasting music and not really engaging with me or the other guests I had invited. I felt upset and disrespected, but I tried to brush it off.

Later that night, when I tried to join in on their conversation, Jake made a joke at my expense in front of everyone, which really hurt my feelings. I called him out on it, saying it wasn’t cool to disrespect me in my own home. He got defensive and said I was being too sensitive. I ended up leaving the room and feeling really frustrated.

The next day, I told him how I felt about the situation, and he apologized but didn’t seem to grasp why it bothered me so much. I explained that I felt like he took advantage of my kindness by treating me poorly. This led to a pretty heated argument where we both said things we didn’t mean. He accused me of being a bad friend for not being more understanding of his need to socialize, and I told him he was being ungrateful after I had helped him out.

Now, I’m wondering if I was too harsh in my reaction to him and if I should have just let it go. At the same time, I feel like he should have been more considerate of me as his roommate and friend. We’re both feeling a bit resentful now, and I’m not sure how to move forward. So, AITA for calling him out and expressing my feelings, or did I take it too far?",912,2738,0.94,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_32656,2019-03-18 00:00:00,ESH,2199,AITA
