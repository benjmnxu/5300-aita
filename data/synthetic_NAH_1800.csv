No one is the Asshole,"My name is Alex (F16), and I've always been a bit of a tomboy. I love sports, climbing, and hanging out with my guy friends. My parents have been supportive, but they’ve always encouraged me to embrace my feminine side as well. 

Recently, my mom suggested I try a makeup tutorial and join her for a girls' day out. I didn't want to hurt her feelings, but I really didn't feel like doing it. I politely declined, telling her I prefer spending my time doing things I enjoy. 

She seemed disappointed, but I thought it was okay because I’ve always been true to myself. My younger sister, who is 12, overheard the conversation and got upset. She feels like I'm rejecting our mom and not being a good role model for her.

Now, my sister is avoiding me and my mom has been trying to smooth things over, feeling torn between us. I just wanted to be honest about who I am without creating tension. AITA?",813,1194,0.98,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_16163,2019-05-16 00:00:00,NAH,896,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I’m a junior in college, and I’ve been working part-time at a local cafe for the past year. Recently, my friend Sarah invited me to go on a weekend trip with her and some other friends to the beach. I was really excited about it because I haven't had a proper break in months.

However, I also have a big project due for one of my classes the Monday after the trip. I've been struggling with it and know that I need to dedicate a lot of time to finish it properly. I talked to Sarah about my dilemma, and she understood but suggested that I could work on the project during the trip since we would have some downtime.

I thought about it, but I’m worried that I wouldn’t be able to focus with everyone having fun around me. I also don't want to be that person who brings schoolwork on a trip and brings the mood down. So I ended up telling Sarah that I might have to skip the trip to focus on my project, even though I really want to go.

Now I'm feeling guilty about not being there with friends, but I also think I need to prioritize my schoolwork. I want to support my friends and have fun, but I also need to take care of my responsibilities. Would I be the asshole if I decided not to go on the trip because of my project?",583,2006,0.63,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_93194,2024-04-11 00:00:00,NAH,1227,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I'm currently on a camping trip with a few friends at a state park. We found a great spot and set up our tents, but there’s a family camping nearby who seem to be having a really loud party. They’ve been laughing, playing music, and even setting off some fireworks. It’s all in good fun, and I totally understand that they’re just enjoying their time, but it’s been hard for me and my friends to relax and enjoy the peaceful nature around us.

We went for a hike earlier and when we returned, they were still going strong. I didn’t want to ruin their fun or start a confrontation, but I was really hoping to enjoy a quiet evening by the campfire. My friends and I tried to make our own fun, but it was tough to hear each other over the noise.

At one point, one of the adults from their group came over to check on us and offered us some food. We chatted for a bit and I mentioned how we were hoping for a quieter night. They seemed understanding and said they would try to keep it down, but then they went back and cranked up the music again.

In the end, we all ended up having a good time, but I really appreciated their willingness to listen to my concerns. I think everyone was just trying to enjoy their weekend, and it was nice that we could communicate without any hard feelings. Just an interesting camping experience!",300,1964,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_17648,2022-04-05 00:00:00,NAH,1327,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, I recently attended a family gathering where my cousin was celebrating her engagement. It was a lovely event, and everyone was excited for her. During the evening, my aunt, who is known for her strong opinions, started making comments about how she thinks this engagement is a mistake because my cousin's fiancé has a small business that isn't doing too well. I could see my cousin getting visibly upset, and I felt bad for her.

After my aunt made another comment about how my cousin could do better, I gently interjected and said something like, ""Auntie, I think it’s important to support their love and choices rather than focus on financial success. They’re happy, and that’s what matters."" My aunt wasn't pleased and shot back that I was too young to understand the real world. 

The conversation shifted, and while I didn’t mean to disrespect my aunt, I felt it was important to stand up for my cousin. Afterward, my cousin thanked me for speaking up, but my aunt avoided me for the rest of the night, and I overheard her telling other relatives that I was disrespectful. I didn’t mean to cause a rift, and I genuinely wanted to support my cousin. So, am I the asshole for speaking out during a family celebration?",197,1996,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_29871,2019-12-01 00:00:00,NAH,1224,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been together for over three years and live in a cozy apartment with large windows that overlook a busy street. It’s a lively area, and while we love the natural light, we also recognize that our windows are quite open to the outside world.

The other day, I was working from home, and I noticed my partner had decided to put on a performance of sorts in front of the windows. She was dancing around without any curtains drawn, completely unaware of the people passing by. While I absolutely support her being confident and expressive, I felt a bit uncomfortable knowing that anyone walking by could see everything.

I mentioned to her that maybe it wasn’t the best idea to dance so openly in front of the windows, especially since we live in such a public space. She was surprised and said she didn’t think it was a big deal, and that she loved feeling free and uninhibited in her own home. I completely understand where she’s coming from, but I also worry about how people might perceive us if they see her like that.

We ended up having a discussion about it, and while we both expressed our feelings respectfully, I still felt torn. I want her to feel comfortable, but I also worry about the potential for unwanted attention. 

So, I’m left questioning if I was being too controlling or if I had a valid concern. Am I the asshole for wanting to protect our privacy?",784,1364,0.58,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_33133,2022-01-26 00:00:00,NAH,1391,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My (25F) best friend (26F) recently started dating someone new, and they seem really happy together. However, I’ve noticed that she's been less available to hang out with me since the relationship began. I completely understand that she wants to spend time with her new partner, but I’ve been feeling a bit neglected and left out.

Last week, I decided to reach out and let her know how I was feeling. I texted her something like:

""Hey, I’ve noticed we haven’t hung out as much since you started dating Alex. I’m really happy for you, but I miss our time together. Can we plan a day to catch up soon?""

She responded positively, saying she had been so wrapped up in her new relationship that she didn't realize I was feeling this way. We ended up planning a day to hang out, and it felt great to reconnect.

I wanted to check if I was out of line for expressing my feelings or if it was reasonable to want to maintain our friendship even as her relationship grows. So, WIBTA for reaching out to her about this? 

Edit: Thanks for the support! It was a tough conversation, but I’m glad I brought it up.",1,1931,0.82,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_35559,2021-06-10 00:00:00,NAH,1102,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I’ve been friends with Sam for a few years, and we’ve always had a pretty open and honest dynamic. Recently, Sam started dating someone new, and while I was happy for him, I noticed he was spending less time with his friends and more time with his girlfriend, which is totally normal. However, as his friend, I felt a bit left out and missed our hangouts.

One day, we had plans to catch up over coffee, but he canceled last minute because his girlfriend wanted to go to a concert, which I understood but still felt disappointed. I sent him a lighthearted message saying something like, “I guess I should just get used to being the third wheel.” He responded with a longer message explaining how he was trying to balance his time between his girlfriend and friends, and I appreciated his honesty.

After that, I thought about how I could better express my feelings without sounding like I was blaming him. So, I decided to reach out to him again and suggested that we plan a regular hangout, just the two of us, so we could both make an effort to keep our friendship strong. We ended up discussing it, and he was really receptive, which made me feel good.

In the end, I don’t think either of us did anything wrong; I wanted to express my feelings without putting pressure on him, and he was trying to navigate his new relationship while still being a good friend. So, I’m wondering if I was the asshole for feeling neglected or if it was just a natural part of changing friendships.

No one is the Asshole,"I’ve been struggling with a situation for a while now, and I’m hoping to get some perspective. 

About a year ago, my best friend from college, Sarah, and I had a falling out. It started when she got really serious with her boyfriend, who I wasn’t a fan of. I felt he was pulling her away from our friendship, and I expressed my concerns. Unfortunately, my comments upset her, and we ended up having a huge argument. After that, we stopped talking completely.

Fast forward to a few months ago—I heard that Sarah was planning a small wedding and was inviting a limited number of friends and family. I was surprised when I didn’t receive an invitation. I assumed it was because of our fallout, and it stung a bit, but I understood she had to do what felt right for her.

Recently, a mutual friend reached out to me, saying that Sarah was feeling overwhelmed with wedding planning and was considering scaling back even more. This friend suggested that perhaps I could reach out to Sarah, apologize for my past comments, and offer my help. I thought about it and decided to send her a message, expressing my support and letting her know I was there if she needed anything.

Sarah responded, thanking me for reaching out but also made it clear that she was still upset about our previous argument and needed more time before we could reconnect. I completely respected her feelings and told her I understood. I also let her know I’d be cheering her on from a distance. 

I’ve been wondering if I should have just left things as they were. I don’t want to add any pressure to her during this time, but I also feel like I could have reached out sooner or handled things differently. Am I in the wrong for trying to reach out after everything that happened?",717,1309,0.88,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_40657,2019-10-30 00:00:00,NAH,1749,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I recently organized a small gathering for my friends to celebrate my new job. I was really excited and wanted to prepare a nice dinner for everyone. I decided to make a variety of dishes, including a vegetarian lasagna since one of my friends is vegetarian. 

A couple of days before the gathering, another friend of mine, who follows a strict keto diet, asked if I could make a keto-friendly dish as well. At first, I felt a bit overwhelmed because I had already planned the meal, and I wasn't sure how to accommodate another dietary restriction without complicating things too much. I told him I would try to make a keto-friendly side, but I also mentioned that the lasagna and other dishes would be primarily vegetarian and not keto-friendly.

When my friend arrived, he seemed disappointed that I hadn't made a separate main dish for him and voiced his frustration. I apologized and explained that I had tried to accommodate everyone as best I could within the time frame I had. We ended up having a great evening, but I could tell he felt left out because he couldn't eat the main dish.

In retrospect, I wonder if I could have handled the situation better by finding an alternative dish that would work for both him and my vegetarian friend. Am I the asshole for not making a separate keto dish?",443,2981,0.8,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_17414,2024-08-06 00:00:00,NAH,1302,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I've been dating my boyfriend for about two years now, and we generally have a great relationship. However, we approach certain things differently, like how we handle our friendships. 

My boyfriend has a close-knit group of friends from college, and they tend to hang out a lot, often including group trips and gatherings that can get quite expensive. I, on the other hand, have a larger circle but I usually prefer more low-key get-togethers, like coffee or a simple movie night. 

Recently, he organized a weekend trip with his friends to a cabin, and it was quite pricey. He invited me, but I hesitated because I knew it would stretch my budget. I mentioned to him that I'd love to join but couldn't contribute as much as the others because of my financial situation. He insisted that it was fine and that we could split the cost, but I felt uncomfortable accepting that since I wouldn’t be able to enjoy the trip fully.

After thinking it over, I decided to decline the invitation, hoping to not cause any issues. I told him I really appreciated the invite but that I would sit this one out. He seemed a bit disappointed but said he understood. 

When he came back from the trip, he shared all the fun stories and experiences he had with his friends. I didn't want to seem bitter, but I felt a pang of regret about not joining. It wasn't that I didn't want to be there; it was just about managing my finances wisely.

A few days later, we had a conversation about it. I expressed my feelings and explained why I chose not to go. He said he appreciated my honesty and understood that everyone has different financial boundaries. We ended up having a good discussion about balancing our different social circles and how we can support each other in our choices.

I don’t think either of us were wrong in our approaches; we just have different perspectives on socializing and finances.

No one is the Asshole,"A few months ago, I discovered that my childhood best friend, who I hadn’t seen in years, was coming back to our hometown for a week-long visit. We had always talked about reconnecting, and I was really excited to finally catch up and reminisce about our old times together. To make things special, I suggested we plan a day to go hiking at our favorite spot.

I shared my plans with my partner, who also has a close relationship with my friend and was thrilled about the reunion. However, when I mentioned the hiking trip to my friend, she expressed that she wanted to include her partner in our day. I understood her desire to share the experience, but I was a bit disappointed because I had envisioned this as a special day just for the two of us.

I decided to compromise and suggested that we invite her partner for just part of the day, leaving the morning for just the two of us to catch up. My friend agreed, and we made a plan. When we finally met up, the day went really well. We hiked, caught up on life, and my friend's partner joined us later. Everyone had a great time, and I was glad we could find a way to include them without losing our special moment.

Looking back, I feel like everyone was just trying to make the most of our time together, and while I was initially a bit disappointed, it turned into a wonderful day for all of us.

No one is the Asshole,"So, a little backstory: I'm a huge animal lover, and I volunteer at a local animal shelter. Recently, I started fostering a dog who had a rough past and needed a lot of socialization. I’ve been working hard to help him adjust to being around people and other animals.

One day, I invited a few friends over for a small gathering, and I mentioned that I was fostering this dog. One of my friends, who is not particularly fond of dogs, seemed a bit uncomfortable but said they would be fine with it. I made sure to keep the dog in a separate room at first to give everyone some space.

As the evening went on, I thought it would be nice to let the dog join us for a bit, thinking he’d be a hit and help everyone see how sweet he is. However, when I brought him out, my friend visibly tensed up and said, “I really don’t like dogs, can you please put him away?” 

I felt a bit hurt, but I respected their feelings and took the dog back to the other room without any argument. The rest of the night went smoothly, and my friend eventually warmed up to the idea of the dog being around, even asking a few questions about him.

I didn’t want to start a confrontation, but I couldn’t help feeling a little disappointed. I was just trying to share something I was passionate about.

No one is the Asshole,"So, a few weeks ago, my friend group decided to go on a weekend trip to the beach. There are six of us, and we all chipped in for a rental house. I’m 24, and I have a steady job, while my friend Jake, who is 22, has been struggling to find consistent work since he graduated college. 

As the trip approached, Jake mentioned multiple times that he was really excited but also worried about the cost of the trip. I totally understood and was willing to help him out. I offered to cover his share of the rental cost because I knew it would be a financial stretch for him. He was grateful and said he’d make it up to me somehow in the future.

Once we got to the beach house, we all contributed to cooking meals and cleaning up, but Jake mostly stayed on the sidelines. He didn’t help much with the chores, claiming he was “too tired” from the drive. I didn’t say anything at first because I wanted to enjoy the trip, but it started bothering me as the weekend went on. I thought about how I had been so willing to help him out, and it felt a bit one-sided.

On the last day, I finally spoke up and asked Jake if he could pitch in more. I explained that we all put in the effort to make the trip fun and manageable, and it would be great if he could help out a bit more, especially since I had covered his share. He seemed taken aback and said he didn’t realize it bothered me and would try to help more next time.

I didn’t mean to make him feel bad, but I felt like we needed to have an open conversation about everyone pulling their weight, especially since I was in a position to help him out. After the trip, we talked a little more about it, and I think we both came away understanding each other better.

In the end, I don’t think either of us is at fault. He’s in a tough spot, and I was willing to help, but it’s important for friends to have honest conversations about responsibilities.

We both have busy work schedules, and we're trying to figure out how to share responsibilities around the house. One day, we had a discussion about chores, and I suggested that we create a cleaning schedule to ensure that everything gets done fairly.

My partner was initially on board with the idea, but when I presented a detailed plan, they started to feel overwhelmed. They felt that I was being too rigid and not considering their preferences for a more spontaneous approach to cleaning. I could see they were frustrated, and I understood where they were coming from, as I tend to be more organized.

We ended up having a heated argument where I insisted that a schedule would help us work better together, while they argued that it would feel like a chore rather than a partnership. After a few days of tension, we both realized that we needed to find a compromise.

We sat down again and decided to create a more flexible plan that allowed for some structure but also left room for spontaneity. We agreed to check in with each other weekly to see how things were going and adjust as needed. This way, we both felt respected and heard in our preferences.

In the end, we both acknowledged that we had valid points and learned to communicate better about our differing styles. It was a learning experience for both of us, and we are now on the same page.

Jenna had been struggling with anxiety for a while, and she was open about it with me. I tried my best to support her, but sometimes I felt overwhelmed by her constant need for reassurance. I suggested she see a therapist, but she was hesitant. We had some heated discussions about mental health, and there were times I felt like I was walking on eggshells around her.

One day, I accidentally made a thoughtless comment about a situation she had shared with me, and it upset her deeply. She felt I was dismissing her feelings, which wasn’t my intention at all. I apologized, but the damage was done. She started distancing herself from me, and eventually, she told me that she needed space to focus on her mental health without feeling like she was burdening me.

I respected her decision and tried to give her the space she needed, but I missed our friendship terribly. I felt guilty for my comment and wished I could take it back. After a few months, I reached out to see how she was doing, but she told me she still needed more time apart.

I understand that she's going through a lot, and I genuinely want her to heal. I’m worried that I might have ruined our friendship forever, and I don’t want to push her away even more. 

So, I’m torn. I want to reach out to her again, maybe invite her to coffee to check in and see how she’s feeling, but I don't want to come off as pushy or inconsiderate of her needs. Would I be the asshole for trying to reconnect after she asked for space?

No one is the Asshole,"My sister is getting married soon, and I've been helping her with the planning. She’s really excited about everything, and she trusts my opinion. Recently, she wanted to do a themed wedding, something unique that reflects their personalities. They both love vintage retro styles, so they settled on a 1920s theme.

As we were working through the details, she asked me to help her design the invitations. I suggested we incorporate some modern twists to make them more accessible for her guests, like adding QR codes for RSVPs and links to their wedding website. She seemed hesitant at first, preferring to stick to traditional designs. I completely understand that she wants everything to feel authentic to the theme, but I thought finding a balance would be nice.

A few days later, she told me that our mom was very against any modern touches and thought it would ruin the ""authenticity"" of the vintage theme. Now, she's caught between what I suggested and what our mom wants. I feel bad for adding more stress to her planning, but I also want her to consider the practicality of some modern elements.

I’m wondering if I overstepped by pushing for a modern aspect when she’s clearly invested in the vintage theme.

I was frustrated, as this was the third time she had canceled plans for him in the past month.

No one is the Asshole,"My cousin and I have always had a competitive relationship, especially when it comes to sports. We both played soccer in high school, and even though we were on different teams, we would talk about our games and try to one-up each other on our performances. It was all in good fun, though, and we enjoyed the rivalry.

A few months ago, my cousin joined a local adult soccer league and invited me to come watch one of his games.

After the game, he confronted me, saying that I embarrassed him in front of his teammates and that I should have been more supportive instead of making it about my own achievements.

I didn’t think I was being a bad cousin, but I felt bad that my actions had hurt his feelings. I apologized, and we talked it out. He acknowledged that he was feeling pressured to perform and that my comments hit harder because of that. We both agreed that our competitive nature sometimes gets in the way of our relationship, but we also recognized that it’s part of what makes us close.

A week before the trip, Jenna told me that she might not be able to go because her boss scheduled a last-minute work event that she felt obligated to attend. I completely understood her situation and told her to do what she thought was best. However, after some back-and-forth, she decided she could manage to take the time off and would come with me.

She expressed that she shouldn't have come and should have focused on her career instead. I assured her that she deserved the break and that it was important to take time for herself.

When I called, I could tell they weren't in a great mood, but I encouraged them to come along, thinking it might lift their spirits. I genuinely wanted them to feel included and supported. 

However, when Alex arrived, they seemed even more withdrawn than before. I tried to engage them in conversation and even pulled aside a couple of our friends to help involve them, but Alex just didn't seem interested in participating.

My other friends seemed to think it was a good idea to invite Alex, but they also felt bad about how it turned out.

My best friend, Sarah, is also a great cook, but she has a distinct dietary preference; she follows a strict vegan diet due to her ethical beliefs.

A couple of weeks ago, I hosted a dinner party and included a mix of dishes that catered to different dietary preferences. I made a delicious pasta dish with a creamy sauce, which I had planned to make vegan-friendly specifically for Sarah. However, amidst the chaos of preparing for the party, I mistakenly added cream and cheese to the sauce before realizing my error. 

When Sarah arrived, I immediately apologized for the oversight and offered her other vegan options I had prepared, such as a roasted vegetable salad and a quinoa dish. She was understanding but expressed that she felt disappointed not to be able to enjoy the main dish. I assured her that I would make it up to her and invited her over for a vegan-only dinner the following weekend.

During the dinner, I noticed that Sarah seemed a bit off and kept checking her phone, which distracted her from the evening. After a few minutes, I realized she was upset, so I gently asked if everything was okay. She admitted that she was still feeling hurt about the previous dinner and expressed her frustration over my mistake. I explained that it was an honest error and that I truly did not mean to disrespect her dietary choices. 

In the end, we had a heartfelt conversation, and I apologized again for the mix-up, assuring her that I would be more mindful in the future. We ended the night on a positive note, and I suggested we cook together next time to ensure her preferences are met.

So, AITA for mistakenly serving a non-vegan dish to my vegan friend and then trying to make it right?",457,809,0.91,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_88815,2023-09-13 00:00:00,NAH,1980,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been together for several years, and we recently moved in together. We both have our own hobbies and interests, and that's something I really appreciate about our relationship. Recently, I've been getting into gardening. I find it relaxing and rewarding, and I've enjoyed learning about different plants and how to take care of them.

My partner, on the other hand, is not a fan of gardening at all. They think it's a waste of time and would prefer to spend their weekends doing other activities like hiking or watching movies. While I respect their opinion, I really wanted to make our balcony a nice green space because it brings me joy.

I decided to start a small herb garden and some flowers. I made sure to keep all my gardening tools and supplies organized and out of the way. However, one day, my partner came home and saw the balcony filled with pots and soil. They were clearly upset and expressed that they didn’t want our living space to be cluttered and that the smell of the soil bothered them.

I apologized for not considering their feelings and offered to compromise by keeping the gardening to a minimum and only using one small section of the balcony. My partner appreciated my willingness to compromise but still felt that having plants at all was too much.

We ended up having a long discussion about our hobbies and the importance of having our own spaces and interests. I realized that while gardening is important to me, I also value my partner’s comfort. We agreed to find a balance where I can have my little garden while ensuring it doesn’t interfere too much with our shared space.

In the end, I feel that we both handled the situation well by communicating openly, and I'm pleased that we reached a compromise. Am I the Asshole?",859,2114,0.64,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_94646,2019-01-29 00:00:00,NAH,1780,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I definitely messed up, and I'm trying to understand if I'm completely in the wrong here or if there's more to it. 

So, last week, my roommate and I decided to throw a small dinner party. We invited a few friends over, and I was excited to host. One of our friends, Rachel, is vegetarian, and I made sure to prepare a few vegetarian dishes for her. However, during the dinner, I also made a pasta dish with sausage, which I thought would be a hit.

As the night went on, Rachel seemed a bit off. When I asked her if everything was okay, she hesitated and then mentioned that she felt uncomfortable with the sausage dish being the main attraction, as it overshadowed the vegetarian options I made. I didn't mean to upset her; in my mind, I thought it was just a casual dinner with a variety of food. I apologized, but she seemed really hurt and ended up leaving early.

The next day, I reached out to her to talk things over. I told her that I appreciated her feedback and that I genuinely didn’t mean to prioritize one dish over another. I also explained that I wanted to provide a variety of options because I thought everyone would enjoy it. She replied that she understood and appreciated my effort, but it still stung that the non-vegetarian dish took center stage.

I told her I would keep her feelings in mind for future gatherings, but I still felt a bit defensive because I genuinely thought I was being considerate. I wasn't intentionally trying to offend her, but I do understand that my actions might have come off that way.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I (28F) have a close friend, Sarah (27F), who recently started a new job. I was really excited for her and wanted to celebrate her achievement, so I organized a small gathering at my place last weekend. I invited a few mutual friends, and we all agreed to bring snacks and drinks.

On the day of the gathering, Sarah mentioned she was feeling a bit anxious about the new job. She said she was having a hard time adjusting to the office culture and was worried that she might not fit in. I wanted to be supportive, so I encouraged her to talk about it and reassured her that it was completely normal to feel that way.

During the gathering, while everyone was chatting and having a good time, I thought it might be helpful to have a more serious conversation with Sarah to help her feel better. I asked her to share more about her experience, hoping that our friends could offer some advice or encouragement. However, as I began to steer the conversation in that direction, I noticed some of our other friends looking uncomfortable and trying to change the subject.

I didn't mean to put Sarah on the spot, but I thought it was important for her to feel supported. Eventually, she seemed overwhelmed and said she just wanted to enjoy the evening and not focus on work. I felt bad and immediately backtracked, trying to lighten the mood again.

Afterward, Sarah texted me saying she appreciated my concern but felt like I had made her uncomfortable by bringing up her job in front of everyone. I apologized and explained that my intentions were good, but I can see how it might have come off differently. I feel like I might have overstepped, but I genuinely wanted to help her.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently went to a family gathering where everyone was excited to see each other after a long time. My cousin has a young daughter, Mia, who is about five years old. She was really looking forward to spending time with her cousins, and my cousin was talking about how Mia gets shy around new people, but she really enjoys being outside and playing games.

During the gathering, my cousin suggested that we all play a game of soccer in the backyard. The weather was nice, and everyone was eager to join in. I noticed that Mia was sitting on the sidelines, looking a bit overwhelmed by all the older kids running around. I thought it would be nice to include her, so I walked over and asked if she wanted to play. She looked excited but also nervous, so I encouraged her by saying we could form teams where she would be included, and I offered to let her be on my team.

As we started playing, I made sure to pass the ball to her whenever possible, and I cheered her on when she kicked, even if it didn’t go far. I wanted her to feel confident and have fun. However, as the game progressed, I noticed that the older kids were quite competitive and started running past her without really taking her into account. I felt a bit frustrated with them for not being more mindful. At one point, when Mia was about to kick the ball, one of the older kids barreled in and kicked it away from her, which made her really upset. 

I quickly took a moment to gather everyone and reminded them that we were there to have fun and enjoy the time together, and that we should be considerate of how Mia feels. After that, the older kids started to include her more, and we all managed to have a great time playing together. 

After the game, I felt a bit torn because I didn’t want to come off as a buzzkill to the older kids, but I also wanted to make sure that Mia felt included and happy.

No one is the Asshole,"I (28f) have a great relationship with my brother (30m), but we sometimes clash over our different lifestyles. I live a fairly minimalist lifestyle and try to reduce clutter in my life, while he enjoys collecting things, especially action figures and memorabilia from his favorite movies and games. 

Last weekend, I invited him over for a movie night. I wanted to keep the atmosphere cozy and chill, so I set up a comfortable space with some snacks and drinks. I knew he would bring his collection of action figures to display during the night, which he loves to do, but I wasn't entirely thrilled about it. I have a cat who loves to knock things over, and I was worried about the potential chaos. 

When he arrived, I mentioned my concerns about his action figures getting damaged or knocked over and suggested we keep them safely in a box during the movie. I wanted to avoid any accidents and also keep the space feeling relaxed and clutter-free. He was visibly disappointed and said he had been looking forward to showing them off. I realized I might have come off as dismissive, so I suggested we could set them up on a high shelf out of reach but still visible.

He reluctantly agreed, but throughout the night, I could tell he was still a bit upset. During the movie, he seemed distracted and didn't engage as much as usual. When I asked if he was okay, he said he was just frustrated because he felt like I didn’t appreciate his hobby. I apologized and told him that wasn’t my intention; I just wanted to protect his collection and keep the space tidy.

We ended up having a good time, but I still felt bad about the initial tension. I think I was looking out for his stuff, but I also understand how important his collection is to him.

She’s incredibly talented, and I’m really proud of her. However, as her big sister, I also felt a sense of responsibility to help her avoid some pitfalls in the business world, since I’ve been working in marketing for a few years now.

When she launched her brand, I offered to help her with her social media presence, thinking it would be a great way for us to bond and for me to share my knowledge. She was all for it at first, but as we started working together, I noticed that she seemed to be getting frustrated with my suggestions. I tend to be quite detail-oriented and had a lot of ideas on how to improve her marketing strategy. I thought I was being helpful, but she felt like I was taking over and not letting her express her own vision.

After a few heated discussions, we decided to take a step back and have a candid conversation. During that talk, she opened up about how she wanted to keep her brand true to herself without feeling like she was under pressure to conform to “professional” standards. I realized that while I had good intentions, I was unintentionally making her feel overwhelmed and stifled. We agreed that I would support her without imposing my ideas, and she would reach out for help when she needed it.

Now, we’re both much happier with the arrangement. She’s able to grow her brand in her own way, and I’m there to cheer her on from the sidelines. Some of our mutual friends think I should have just let her take the lead from the beginning, but I genuinely wanted to help her succeed.

She had put a lot of effort into it and was excited to show it off to everyone. During the event, my cousin had prepared a variety of delicious baked goods for us to sample, and everything was going really well.

As the evening went on, I noticed that my aunt, who has a gluten intolerance, was struggling to find something she could eat. I felt bad for her and wanted to help, so I quietly offered her some gluten-free snacks that I had brought along, just in case. My cousin overheard this and immediately looked upset; she thought I was undermining her hard work and showcasing my own snacks instead of supporting her bakery.

I tried to explain that I wasn’t trying to take attention away from her—rather, I just wanted my aunt to feel included and enjoy something too. My cousin was still frustrated, saying that she wanted to be the one to provide everything for our family’s gathering and that it was her moment to shine.

After some back and forth, we both ended up feeling upset, but later in the evening, we sat down to talk it out. I told her how proud I was of her and her bakery, and she acknowledged that it was a tough situation but appreciated my intentions. We both apologized to each other, and by the end of the night, things were back to normal.

Some relatives later mentioned to me that I shouldn’t have offered my snacks, while others said it was thoughtful of me. I feel like neither of us was in the wrong; we were just trying to look out for my aunt in our own ways. AITA?

Last week, I invited her to a small gathering at my house with a few close friends, hoping it would lift her spirits and give her a chance to socialize.

The night of the gathering, Sarah arrived and seemed a bit distant. I noticed she was quiet and not engaging much with others, which is unusual for her. I thought maybe she just needed some time to warm up, so I tried to encourage her to join in the conversations. At one point, I made a joke about how we were all just a little too introverted for our own good, hoping it would lighten the mood. 

Unfortunately, one of our mutual friends, Tom, made a comment that “if you can’t handle being social, maybe you should just stay home.” It was meant as a joke, but I could see Sarah visibly flinch. I quickly responded, saying that everyone has their own struggles and that it’s okay to have off days. I didn’t want her to feel singled out or judged, especially since I knew how much effort she put into coming out.

After a while, Sarah excused herself and went home. I later reached out to her to check in, and she mentioned that Tom’s comment really hurt her feelings, even if it was meant to be light-hearted. I felt terrible for not shutting it down more firmly in the moment. I also talked to Tom later, and he didn’t mean any harm but admitted he didn’t really think about how his words might affect someone dealing with anxiety.

He has two young kids from a previous marriage, and while I've grown to care for them a lot, I know their mom (his ex-wife) is still a huge part of their lives. She passed away unexpectedly last year, which has been really tough for everyone involved.

I’ve been making an effort to support my partner and his kids through this challenging time. We often talk about their memories of her, and I encourage them to express their feelings. The kids and I have also started doing some activities together, like painting and baking, which they seem to enjoy.

Recently, the kids expressed a desire to have a memorial for their mom in the backyard, something special they can visit and remember her by. They asked me if I could help them create a small garden with flowers and a decorative stone with her name on it. I thought this was a beautiful idea and jumped at the chance to help them honor her memory.

However, when I brought the idea to my partner, he seemed hesitant. He said he felt it might be too soon and that he wasn't ready to have a physical reminder of their mom in the backyard, as it could evoke too many painful feelings for him. I completely understand where he’s coming from, but I also want to support the kids in their need to remember their mom and heal.

We ended up having a long discussion, and I assured him that we could take it slow and that I wouldn’t push him into anything he wasn't comfortable with. In the end, we agreed to revisit the idea in a few months, allowing everyone some time to process their grief in their own way.

Here's where things get tricky. My sister has always been a bit of a perfectionist, and as she plans her wedding, she’s also getting really stressed about everything being “just right.” She asked me to be her maid of honor, which I was honored to accept. However, she has started to impose a lot of expectations on me regarding the planning. She wants me to be involved in every detail, from choosing the flowers to picking out the bridesmaid dresses.

I’ve expressed to her that while I want to support her, I also have a demanding job and some personal commitments that mean I can’t be as available as she’d like. I told her that I can help with specific tasks but need to maintain some boundaries to avoid burning out. 

Unfortunately, she took it personally and accused me of not caring about her wedding. This really hurt because I do care! I just don’t want to be overwhelmed or feel pressured. 

I’m stuck in a tough position. I don’t want to let her down, but I also don’t want to compromise my own well-being. I was thinking about having a heart-to-heart with her and explaining how I feel, but I don’t want her to think I'm being unsupportive.

The new tenant is a single parent with a toddler, and I completely understand that kids can be noisy. However, the noise level has been quite high, especially during late hours. My apartment has thin walls, so it’s hard not to hear the constant running, yelling, and sometimes crying that goes on. I can appreciate that parenting is tough, especially with a young child, but the late-night commotion has made it difficult for me to get a good night's sleep.

After a couple of weeks of sleepless nights, I decided to approach my neighbor. I knocked on their door and politely explained my situation, expressing that I completely understand parenting can be overwhelming and that I don’t want to be a bad neighbor, but the noise has been disruptive at night. I suggested they might consider trying to keep the volume down a bit during those late hours.

No one is the Asshole,"Background:

I'm a 25-year-old woman, and I have a close-knit group of friends from college. Recently, one of my friends, Sarah (24f), announced that she is getting married to her boyfriend of two years. We’re all really happy for her, but the wedding planning process has brought some unexpected tension among our group. Sarah has chosen a very specific theme for her wedding that revolves around her favorite color and a vintage aesthetic, which is lovely, but also quite different from what most of the group envisioned for her.

Issue:

As the wedding date approaches, Sarah has been asking for input from all of us regarding her bridal party and the overall wedding details. I voiced my opinion about wanting to incorporate some modern elements that I think would complement her theme and make it more relatable to our friends. I suggested a few ideas like a fun photo booth with props and some upbeat music to balance out the vintage vibe. Sarah seemed taken aback and told me that she really doesn’t want any modern touches and prefers to keep everything strictly in line with her vision.

I didn’t mean to push too hard, but I guess my enthusiasm came off as disrespectful. My other friends chimed in, and it created a bit of a divide—some agreed with me, while others sided with Sarah, saying she should stick to her original plan. This led to a group chat that got a bit heated, with everyone feeling like they had to pick sides.

After talking to Sarah one-on-one, I realized she was feeling overwhelmed with the planning and just wanted to make her dream wedding come true. I apologized for pushing my ideas too hard and offered to help her with the planning in any way she felt comfortable. Sarah appreciated the apology, but the tension among our friend group is still there, and I feel bad for contributing to it.

Now I’m left wondering if my desire to share my thoughts and help was overstepping. I didn’t want to hurt her feelings, but I also wanted to make sure her wedding would be enjoyable for everyone.

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been dating for about a year, and we decided to host a small dinner party for some of our close friends. We wanted to create a warm and inclusive atmosphere, so we asked everyone to bring a dish that represents their cultural background.

One of our friends, Alex, is vegan and very passionate about animal rights. When I asked him what he would like to bring, he mentioned that he wanted to make a vegan lasagna. I thought that was a great idea, as it would add variety to the meal. However, I also wanted to serve a traditional Italian lasagna, as my family recipe is a staple in my household, and I was excited to share it with everyone.

As the dinner party approached, I decided to make both lasagnas. I thought it would be nice for everyone to have options, and I made sure to label the dishes clearly so that no one would mix them up. I also shared with Alex that I would be making the traditional lasagna and made sure to let him know that I respect his dietary choices.

On the day of the dinner, everything was going well until Alex arrived. He immediately noticed the non-vegan lasagna and looked visibly upset. He expressed that he felt uncomfortable having it at the table and that it was disrespectful to serve something that went against his values. I apologized and explained that my intention was to offer variety and that I was not trying to disrespect his choices.

The conversation became somewhat tense, and while I assured him that I would not force anyone to eat it, he said he felt it was inappropriate for me to have made it at all. I felt stuck because I wanted to honor my cultural tradition while also being respectful of my friend’s feelings.

In the end, we all enjoyed the dinner, and Alex did have a chance to eat the vegan lasagna. However, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the evening had been somewhat awkward due to the initial disagreement.

On this particular day, the shop was quite crowded, and I managed to grab a small table near the window. After ordering my coffee, I noticed a man in his early 40s looking around for a place to sit. He seemed a bit uncomfortable, and I could tell he was hoping to find a spot to work as well.

After a few minutes, I decided to speak up. I said, “Hey, if you’re looking for a place to sit, I don’t mind sharing this table. It’s kind of small, but we could both fit.” He looked surprised but grateful, so he joined me. We exchanged pleasantries, and I went back to my writing.

About half an hour later, the guy suddenly started talking about his job, which seemed to be a demanding corporate position. He shared some stories that were kind of negative, and the vibe started to get a bit tense. I tried to steer the conversation into lighter topics, but he kept bringing it back to his frustrations. At one point, he complained about how people in his office just didn’t understand his perspective, and I could tell he was venting.

I felt bad for him but also a bit overwhelmed since I just wanted to focus on my work. I gently said, “I’m sorry you’re dealing with that, but I hope you don’t mind if I get back to my writing for a bit.” He seemed taken aback and said, “Oh, sure, I didn’t mean to interrupt your work.” He then went silent, and I felt a wave of awkwardness wash over us.

After a few minutes of silence, he got up, thanked me for sharing the table, and left. I felt a bit guilty for cutting him off, but I also felt like I had set a boundary. I just wanted to focus on my writing without feeling bad for not engaging in a conversation that was dragging me down.

Now I’m wondering if I could have handled that better. I certainly didn’t intend to come off as rude, but I also felt like I needed to prioritize my own space and work. So, Reddit, AITA for asking him to let me focus on my writing?",962,2293,0.92,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_45816,2023-03-30 00:00:00,NAH,2243,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"First time poster here, and I'm in a bit of a dilemma with my best friend. We've been friends for over a decade, and we have always supported each other in our personal lives. Recently, he decided to quit his stable job to pursue his passion for painting full-time. While I admire his courage and understand that following your dreams is important, I can't help but feel concerned for him. 

He has always been a bit impulsive, and I worry that he hasn’t fully thought through the financial implications of this decision. I voiced my concerns to him, and I suggested he might want to keep a part-time job while he builds his painting career. I didn’t want to discourage him, but I felt like a voice of reason. Unfortunately, he took my advice as a lack of support and got really upset.

Now, things feel awkward between us. I want to be there for him and support his passion, but I also feel it's my responsibility as a friend to look out for him. I’ve been trying to give him space, but I can't shake the feeling that I might have overstepped.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently had a situation with my roommate that I think is worth sharing. We’ve been living together for about a year now, and for the most part, we get along really well. However, there’s one thing that has been bothering both of us lately.

My roommate is really passionate about cooking, and he often experiments with new recipes. I admire his enthusiasm, but he tends to cook at odd hours, often late at night. This wouldn’t be a problem, except that I have a pretty strict work-from-home schedule and need to get up early every day.

One night, he decided to try making a complicated dish at around 10 PM. The kitchen was filled with strong smells, and the noise of pots and pans was a bit disruptive. I politely asked if he could possibly save his cooking for earlier in the day, especially since it was getting late and I needed to focus on my work in the morning.

He seemed taken aback and said that he thought it was fine to cook whenever he wanted and that he didn’t realize it bothered me. I clarified that I wasn’t trying to control his cooking, but just asking for a little consideration regarding the timing.

After a brief discussion, we both agreed that we should communicate better about our schedules and respect each other's needs. He apologized for not being more aware, and I reassured him that I didn’t want to stifle his passion for cooking. We ended up finding a compromise where he could cook evenings when I didn’t have to work the next day.

In the end, I think we both learned to be more mindful of each other’s routines without anyone being at fault. So, I’m wondering if I’m in the wrong for bringing it up, or if it was a fair request considering our living situation.",64,1723,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_25197,2020-03-17 00:00:00,NAH,1701,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Throwaway account for privacy reasons.

So I (35m) have a younger brother, Tom (28m), who has been struggling to find his footing post-college. He graduated during the pandemic and has faced a lot of challenges in the job market. I’ve tried to support him as best as I can, both emotionally and financially when necessary, but it’s been tough for him, and I understand that it’s not easy.

Recently, Tom started dating a girl named Lisa (26f), whom I’ve met a couple of times. She seems nice and supportive, and it seemed like they had a good relationship. However, I noticed that Tom had started to isolate himself from friends and family since they got together. I mentioned this to him casually, hoping he’d consider spending more time with us, but he brushed it off, saying he was happy and that I just didn’t understand his new relationship.

Fast forward a few weeks, and I got a call from one of our mutual friends, Mark. He was worried about Tom and told me that Lisa had been controlling and manipulative, making Tom feel guilty about spending time away from her and even questioning his friendships. I was really concerned, so I decided to reach out to Tom.

When I expressed my concerns, Tom got defensive. He said I was trying to interfere in his relationship and that Lisa was just looking out for him. I felt frustrated because I genuinely cared about his well-being, but I didn’t want to push him away further. I suggested that we all hang out together, just to help him see that it was okay to have a balance in his life.

To my surprise, Lisa was open to it. We planned a game night with a few friends, and at first, it seemed to go well. However, during the night, Lisa started making passive-aggressive comments about Tom's friendships and how they were “wasting his time.” It escalated when Tom pointed out her behavior, and she snapped at him, resulting in an awkward silence.

After the game night, Tom called me, upset that I had ""humiliated"" Lisa in front of everyone. I tried to explain that my intention was never to hurt her or him, but simply to help create a safe space for him. However, he felt that I had crossed a line and told me he needed some space from me.

I’m worried about Tom, but I don’t think I did anything wrong by trying to help him see what was happening. I reached out to apologize for any misunderstandings, but I’m unsure if I should continue to press the issue or let him figure things out on his own. 

In the end, I want what’s best for him, and I hope we can mend our relationship without me being perceived as the bad guy.",382,1769,0.99,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_83520,2023-10-24 00:00:00,NAH,2576,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been living together for about a year now, and we both share a passion for cooking. Recently, we decided to host a dinner party for our friends, and we wanted to prepare a few homemade dishes together. We each made a list of recipes we wanted to try: I suggested a classic lasagna, a homemade garlic bread, and a rich chocolate cake. My partner wanted to make a curry, a quinoa salad, and a panna cotta for dessert. 

As we began planning, we quickly realized that our cooking styles and preferences were quite different. I love Italian cuisine and comfort food, while my partner leans more toward Mediterranean and Asian flavors. During a particularly hectic week, my partner suggested we compromise by making a fusion meal that combined elements from both of our lists, which at first sounded great to me.

However, as we started to discuss the details, I noticed that my partner wanted to completely replace my lasagna with their curry. I felt attached to my choices, especially since lasagna was one of my family's signature dishes growing up. I suggested we keep the lasagna and perhaps make a smaller portion of the curry instead, but my partner was disappointed and felt I wasn't being open to their ideas. 

We ended up in a small argument about it, with both of us feeling frustrated. I didn't want to dismiss their cooking preferences, but I also wanted to honor my own traditions. Eventually, we decided to keep both the lasagna and the curry, along with a small selection of the other dishes we had chosen. 

In the end, our dinner party was a success, and everyone enjoyed the variety of food we prepared together. Looking back, I wonder if I should have been more flexible with my partner's suggestions, but I also feel that my attachment to my family's recipes is valid. Am I the asshole for wanting to stick to my original dish?",573,1497,0.99,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_21023,2024-09-11 00:00:00,NAH,1866,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"For context, my partner and I decided to host a small dinner party for our close friends to celebrate the new year. We wanted it to be a fun evening with good food, drinks, and lots of laughter. Since we were hosting, we offered to provide the main dishes, but we also encouraged our friends to bring something to share, whether it be an appetizer, dessert, or drinks. 

One of our friends, Sarah, is a single mom and has been going through a rough patch financially. She mentioned to me that she wasn’t sure if she could bring anything because money is tight. I totally understood and reassured her that it was no problem at all. I told her just to come and enjoy the evening, and that her presence was what mattered most.

As the party approached, I noticed that Sarah seemed a bit anxious about the gathering. I decided to reach out to her again and said that if she felt okay, she could bring a small dessert or even just some drinks. I wanted her to know that we weren’t expecting anything extravagant, but just a little something to contribute. 

On the night of the dinner, Sarah showed up with a homemade cake that she had baked herself. It wasn’t fancy, but you could tell she put a lot of effort into it. Everyone loved the cake and appreciated the gesture. However, I could see that she looked a bit uncomfortable, and I later found out that she had exhausted her budget to make it.

After the party, I felt a mix of emotions. I was glad everyone had a great time and that Sarah’s cake was a hit, but I also felt guilty for not realizing how much of a stretch it was for her to bring something. I wish I had insisted she come without the burden of bringing anything. 

Now, I'm left wondering if I should have handled the situation differently. Was it wrong for me to suggest she bring something when I knew she was struggling financially?

We’ve been through a lot together, and I really value our friendship. Recently, Sarah started dating Mike (30s, male), and while I’m happy for her, things have been a bit tense.

Last weekend, Sarah invited me to her birthday party, which Mike was also attending. I was excited to celebrate with her, but I noticed that Mike seemed off. He was quiet and kept checking his phone, which made me feel uncomfortable. During the party, Sarah was busy mingling, and I ended up sitting with Mike for a while.

When I asked if everything was okay, he opened up about feeling overwhelmed with work and some personal issues. I listened and offered support, but at some point, I made a lighthearted joke about how he should take a break and enjoy life more. He took it the wrong way and snapped at me, saying I didn’t understand what he was going through.

Sarah overheard this and immediately came over, looking upset. She defended Mike and told me I should be more sensitive to his feelings. I tried to explain that I was just trying to lighten the mood, but the tension escalated. Mike left the party early, and Sarah was visibly upset with me.

Afterward, I felt terrible for causing such a rift. I care about both of them and didn’t mean to come between them. I reached out to Sarah to apologize, but she said she needed time to process what happened. I understand that I may have misjudged the situation and wasn’t as sensitive as I should have been, but I also feel like it was a misunderstanding.

No one is the Asshole,"I posted this on another sub but felt the need to add it here.

A few months ago, my partner, Jamie, and I decided to host a small gathering with a few close friends. We wanted it to be a relaxed evening filled with good food and conversation. We both enjoy cooking, so we planned a nice dinner together. 

As the date approached, Jamie had a lot on their plate with work and other commitments. I noticed they were becoming increasingly stressed, so I offered to take on more of the preparation for the dinner. Jamie agreed, and I went ahead and planned the menu, shopped for groceries, and even started cooking the day before the gathering.

The day of the event arrived, and I had everything ready. When our friends came over, they were really impressed with the food and the atmosphere. However, I could tell Jamie was still feeling overwhelmed. They weren’t as engaged in the conversation as usual, and I felt a bit bad because I wanted them to enjoy the evening too.

After our friends left, I asked Jamie how they felt about the night. They told me that while they appreciated everything I did, they wished I had involved them more in the planning and cooking process. They felt a bit sidelined and worried that I took over without considering their feelings. I was surprised because my intention was to help them relax, but I realized that I might have inadvertently made them feel excluded.

We had a good conversation about it, and I understand now that I need to communicate better in the future and make sure we’re both on the same page when it comes to planning things together. 

So Reddit, am I the asshole for trying to take over the dinner preparations to alleviate my partner’s stress, or is Jamie justified in feeling left out? I care about them and want to make sure we handle these situations better in the future.

No one is the Asshole,"I (27F) work in a small team at my job, and we've all become pretty close over the last couple of years. Recently, one of my coworkers (28M) has been going through a tough time. He’s dealing with some personal issues, and I've noticed he’s been a bit withdrawn. While I’m not super close with him, I do care about his well-being and want to support him.

One day, I decided to invite him out for lunch, thinking it might help him feel better to talk about things. I approached him in the break room and asked if he wanted to grab some food. He seemed surprised but agreed. During lunch, I tried to keep the conversation light, but eventually, I asked if he wanted to share what was bothering him. He looked uncomfortable and said he wasn’t ready to talk about it yet, but he appreciated the offer.

I completely understood and changed the subject, making sure he knew there was no pressure to open up. After lunch, he thanked me for the invite and said he really appreciated my concern.

Later that day, I found out from another coworker that he was upset about me asking him to lunch. Apparently, he felt that it was inappropriate for me to push him to talk about his problems when he wasn't ready. I honestly didn't mean to overstep; I just wanted to show support. I felt bad knowing he was uncomfortable because that was never my intention. 

I considered reaching out to apologize, but I also didn’t want to make it worse by bringing it up again. So now I’m wondering, did I go too far by inviting him out and asking if he wanted to talk? Was I wrong to try to help in the first place? I just wanted to be a good coworker and friend.

UPDATE: I did reach out to him with a sincere apology, explaining my intentions were good and that I respect his boundaries. He appreciated the apology and said he misunderstood my intentions.

No one is the Asshole,"I work as a high school teacher and I’ve always been supportive of my students’ aspirations. Recently, I had a conversation with a senior student named Jenna who expressed her passion for art and her dream of attending a prestigious art school after graduation. I encouraged her and let her know that she has talent and should pursue her dreams.

A few weeks later, I was invited to an art exhibition organized by local students, including Jenna. I was excited to see her work and support her. When I arrived, I noticed that there were quite a few students and parents, and the atmosphere was warm and encouraging. Jenna’s artwork was displayed prominently, and I was proud of her achievement.

As I was mingling and looking at the other pieces, I overheard some parents discussing how they thought some students were a bit too ambitious, suggesting that not everyone could make it in the art world. I felt compelled to speak up and defend Jenna and the other artists, so I casually joined the conversation and shared how important it is to support students in their passions, regardless of the odds. I mentioned Jenna specifically and how her talent was extraordinary.

Afterward, I saw Jenna standing alone, looking a bit disheartened. I approached her and told her how impressed I was with her work and that she shouldn't listen to any negativity from the parents. I encouraged her to keep pursuing her art, even if some people doubted her.

A few days later, Jenna thanked me and shared that my words meant a lot to her, but I also found out that some of the parents felt that I had overstepped by calling out their opinions and thought my involvement was inappropriate. They felt I should have let them express their concerns without interjecting.

No one is the Asshole,"A few weeks ago, I hosted a small game night at my apartment with some friends. We had a fun time playing board games, and as the night progressed, we decided to play a game where we had to come up with funny fictional stories based on prompts. The atmosphere was light-hearted and everyone was enjoying themselves.

One of my friends, let’s call him Jake, has a great sense of humor, but he tends to be a bit of a jokester and sometimes goes too far. During one round, I decided to share a story about a fictional character getting lost in a ridiculous situation at a grocery store. I thought it was hilarious and everyone was laughing, including Jake.

Then, for his turn, Jake decided to tackle a prompt about relationships. He started telling a story that went on a bit too long and started making jokes about how people in relationships can be needy and clingy. As he went deeper into the story, it became uncomfortable for one of our friends, Sarah, who had just gotten out of a tough relationship. I could see her visibly getting upset, so I tried to gently steer Jake away from that topic by jokingly saying, “Alright, that’s enough relationship advice for one night!”

Jake didn’t take the hint, though, and continued to push the envelope. I could tell that Sarah was really hurt, and I felt responsible for not stepping in more forcefully. Eventually, I interrupted him more seriously and said, “Dude, let’s give Sarah a break, she’s not in the mood for this.” Jake finally realized he had gone too far and apologized.

Afterward, I checked in with Sarah to see if she was okay. She appreciated my concern and said she was fine, but she admitted that Jake's jokes had struck a nerve. We ended the night on a good note, but there was definitely some tension.

Looking back, I feel like I handled the situation as best as I could, trying to balance the fun with being considerate of my friends' feelings.

I prepared a nice meal and set up the dining area to create a cozy atmosphere for everyone. I invited three friends: Sarah, who is a vegetarian; Mark, who is gluten-free; and Jenna, who has no dietary restrictions. I made sure to accommodate Sarah and Mark by preparing a vegetarian gluten-free pasta dish, along with a side salad and some garlic bread.

The day of the dinner, just a few hours before everyone was set to arrive, I received a text from Mark saying he wouldn't be able to make it because he got caught up with work. I was disappointed but understood that things come up. However, just as I was finishing up the meal prep, Jenna texted me asking if she could bring her boyfriend, Tom, whom I hadn't met before. I was fine with it and said sure, the more the merrier.

When Jenna and Tom arrived, I greeted them and we sat down to eat. During dinner, I noticed that Tom had a few dietary restrictions of his own that I hadn't anticipated. Tom was allergic to nuts and also avoided dairy, which I hadn’t known about prior. I felt a little bad because I had used some pesto in the pasta that contained pine nuts and also had some cheese on the garlic bread. I offered him some salad and extra breadsticks, but he declined, saying he was okay with just the salad.

After dinner, we moved to the living room for dessert, where I had prepared a chocolate cake. I had also made sure to have some fruit as an option for everyone. When I pulled out the cake, Tom expressed that he couldn't eat it due to having a dairy allergy, and he looked a bit disappointed. I felt terrible for not considering his dietary needs, even though I had a lot on my plate already with the original preparations. 

As the evening went on, I could sense some tension. Tom kept making comments about how it would have been great to have a dessert that everyone could enjoy, and I felt a bit defensive, thinking that I had done my best given the short notice and the unexpected guests.

At the end of the night, Jenna apologized on Tom's behalf, saying he didn't mean to come off as rude, but he was just used to being in situations where he had to advocate for his dietary needs. I appreciated her understanding, but I still felt a bit awkward about the whole situation.

In the heat of the moment, I told him that he needed to find his own interests instead of just tagging along with mine.

Later that night, my mom talked to me about it. She said I should have found a way to include him more and encouraged me to share my materials. I felt really bad because I didn't mean to hurt his feelings; I just wanted to focus on my painting. I apologized to him and offered to help him find a hobby he enjoys.

I still feel conflicted about my reaction. I wanted to stand my ground about needing my space for my art, but I also didn’t want to make him feel rejected. AITA for wanting to keep my space while painting?",459,1728,0.77,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_23352,2023-06-09 00:00:00,NAH,1516,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I recently hosted a dinner party for a few close friends, and I was excited to catch up with everyone. Among the guests was my friend Sarah, who has been in a polyamorous relationship for a couple of years with two partners, Mark and Jess. I’ve met both of them before, and they all seem to get along well.

When I sent out the invites, I made a point to ask Sarah if she wanted to bring both of her partners. I thought it would be fun to have them all together, but she mentioned she felt it would be easier for her to come alone this time. She said that sometimes, when they go out as a trio, it can be a bit overwhelming, and she just wanted to enjoy the evening without the added dynamic of both partners.

I understood her perspective and didn't pressure her to bring anyone else. On the day of the dinner, she arrived, and we had a great time catching up and enjoying the food. At one point, she brought up her relationship, and I asked how she felt about balancing time between both partners. She expressed that while each relationship is fulfilling, it can be challenging to manage everyone's expectations, especially when out in social settings.

By the end of the night, she thanked me for hosting and said she appreciated being able to just relax and enjoy the evening without feeling like she had to juggle multiple dynamics. I felt good about creating a comfortable space for her, and I hope to include all three of them in the future when they feel ready.

No one is the Asshole,"Okay, so here’s my situation. I’m a woman in my late twenties, and I have a younger brother, Jake, who is 21. We're pretty close, but we have different interests. I’ve always been into art and theater, while he’s passionate about sports and gaming. 

Recently, Jake has been planning a small get-together for his close friends to celebrate his birthday. He invited me, and I was excited to attend. However, he mentioned to me in passing that he wanted to do a video game tournament during the party. I’m not really into gaming, and I had a feeling I wouldn’t be much fun for him or his friends in that setting. 

I decided to talk to him about it. I suggested that maybe we could do something together before the tournament, like a small art activity where I could teach him and his friends some basics of drawing. I thought it could be a fun bonding experience, and I’d get to contribute something to the party. 

Jake wasn't really on board with my idea. He told me he appreciated the offer but that his friends were coming over specifically for the gaming tournament, and he didn’t want to change the plans last minute. I totally understood his perspective and didn’t want to take away from his celebration, so I dropped it. 

When the day of the party came, I went over and had a good time, but I mostly felt like an outsider. I cheered him and his friends on during the gaming tournament, but I didn’t participate much. Afterward, Jake thanked me for coming and said he was glad I was there, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I could have contributed more.

Now, I’m left wondering if I should have pushed my idea harder and if I’m the one who caused any distance by not being more involved in what he really wanted. WIBTA if I suggested a different way to celebrate next time, or should I just leave it be?",154,2481,0.82,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_55291,2019-08-21 00:00:00,NAH,1816,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Hi everyone! I’m in a bit of a tough situation and looking for some outside perspective. 

I have a younger sister, Mia, who is 25. Mia has always been a bit of a free spirit, and she has a close group of friends that I’ve known for years. One of her friends, Jake, has been a part of the group since high school and they’ve always had a playful, flirty friendship. 

Recently, Mia and Jake decided to take a more serious step in their relationship, which made me really happy for them. However, a couple of weeks ago, I found out that Jake had cheated on Mia at a party while they were together. Mia was devastated, and it broke my heart to see her so hurt.

After the incident, Mia decided to cut Jake out of her life completely, which I totally understood. The thing is, I’ve known Jake for a long time, and while what he did was awful, I also know he’s a good person who made a terrible mistake. He reached out to me to express how sorry he was and to ask for advice on how to make amends with Mia. 

I really didn’t want to hurt Mia further, but I also didn’t want to completely abandon Jake, who I believe is genuinely remorseful. I ended up meeting with him and we talked about how he could approach Mia to apologize and possibly make things right. I told him that if he really cares about her, he should be honest and give her the space she needs. 

When Mia found out I met with Jake, she was furious. She felt betrayed that I would even consider helping him after what he did. I tried to explain my perspective that people make mistakes and can learn from them, but she wasn't having it. Now, I’m feeling torn. I love my sister and want to support her, but I also believe in giving people a second chance when they truly regret their actions.

No one is the Asshole,"I (32F) recently hosted a small dinner gathering at my place with a few close friends (all late 20s to early 30s). It was a casual affair, and everyone was bringing a dish to share. I decided to make a big pot of my famous chili, which is a family recipe and always a hit.

The night of the dinner, I was busy prepping and cooking while my friends started arriving. One of my friends, Sarah, brought a beautiful homemade dessert, and I noticed she seemed a bit off when she arrived. I asked her if everything was okay, and she mentioned that she had just had a tough week, which I completely empathized with.

As the night went on, we were all chatting and enjoying each other's company. At one point, I noticed that Sarah wasn't eating much and seemed to be preoccupied. I asked her if she wanted to talk about what was bothering her, but she said she didn’t want to ruin the evening.

After dinner, while we were cleaning up, I overheard Sarah talking quietly to another friend about feeling overwhelmed with work and personal issues. I felt bad that she was struggling and not wanting to share it with the group. I decided to check in with her one more time and suggested that if she needed someone to talk to, I was there for her.

Sarah appreciated the offer but expressed that she felt guilty about burdening others with her problems. I gently encouraged her that friends are there to support each other and that it was okay to lean on us during tough times. She seemed to appreciate my concern, but I could tell she was still hesitant.

Later in the night, as we were sitting around the table, I brought up the idea of forming a monthly dinner group where we could all share not just food but also our lives, the highs and lows, and offer support. Everyone loved the idea, including Sarah, and it seemed to lift her spirits a bit.

After everyone left, I felt good about the evening and about being there for Sarah. However, I'm wondering if maybe I overstepped by pushing her to open up about her feelings when she clearly wasn’t ready to share. Did I make her uncomfortable by focusing on her issues during what was supposed to be a fun gathering?

No one is the Asshole,"I recently had a situation with my friend group that left me feeling a bit conflicted. We’ve been friends for years, and we often go out to eat together. Last week, we planned a dinner at a new restaurant, and I was really looking forward to it.

When the bill came, everyone decided to split it evenly, which I thought was fair since we had all shared appetizers and drinks. However, one of my friends, Mark, was quite upset. He had ordered a much more expensive entree and felt it wasn’t right for him to pay the same as everyone else. He expressed his frustration, claiming that it wasn't fair for him to subsidize our cheaper meals.

I felt really awkward because I understood his point, but I also thought it was a nice way to keep things simple and avoid any awkwardness over who ordered what. I tried to suggest we could pay for our individual meals, but Mark insisted on splitting it and felt left out when the group didn’t want to change the plan.

After dinner, I reached out to him to see how he was feeling and let him know I understood his frustration. He appreciated the gesture but still felt like the group should have acknowledged his feelings during the dinner. I really didn’t want to create tension between us, so I apologized and said I would support whatever decision he felt was best for future outings.

Now I’m questioning whether I should have been more assertive in changing the way we handled the bill or if I was right to go along with the group’s wishes. I genuinely appreciate my friends and want to keep things harmonious, but I also want to respect everyone’s feelings, including Mark’s.

We had invited some friends for a game night, and they were all excited to meet the new addition to our family. We informed them about the dog’s anxiety and asked them to give the dog some space when they arrived.

During the night, our friends were having fun, and the dog started to feel overwhelmed. Without thinking much, one of my friends went to pet the dog, which caused the dog to bark and retreat to a corner, clearly stressed. I immediately stepped in, telling my friend that we had asked everyone to respect the dog's space, and that this situation could have been avoided if they had listened.

After the game night, I felt terrible. My friend texted me, saying they felt bad for upsetting the dog and that they were just trying to be friendly. I apologized for being a bit harsh, but I reiterated that we were trying to create a calm environment for the dog. 

My partner thinks I was justified in wanting to protect the dog, while my friend said I could have handled it better.

Everyone was excited, and we were all looking forward to a weekend of hiking, cooking over the fire, and just enjoying nature together. However, just a few days before the trip, one of our friends, Mia, suddenly had to back out due to a family emergency. We all felt bad for her, and she insisted we still go and have a good time without her.

On the day of the trip, while we were setting up camp, I noticed we were all a bit quieter than usual. I suggested we send Mia some pictures throughout the weekend to keep her in the loop, and everyone agreed. The first night around the campfire, we shared stories and memories, but I could tell some of my friends were feeling guilty about having fun without Mia.

The next day, we decided to go on a hike, but as we were getting ready, I overheard a couple of friends expressing their discomfort about the trip without Mia. They felt it was disrespectful to enjoy ourselves while she was dealing with something difficult. I understood their feelings but also thought it was important to make the most of the situation and support each other through the fun we could have.

So, I suggested we dedicate some time during the hike to talking about our favorite memories with Mia and how much we missed her. It lightened the mood, and we ended up having a great time while still feeling connected to her.

After the trip, I found out that some friends felt I had pushed too hard for us to enjoy ourselves and that it was insensitive considering Mia’s situation. I didn’t mean to come off that way; I just wanted to balance having fun while also honoring our friend.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I (28f) recently had a bit of a situation with my cousin (27f) regarding our family Thanksgiving dinner. Our family usually has a big gathering at my parents' house, and everyone brings a dish. This year, I was tasked with making the dessert, which I love to do. I decided to make my famous pumpkin pie and a pecan pie because I know those are favorites.

A week before Thanksgiving, my cousin called me and said that she really wanted to bring dessert too. She mentioned that she had a new recipe for a chocolate cake that she was excited to try. I felt a little conflicted because I already had my desserts planned, but I didn’t want to hurt her feelings or make her feel like she couldn’t contribute. So, I told her it would be great if she brought her cake as well.

On Thanksgiving Day, when we were setting up the food, I noticed that my cousin had made a huge cake and didn’t bring any of the other desserts I had made. When I asked her where they were, she casually said she decided to focus solely on her cake because she thought everyone would prefer it. I felt a bit disappointed because I had put a lot of effort into my pies, and it seemed like she didn’t really care about the plans we had discussed.

During dinner, her cake was indeed very popular, and everyone raved about it. I was happy for her, but I also felt overshadowed. When I brought up my pies later, she just shrugged and said, ""Well, maybe next time!"" It stung a little because I felt like my contribution was dismissed.

After dinner, I decided to take my pies home instead of leaving them at the house. I texted my cousin afterward, acknowledging her cake was delicious and saying I hoped she wasn’t upset about my pies not being eaten. She replied that she was surprised I hadn’t left any behind since they were so good, but she seemed fine about it.

Looking back, I wonder if I should have insisted on sticking to the original plan and maybe brought my desserts anyway, even if she had expressed wanting to bring her cake.

Emma is pursuing a degree in graphic design and has been struggling a bit with her coursework. She’s always loved art and has a natural talent, but the academic side of things is a real challenge for her.

A couple of weeks ago, she called me in tears, feeling overwhelmed and questioning her choice of major. She mentioned that she was thinking about switching to a less demanding field, something like business, because she felt like she was drowning. I listened to her and, in a moment of enthusiasm, I shared my own experience from when I was in college. I told her how I faced similar challenges and how I managed to push through by seeking help from my professors and using resources like tutoring services. I tried to encourage her to stick with it, as I truly believe she has the talent to succeed if she doesn’t give up.

After our call, I wanted to show my support, so I bought her a subscription to an online design platform that I thought might help her improve her skills. I sent her a message to let her know, hoping it would lift her spirits. However, when she received it, she was upset. She felt like I was pushing her to continue with something she was unsure about instead of supporting her decision to explore other options. She said she appreciated the gift but felt like I wasn’t respecting her feelings and choice.

They said something along the lines of, ""I just need some time to breathe; can we not talk about this right now?""

I felt hurt and a bit dismissed, so I ended up saying, ""I just want to talk about this so we can resolve it; shutting down doesn’t help.""

During the evening, my aunt brought up the idea of organizing a family reunion next summer. She asked everyone for their input on possible locations and activities. 

As the conversation progressed, my cousin, who is also getting married soon, mentioned that she was considering a destination wedding. This sparked a debate among family members about whether the reunion should be at a local park or a more scenic destination, which would require travel for many. Some relatives were in favor of a local event to make it easier for everyone to attend, while others liked the idea of a destination reunion.

Feeling the need to contribute, I suggested that we could have a more budget-friendly local reunion this year and save the destination idea for next year when more people could potentially afford it. I thought this would be a good compromise that could satisfy those who wanted both options. 

Unfortunately, my suggestion didn’t sit well with some of my family members, particularly my aunt, who was really excited about the idea of a destination reunion. She felt I was dismissing her plans and that my suggestion took away from the energy of the idea she proposed.

No one is the Asshole,"This happened a few weeks ago, but it’s still causing some tension among my friends, so I figured I’d share and see what you all think.

I (30F) have a close friend named Alex (29M), who I've known for years. He’s a genuinely caring person but can be a bit oblivious at times. Recently, he invited a group of us over for a movie night at his place. I was really looking forward to it, but when I arrived, I was taken aback by how messy his apartment was. I’m talking piles of clothes, dishes stacked up in the sink, and fast food wrappers everywhere. 

I tried to ignore it at first and just enjoy the night, but as the evening went on, I found it hard to concentrate on the movie with the chaos surrounding us. Halfway through, I jokingly made a comment about needing a “cleaning fairy” to come and help Alex out. Everyone laughed, but Alex turned a bit red and said he’d been busy with work and just hadn’t gotten around to tidying up.

After the movie, I decided to help out. I figured I could organize a little while we chatted. I started picking up the trash and washing the dishes while he went to grab snacks for us. When he came back, he looked shocked but didn’t say anything. I spent about 30 minutes cleaning up a bit, just to make the place more comfortable for both of us.

When I finished, Alex looked around and seemed genuinely grateful. He said he appreciated the help and that he had been feeling overwhelmed with life. The rest of our friends who were there were a bit mixed in their responses; some thought it was nice, while others felt it was a bit patronizing. 

Eventually, Alex told me outside of the group that while he appreciated my help, he felt embarrassed that I had to clean up after him. He didn’t want me to think poorly of him, and I assured him that wasn’t my intention at all. I just wanted to make the evening more enjoyable for both of us.

Now, there’s a bit of awkwardness whenever we hang out. Some of our friends think I overstepped by cleaning without asking, while others think it was a kind gesture. I’m left wondering if I should have just let it be.

So, am I the asshole for cleaning Alex's place without asking?",660,2026,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_82080,2018-06-21 00:00:00,NAH,2161,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I (27F) recently went on a weekend trip with a group of friends, including my best friend (28F) and her partner (30M). We all decided to rent a cabin in the mountains to unwind and enjoy some nature. It was meant to be a fun, relaxing getaway.

As we settled into the cabin, I noticed that my best friend’s partner seemed a bit uncomfortable and distant. I assumed it was just a case of him being shy or not wanting to intrude on our girl time. Throughout the weekend, my friend and I spent a lot of time reminiscing and doing our usual bonding activities, which included chatting, cooking together, and playing games. 

While we were having a good time, I noticed my friend's partner often just sat quietly, not really engaging with the conversation or activities. At one point, he even retreated to the bedroom while we were playing a game, which made me feel a bit awkward. I wanted him to feel included, but I also didn't want to pressure him into joining if he didn’t want to.

On the last night of our trip, I decided to gently bring it up with my friend. I told her that while I loved spending time with her, I felt bad that her partner seemed a bit left out, and maybe we could try to include him better in our activities. My intention was to help create a more inclusive environment for everyone.

My friend reacted unexpectedly. She got upset and said that her partner is introverted and prefers to be on the sidelines sometimes; she felt I was overstepping by trying to ""fix"" something that wasn’t a problem for them. I apologized, explaining that I just wanted to ensure everyone felt comfortable and included. 

After a bit of back and forth, we agreed to disagree and moved on with our night. Ultimately, we had a great time, but I’ve been left wondering if I should have just kept my observations to myself without bringing it up.

When he’s at our house, he tends to help out a lot with cooking and cleaning, which my mom appreciates. However, I’ve noticed that he often takes it upon himself to rearrange things in the kitchen and living room. For example, he moved my favorite mug to a top shelf, and he decided to replace my usual snack with something healthier without asking me.

I understand he’s trying to contribute and be helpful, but it feels like he’s overstepping. I don’t want to seem ungrateful since he’s doing chores, but it makes me uncomfortable when he changes my stuff. It’s my home too, and I have my way of doing things.

So, I’m wondering if I would be the asshole if I talked to my mom about it and asked her to tell him to stop rearranging things and changing what I have in the kitchen?

No one is the Asshole,"I’ll try to keep this short. I have a close friend from high school who is getting married soon. We’ve been friends for over a decade, and while we’ve always had different opinions on certain topics, we generally get along really well.

About me: I am a passionate environmentalist and vegan. I love promoting sustainability and often engage in discussions about climate change and animal rights. I’ve taken part in local activism and pride myself on living a lifestyle that aligns with my values.

About my friend: She’s always been a bit more traditional. She loves cooking and often hosts dinners where she serves a variety of meats and dairy dishes. While she knows my views, she has never judged me for them, and I appreciate that about her. She’s even tried some vegan meals I’ve made, but it’s clear that she enjoys her cooking methods and lifestyle.

The issue: Her wedding is going to be a big, traditional affair with a sit-down dinner that includes multiple meat-centered courses. While I want to be there to support her, I’m worried about how I’ll feel surrounded by a meal that goes against my values. I don’t want to make a scene or draw attention to my dietary choices, especially on her special day. 

My concern is that if I go, I might feel uncomfortable or even overwhelmed by the food and the discussions that could arise about it. On the other hand, I really want to be there for her and celebrate this significant moment in her life. 

I’m considering talking to her about the wedding menu, but I don’t want to bring up any issues that could put her in an awkward position. I don’t want to come off as self-righteous or make her feel bad about her choices.

Jake has a close-knit group of friends from college, and they have a tradition of getting together every month for a game night. I’m totally on board with this; I think it’s great that he has strong friendships and enjoys spending time with them.

However, the problem arises when the game night falls on a date that we had previously planned for a weekend getaway. We had been looking forward to this trip for weeks, and I thought we were both excited about it. When I reminded him about our plans, he expressed that he really didn’t want to miss game night with his friends. I suggested that he could still go for a few hours and then join me later, but he felt that would be unfair to his friends and disrupt the flow of their night.

I understand how important these friendships are to him, but I also feel hurt that our getaway seems to take a backseat to it. We ended up having a long discussion about how to balance our time with friends and each other. I think we both want to make it work, but it was emotionally taxing trying to navigate the situation.

In the end, Jake decided to stay home for our trip, and we had a lovely time together. However, I can't shake the feeling that I might have come off as selfish for wanting him to prioritize our trip over his friends.

No one is the Asshole,"I (24F) recently had a situation with my best friend, Alex (25M), who I've known since high school. We’ve always been super close, sharing everything from personal struggles to life goals. Recently, we both moved to a new city for work and naturally started spending even more time together.

A few weeks ago, during one of our regular hangouts, Alex opened up about his feelings for me. He told me that he had developed a crush and wanted to explore a romantic relationship. I was taken aback because I genuinely saw him as my best friend, and I didn't want to jeopardize our friendship. I told him I appreciated his honesty and that I valued our friendship too much to rush into something that I wasn’t sure about. I explained that I wasn't in a place to date anyone right now, as I was focused on settling into my new job and life.

Alex took it surprisingly well, and we continued to hang out, keeping things as they were. However, I noticed that he seemed a bit distant over the next few weeks, and I worried that my response had hurt him more than I realized. One evening, I decided to talk to him about it. I asked if he was feeling okay and if he wanted to discuss his feelings further. He confessed that while he was trying to move on, it was difficult because of how close we still were. We both agreed that it was important to communicate openly, and he said he didn’t want to lose our friendship either.

After a lot of back-and-forth discussions, we came to a mutual understanding. We decided to take a step back from our usual hangouts for a little while, allowing both of us some space to process everything. It was a tough decision to make, but I truly believe it was for the best.

Now, we’re both learning to navigate this new dynamic. I want to support him as a friend, but I also want to respect his feelings and give him the time he needs to heal. We're both communicating regularly, but still keeping some distance to reflect on our friendship and feelings.

As a part of their way of coping, my partner decided they wanted to host a small memorial gathering with close family and friends to celebrate their grandmother's life. They wanted it to be a light-hearted event, filled with stories, memories, and even a few of her favorite dishes.

I thought this was a lovely idea and offered to help plan it. However, I was a bit taken aback when my partner suggested we also include a karaoke machine and play some upbeat music. I expressed my concern that it might not fit the somber mood and could come off as disrespectful to the memory of their grandmother.

My partner was hurt by my suggestion and explained that their grandmother loved to sing and would have enjoyed a joyful celebration. We ended up having a long discussion about what the event should look like, and we both agreed to incorporate both memories and some lighter elements.

A few weeks before the trip, one of my friends, Sarah, approached me with a concern. She recently found out she was pregnant and was worried about how she would manage camping in the wilderness during her first trimester. She really wanted to go but was feeling anxious about it. I completely understood her feelings. Camping can be unpredictable, and I can imagine how uncomfortable it might be for someone in her situation.

I suggested that we could modify our plans to make it easier for her. We could choose a campsite that's closer to amenities, like restrooms and running water, and bring more comfortable gear. I also offered to take on more of the cooking and planning to ease her burden. Sarah appreciated my efforts but ultimately decided she would feel more comfortable staying home this time and would rather not risk it.

After she made that decision, another friend, Mike, mentioned that he felt left out of the planning since he hadn’t really been involved in the initial discussions. He had some ideas for activities that he wanted to propose, but it was getting close to the trip, and I had already done a lot of the organizing. I felt bad that he felt this way, but we had already made plans based on what everyone agreed upon.

At the party, her husband took charge of the music and decorations, which was fine, but it turned into a bit of a chaotic scene. I saw my sister looking stressed while trying to keep everything together. At one point, I noticed the cake was running late, so I offered to help her manage things. I went to the kitchen, checked on the cake, and realized it was still in the fridge. I brought it out to the dining area, and when I returned, her husband was upset that I had taken over things.

He pulled me aside and expressed that I should have checked with him first before making any decisions. I understood his perspective but felt it was more important to make sure my sister had a good birthday and wasn’t overwhelmed. Later that evening, I casually mentioned to my sister that I thought it would be good for her to set some boundaries with her husband, especially when it came to family events.

About six months ago, my partner lost their job due to company downsizing, which understandably caused a lot of stress. I wanted to be supportive, so I encouraged them to take their time finding a new job and to focus on self-care during this transition. However, as the weeks turned into months, I started feeling overwhelmed. I was the sole breadwinner, working long hours to keep everything afloat. 

My partner began to feel more and more hopeless about their job search, which led to them withdrawing emotionally. They would spend hours in their room, not engaging in activities they used to enjoy, like cooking or going for walks. I tried to initiate conversations, but they often responded with frustration or a lack of interest, which made me feel helpless and disconnected.

One evening, after a particularly long day at work, I came home to find the house a mess and my partner still in their pajamas. This pushed me over the edge, and I expressed my frustration about how I felt I was carrying the weight of everything while they seemed to be giving up. I didn’t yell, but I was firm in saying that we needed to work together to get through this. My partner was hurt by my words and felt that I didn’t understand how difficult things were for them.

That night, we ended up having a long conversation where we both shared our feelings. I admitted I was stressed and worried about our future, while they expressed their feelings of inadequacy and frustration at not being able to find a job.

I’m a college student, and my roommate and I have been living together for about a year now. We get along pretty well, but we have different schedules and lifestyles. I tend to be more of a night owl, often studying late into the night, while she’s an early bird who likes to get up and start her day by 6 AM.

Recently, my roommate decided to start studying for her upcoming exams in the early hours, which is totally fine. The issue began when she started waking up earlier and earlier, turning on the lights in our shared living space, and playing music to help her wake up. This disrupted my late-night studying and sleep, and I found myself getting increasingly frustrated.

After a few days of this, I decided to talk to her. I approached it by explaining how her early wake-up routine was affecting my ability to study and sleep. I suggested a compromise, like using headphones for her music and keeping the lights dimmed until she left for her classes. She seemed receptive and agreed to try it out.

However, a couple of days later, I noticed she was back to her old routine, and I felt like I needed to have another conversation. I was worried about how to bring it up without sounding like I was blaming her. Eventually, I just asked if we could find a better solution together that worked for both of us.

We ended up having a really good discussion where we both expressed our needs and found common ground. She agreed to use headphones and keep the music volume low, and I promised to keep my late-night studying quieter as well. We even decided to set a specific time when she could start her morning routine without disturbing me.

In the end, I think we both learned to communicate better and respect each other's schedules. It felt like a win-win situation.

I waited a little while, hoping they would naturally quiet down, but when it didn’t happen, I decided to approach them. I went over and politely asked if they could lower the music a bit. They were friendly and understanding, and they immediately turned it down.

No one is the Asshole,"Throwaway account because my friend might see this.

(TLDR at the bottom)

I have a close friend, Alex, who recently decided to start a small business selling handmade candles. Alex is very passionate about it and has been putting in a lot of time and effort to make the candles look beautiful and smell great. I really admire their hustle and creativity.

Not long ago, Alex asked me to help them set up an Instagram account to promote the business. I was happy to help and thought it was a great idea. However, I also noticed that they were pricing the candles quite a bit higher than similar products in the market. When I asked about the pricing, Alex explained that they wanted to reflect the quality and the artisanal aspect of their work.

I didn’t want to discourage Alex, but I also didn't want them to set themselves up for failure. I gently suggested that they might want to look into the prices of competitor products and see if a slight adjustment could help attract more customers. I emphasized that I believed in their product but wanted to see them succeed.

Alex seemed hurt by my suggestion and felt that I was undermining their hard work and creativity.

I realized that I might have come across as dismissive of their vision, even though that wasn’t my intention.

After our conversation, I felt regretful about how I approached it and worried that I might have hurt their feelings. I also wondered if I should have just kept my thoughts to myself to avoid any conflict.

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been together for a few years now, and we both value personal space and independence. Recently, we decided to take a weekend trip together, and I was really looking forward to it. I had been working a lot and needed some time to reconnect and relax with each other.

A few weeks before the trip, I mentioned to my partner that I wanted to plan some activities that would be fun for both of us, like hiking and exploring local markets. My partner seemed excited, but I noticed they also started to mention wanting to spend some time alone during the trip to recharge. I completely understood this, as we both sometimes need our own space.

As the trip approached, I made a rough itinerary that included some shared activities but also left open time for us to do our own things if we wanted. I thought this would be a balanced approach since we both value our independence. I made sure to communicate my ideas with my partner, asking for their input. They liked the plan but still expressed a desire for more alone time during the trip.

When we arrived at our destination, we unpacked and I suggested going on a hike together. My partner hesitated, saying they were feeling a bit tired and wanted to stay back and relax. I felt a bit disappointed, as I was really excited to spend that time together, but I respected their wish and said it was fine if they wanted to stay back.

I ended up going on the hike alone, enjoying the fresh air and nature. Later that evening, I returned to our place and found my partner had fallen asleep on the couch. I felt a little hurt, thinking they could have at least stayed awake to enjoy some time together. But I understood everyone has different energy levels and needs, especially after a long week.

We talked about it later, and I told them I was glad they took the time they needed, but I also missed being together. They apologized for not being more engaged and explained they had underestimated how tired they would be. We both agreed that it’s important to communicate our needs even more clearly, especially while traveling together. We ended up finding a good balance for the rest of the trip, mixing shared activities with personal time.

In the end, I don't think either of us were at fault, but I’ve been wondering if I should have pushed more for us to spend that time together instead of just accepting their wish for solitude. I genuinely believe we both acted in good faith, but I still feel a bit unsure if I should have advocated more for our time as a couple.",437,1174,0.87,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_87099,2023-09-07 00:00:00,NAH,2540,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I’ve been grappling with a situation that happened recently with my friends, and I’m starting to wonder if I handled things the wrong way.

Backstory: I’m part of a close-knit friend group of five. We’ve known each other for years and have always been there for one another. A few months ago, one of our friends, Mia, started dating someone new. We were all excited for her, but as time went on, we started noticing some red flags about her boyfriend. He seemed controlling, and Mia often canceled plans at the last minute, claiming he didn’t want her to go out. 

A couple of weeks ago, we had plans for a game night, and Mia canceled again. This time, though, I felt like I had to say something. I reached out to her privately and expressed my concerns about her relationship. I didn't want to come off as judgmental, but I felt it was important to check in since she seemed so distant lately. Mia was upset with me for bringing it up, saying she was happy and that I was overreacting. 

After our conversation, she talked to the rest of the group and they were split. Some supported me for being concerned, while others thought I overstepped. I didn’t mean to cause tension; I just wanted to be a good friend looking out for her. 

Now, I’m wondering if I should have just kept quiet and let her figure it out on her own, or if it was right to voice my concerns. AITA for trying to look out for my friend?",564,2903,0.53,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_95819,2020-10-26 00:00:00,NAH,1408,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I (30M) live with my girlfriend (28F) and our two dogs. Recently, we've been planning to host a small get-together for friends this weekend. My girlfriend has been super stressed about it, wanting everything to be perfect, and I completely understand where she's coming from. She's been working long hours and juggling a lot of responsibilities.

A couple of nights ago, I came home from work and could see she was overwhelmed. I asked if she needed help with anything, and she just snapped at me, saying that I never take things seriously and that if I really cared, I would just ""know what to do."" I was taken aback because I was genuinely trying to be supportive. 

So, I decided to give her some space and not push. The next day, I figured I would surprise her by cleaning the house and doing some prep work for the party. I spent a few hours tidying up, organizing, and even making a snack table for our guests. I thought this would help relieve some of her stress.

When she came home, she was surprised but also seemed upset. She said that I had overstepped and should have consulted her about how she wanted things done because now I had rearranged things she had planned. I told her that my intention was to help and that I didn't mean to override her decisions. 

We ended up having a bit of a disagreement about it. I feel like I was trying to be proactive and supportive, while she felt like I wasn’t respecting her wishes. After talking it out, we both realized we had misunderstood each other and that communication could have been better on both sides.

In the end, we sat down together and made a plan for the party, combining her ideas with what I had already set up. It turned out to be a productive evening, and we felt much better about everything.

So, AITA for trying to help my girlfriend with the party planning even though it backfired a bit?

No one is the Asshole,"I've been working as a high school teacher for about 7 years now, and I love my job. Recently, I've been assigned a new student, ""Alex,"" who has been struggling academically and socially. He is a bright kid but has been facing some personal challenges at home that have affected his behavior and performance in school. His attendance has been inconsistent, and when he is present, he often seems disengaged or distracted.

I decided to reach out and check in on him, as I genuinely care about my students' well-being. After a few conversations, it became clear that he was dealing with a lot of stress at home. I offered to help him with his schoolwork and even suggested he come in for extra help during lunch. He seemed grateful and agreed to meet.

Over the next few weeks, we had several productive sessions where I helped him catch up on his assignments. However, I noticed that he was still having trouble connecting with his classmates. I thought it might help to recommend a small group project in class, hoping that it would help him make some friends and feel more included.

I approached Alex and asked if he would be comfortable working with a couple of other students who were also struggling. He hesitated and expressed that he felt anxious about working with others, worried about being judged. I understood where he was coming from and emphasized that it was a safe space and that everyone was there to learn together.

However, when I introduced the idea to the class, a couple of students voiced their concerns about working with Alex, mentioning his past behavior. I felt it was important to advocate for him and explained that everyone deserves a chance to collaborate and grow, regardless of their past. I did my best to create an inclusive atmosphere but recognized that some students still felt uncomfortable.

After class, Alex thanked me for trying to support him, but I could see he was still feeling anxious about the group work. I reassured him that I would be there to help facilitate and support him through the process. Yet, I couldn't shake the feeling that I might have overstepped by pushing him into a situation he wasn't ready for.

Now, I'm left wondering if I should have approached the situation differently, or if my intentions were misguided.

We've been saving up for this trip for quite some time, and we were excited to explore a new country together. However, my partner recently found out that her best friend is getting married during the same week we had planned our vacation. 

After discussing it, I encouraged her to attend the wedding since it's an important event for her. I told her I would completely understand if she wanted to postpone our trip or even go to the wedding alone. She felt guilty about possibly missing out on our anniversary trip, but I reassured her that we could always reschedule our vacation.

We spent a few days going back and forth about it. I tried to emphasize how much her friend meant to her and that it would be a great opportunity to support her. Eventually, she decided she wanted to go to the wedding and we agreed to postpone our trip, though we were both a bit disappointed.

After making the decision, I realized that I was feeling a bit hurt and left out, not because she chose her friend over me, but because I really had been looking forward to our time together. I expressed my feelings to her, and she understood where I was coming from. We talked openly about it, and it led to a deeper understanding of how we both felt.

In the end, we decided to plan a smaller getaway for just the two of us once she returns from the wedding. It turned out to be a good compromise, and we both felt respected in our choices.

No one is the Asshole,"I want to share something that happened recently involving my best friend, and I hope I can get some perspective on it.

So, I have this friend, Jamie, who has been working hard to get in shape and eat healthier. They’ve been on this journey for about a year now, and I’ve been really proud of their progress. However, it’s been a bit of a struggle for them, as they often feel pressured by societal standards and their own expectations.

A few weeks ago, Jamie invited me over for a dinner party to celebrate their progress. I was really excited and wanted to support them, so I made sure to bring a healthy dessert that I had been working on. I thought it would be a nice touch and something we could both enjoy without straying from their diet.

When I arrived, the atmosphere was great; they had prepared a delicious meal, and everything seemed to be going well. However, during the dinner, Jamie mentioned feeling overwhelmed by the pressure they put on themselves to eat perfectly and stay on track. They joked about how they couldn't even look at a slice of cake without feeling guilty.

I tried to uplift them by saying that it’s okay to indulge sometimes, and that food shouldn’t be a source of stress. I also mentioned that I brought the healthy dessert as a way to celebrate their achievements, not to add more pressure. However, Jamie seemed to deflate a little and said they just wanted to enjoy the night without thinking about food or diets.

I felt terrible; that wasn’t my intention at all. I apologized and tried to shift the conversation to something lighter. The rest of the night went smoothly, but I could tell that my comment had affected Jamie.

After the party, they texted me saying that while they appreciated my support, they felt like I didn’t understand the struggle they were going through and how much pressure they felt about their food choices. I explained that I only wanted to help and that I truly support their journey without judgment, but I also understood their feelings.

In hindsight, I realize that I might have inadvertently added to their stress instead of alleviating it. I genuinely wanted to celebrate their accomplishments, but I can see how my focus on healthy eating might have come off as insensitive.

So, I’m left wondering if I overstepped by bringing a healthy dessert when what my friend really needed was to feel free from dietary concerns for just one night.

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I recently hosted a small dinner party with a few close friends. We're both pretty laid-back about food, and we love trying out new recipes, so we decided to have a themed night with international dishes. I made a spicy Thai curry, and my partner prepared a classic Italian pasta dish. 

One of our friends, Alex, has a very different perspective on food. He considers himself a food purist and has very specific tastes. He doesn’t like anything spicy or with too many flavors mixed together. When he arrived, he didn’t hold back on expressing his disdain for the dishes we prepared. He grimaced at the curry and loudly proclaimed that pasta should never have anything but tomato sauce on it.

Throughout the night, he kept making comments like, “Why would anyone ruin good pasta with that?” and “This curry is way too spicy for anyone to enjoy.” It made the atmosphere a bit awkward, and I could see that some of our other guests were uncomfortable, too. 

I tried to lighten the mood by asking him what he would prefer, and suggesting we could make something simpler for our next gathering. But he just shrugged and said he didn't want to be a bother. I then jokingly suggested that maybe we could just serve him plain noodles next time. 

Later in the evening, I caught him sneaking some of the leftover curry to save for later, so it seemed like he enjoyed it more than he let on. When the night ended, I thought about how I could approach this situation better next time while still making space for our diverse tastes at gatherings. I want to maintain our friendship without compromising on the fun of sharing new foods.

A few weeks ago, I was organizing a small gathering at my house to celebrate a friend’s birthday. I invited a close group of friends, and while planning, I noticed that one of my friends, Sarah, had been going through a tough time lately due to her job situation. I wanted to make her feel included and appreciated, so I decided to surprise her with a little birthday cake along with the main cake for our friend.

When the day arrived, I set up everything and made sure to have a small cake specifically for Sarah, thinking it would lift her spirits. However, when I presented the cakes, Sarah looked a bit taken aback. She smiled and thanked me, but I could see that she felt uncomfortable being the center of attention, especially since it wasn’t her birthday.

Later that evening, Sarah pulled me aside and told me she appreciated the gesture but felt awkward having a cake for her when it wasn’t her special day. She mentioned that she felt it overshadowed our friend’s birthday, which wasn’t my intention at all. I apologized for not considering her feelings and assured her that I just wanted to make her feel good.

I genuinely meant well, but I can see how it might have come off wrong. So, am I the asshole for trying to cheer up a friend with a surprise that ended up being awkward for her?

However, halfway through our trip, we found ourselves in a remote area where there were no grocery stores, and our food supply was running low. 

We came across a small diner that looked charming, and I suggested we stop there for a meal. My friend hesitated because of their healthy eating goals and suggested we should just stick to our pre-packed meals. I understood where they were coming from, but I also felt like we should enjoy the experience of trying local food. After discussing it, we decided to compromise: we would have lunch at the diner but would still stick to lighter menu options.

The meal turned out to be delicious and surprisingly healthy—much better than I had expected! We ended up having a great time, sharing stories with the diner staff, and making fun memories. My friend even thanked me for suggesting the stop, saying it felt good to enjoy a meal out without completely abandoning their eating goals.

Looking back, I felt like we navigated the situation well. We respected each other's preferences and found a way to enjoy our trip while still sticking to our values.

The director of the center, Lisa, has been like a mentor to me, and I truly care about the center and the people we serve.

Recently, Lisa had to take a medical leave because of some health issues. She’s been open about her condition, and we’ve all been supportive.

One day, a couple of weeks into her leave, I received a message from one of the part-time instructors, Sarah, who had been feeling overwhelmed with her own classes. She asked if I could help her out by taking over one of her classes temporarily. I wanted to help, but I was already stretched thin with my own duties and could feel my stress levels rising. I told her I couldn’t take on any more, and she seemed really disappointed.

A few days later, I bumped into Sarah, and she expressed her frustration about the situation. I realized she was right—everyone is trying their best, and we’re all feeling the strain without Lisa there to guide us. I felt bad because I wanted to support my colleagues and the community, but I also needed to prioritize my own mental health.

As we were hiking, Sarah started to lag behind a bit. I noticed she was quieter than usual and seemed to be struggling with the steep parts of the trail. I asked her if she was okay, and she assured me she was just a bit tired. She mentioned that she hadn’t had much sleep the night before due to work.

I don’t enjoy roughing it, and I have some anxiety about being in a situation where I might not feel comfortable or safe.

When I expressed my concerns to my partner, he was a bit disappointed. He’s really excited about the reunion and sees it as a great opportunity for us to bond with his family. I understand where he’s coming from, but I also don’t want to put myself in a situation that I know will make me miserable. He suggested that I at least try to go for part of the weekend, but I’m really hesitant.

I’m trying to figure out what to do. I want to support him and his family, but the thought of spending a weekend in a cabin without basic comforts is not appealing to me at all. So, AITA if I decide not to go to the reunion because I can’t handle the camping aspect? 

EDIT: I’ve offered to host a get-together at my place after the reunion for family who might not be into camping either, so we can still connect in a more comfortable setting.",493,615,0.93,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_57146,2024-12-12 00:00:00,NAH,1563,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I really need some perspective here, because I'm feeling caught in a tricky situation with my family.

Last month, my younger sister, who is 21, got engaged to her boyfriend of about two years. They seem really happy, and I fully support their decision. However, my sister has always had a tradition of asking me to be her maid of honor whenever she thought about getting married, and now that she’s engaged, she’s naturally looking to me for that role.

Here's where things get complicated: my sister's boyfriend has a 17-year-old sister, and she seems to idolize my sister. During a recent family dinner, my sister mentioned how she wants her fiancé’s sister to be her “junior bridesmaid.” I think it’s a sweet idea, but I expressed my concern about how it might be perceived, considering that the age gap can be a bit awkward in such roles.

My sister got upset with me, saying that I was ruining her excitement. She insisted that it’s her wedding and she can have whoever she wants in her bridal party, which I completely agree with. However, I genuinely think that having a junior bridesmaid at her wedding might not be the best choice, given the dynamics and the age difference.

I didn’t mean to undermine her or her choices, and I apologized for bringing it up. But she is still hurt, and our conversations have been tense since then. I'm feeling torn because I want to support her, but I also think it's worth considering how it might play out.

So, AITA for voicing my concern about my sister wanting to include her fiancé’s younger sister in her bridal party? 

EDIT: We're very close, and I genuinely just wanted to have an open conversation. I realize now that she was just excited and expected my support without any hesitation. I appreciate the feedback!",237,996,0.89,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_41410,2020-06-19 00:00:00,NAH,1769,AITA

He’s really passionate about the outdoors and has been looking forward to this adventure because it’s a chance for him to experience nature and bond with some close friends.

I’m an avid hiker and know how important it is to be prepared for difficult terrain. I’ve seen people get injured or overwhelmed on those trails. I’m worried because Sam isn’t as experienced, and while he’s excited, I feel he might be underestimating the risks involved. 

I’m considering reaching out to him to express my concerns and suggest that he either trains a bit more before tackling that specific trail or perhaps chooses a different, easier route instead. I just want him to have a fun and safe experience.

No one is the Asshole,"So this happened a few days ago, and I’m still sorting through my feelings about it.

I (24F) have been friends with a guy, Jake (25M), for about five years. We met through mutual friends at university, and over the years, we’ve become really close. We share a lot of interests, including hiking, gaming, and movies. We’ve always supported each other, and I consider him one of my best friends.

Recently, Jake started dating someone new, Amanda (23F). They seem really happy together, and I’m genuinely happy for him. However, I noticed that since they started dating, Jake has been pulling away from our friendship. He doesn’t initiate plans anymore, and our conversations have become less frequent.

Feeling a bit neglected, I reached out to Jake and asked if we could hang out. He told me that he’s been really busy with Amanda and that he wants to focus on his new relationship. I completely understood that relationships take time, but I also felt a bit hurt that he was so quick to put our friendship on the back burner. 

I decided to invite both Jake and Amanda to a group hike I was organizing with a few other friends. I thought it would be a great way to reconnect with Jake and meet Amanda. When I sent the invite, Jake replied that he and Amanda were busy that weekend. It stung a little, but I tried not to take it personally.

The day of the hike, I ended up going with just a couple of friends. We had a blast, and I ended up posting a few pictures on social media. A few hours later, Jake messaged me, clearly upset. He said he felt excluded and that I should have invited him to join, even though I did invite him. I explained that I reached out, but he couldn’t make it, and I didn’t want to wait around for him.

We ended up having a long conversation about balancing relationships and friendships, and I told him I felt hurt that our friendship seemed to be slipping. He apologized and said he didn’t mean to make me feel that way. We both acknowledged that it’s hard to balance everything and that it’s not about one being more important than the other.

By the end of the conversation, I felt like we were both on the same page, but I can’t shake the feeling of being a bit hurt and left out. I don’t think he’s the asshole for wanting to focus on his relationship, but I didn’t want to feel like I was losing a close friend either. 

So, am I the asshole for feeling hurt and calling him out, or is he the asshole for not making more effort with our friendship? I genuinely want to know what you all think!",257,2642,0.5,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_89851,2018-03-06 00:00:00,NAH,2531,AITA

Here’s the background: I (24F) have a close friend, Jamie (23F), who has been struggling with her mental health for quite some time. She’s been open about her anxiety and depression, and I’ve tried to be supportive by checking in on her regularly and inviting her to hang out whenever I can. However, I noticed that she has been withdrawing more and more lately, often canceling plans at the last minute or not responding to texts for days.

Recently, I planned a small get-together at my apartment for a few of our friends. I invited Jamie, but she texted me the day of saying she wasn’t feeling up to it and needed some time alone. I completely understood and told her that it was okay, but I felt a twinge of disappointment since I wanted her to be there. The problem is that during the get-together, I posted a few photos on social media, including one where the group was laughing and having a good time.

The next day, Jamie reached out to me and shared that she felt hurt seeing those photos because it reminded her that she wasn’t there. She expressed that she felt left out and disconnected from our friend group. I felt terrible and apologized, explaining that I didn’t mean to upset her and that I genuinely wanted her there. I also told her that I would have understood if she had just texted me to let me know how she was feeling about it.

After our talk, I decided to take down the photos and reassured her that I value our friendship. However, I still felt like I was in a tough spot because I wanted to share moments with our friends but also didn’t want to hurt her feelings.

Now I’m left wondering if I was inconsiderate for posting those pictures or if she should have communicated her feelings better.

When she arrived, I noticed she seemed a bit down, so I asked her how she was doing. We talked for a while, and I wanted to lighten the mood, so I jokingly said, ""Well, if you need food, you can always come over and raid my pantry!"" She laughed, but I could tell there was some truth in my joke.

After dinner, I offered her some leftovers to take home, and she gratefully accepted. I packed up a good amount of food for her, wanting to make sure she had something to eat for the next few days. As she was leaving, I also remembered that I had some clothes I no longer wear. They were in great condition, and I thought they might fit her, so I offered her a few tops and a jacket.

At first, she hesitated, saying she didn't want to take my clothes. I insisted, telling her that I just wanted to help and that I knew she could really use them. Eventually, she agreed, and I felt good about being able to support her in some small way.

A few days later, I got a message from her. She thanked me for the food and clothes but mentioned that she felt a bit embarrassed accepting secondhand items. She said she appreciated the gesture, but it made her feel like she was in a worse position than she already thought she was.

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been together for a few years now, and we’ve been talking about starting a family. Recently, we’ve been spending more time with my partner's sister and her husband, who have two young kids. They are great parents, but they have a very different parenting style than we do, which has led to some awkward moments.

A few weekends ago, we went to their house for a family barbecue. It was a lovely day, and everything was going well until my sister-in-law started talking about her approach to parenting. She’s very much a proponent of strict discipline and routine, while I believe in a more flexible and gentle approach. As we were all sitting around, she mentioned how she wouldn’t allow her kids to have dessert unless they finished all their vegetables, and that they should be “taught a lesson” when they misbehave.

I could sense the tension in the air, as my partner and I have different views on discipline as well. I tried to keep the conversation light and even spoke about how we believe in positive reinforcement. My sister-in-law, however, seemed to take my comments as a direct challenge to her methods and started to get defensive. The atmosphere shifted, and I felt uncomfortable.

Later on, when the kids came in to ask for dessert, she reiterated her stance in front of everyone and added that “some families don’t know how to raise their kids properly.” I felt that this was directed at me, so I calmly responded that every family has their own way of doing things, and that our approaches might differ, but that doesn’t mean one is better than the other. 

Afterwards, my partner said that I might have come off as condescending and that I should have let it go. I thought I was just standing up for our parenting choices, but now I’m wondering if I overstepped and made things awkward. My sister-in-law hasn’t reached out since, and I feel bad.

No one is the Asshole,"Over the past summer, I returned home after my second year of college, and my parents were really excited to have me back. They asked me to help out with their small family restaurant, which I had done in the past without any pay. This time, however, things were a bit different for me financially. I had taken out some loans for my education and was struggling to cover my personal expenses. 

I approached my parents and explained that while I loved helping out, I really needed some money during the summer to support myself. I didn’t think it was unreasonable to ask for a small wage, especially since I was committing quite a bit of time and effort to assist them. They were taken aback and felt hurt that I would want to be paid, arguing that they had always supported me and that helping out at the restaurant was part of being a family. They suggested that I should just be grateful for the opportunity to learn and contribute.

Feeling bad about the situation, I agreed to help out without pay, but it left me feeling a bit resentful and financially strained. I tried to make the best of it, but it was a constant reminder that I was working hard without any compensation. Eventually, I ended up working there for three months and tried to keep a positive attitude, but I still felt a bit taken for granted.

No one is the Asshole,"I'm going to try to keep this brief. My sister and I have a great relationship, but we've had some tension lately due to her becoming a new mother. She gave birth a few months ago, and while I'm thrilled for her, I feel like she's become a little overprotective and distant. I understand that new parents can be overwhelmed and anxious, but it feels like she's pushed away a lot of her friends and family, including me.

A couple of weeks ago, I offered to come over and help her with anything she needed, whether it was cooking meals, cleaning, or just giving her a break. She seemed hesitant and said she wanted to do things her own way for now. I respected that but felt sad that my offer wasn’t welcomed.

Then, last weekend, I attended a family gathering where my sister was also present. I brought a gift for her and the baby, a cute little toy and a handmade blanket. When I handed it to her, she smiled but then immediately said, ""You know, I really don’t want people to give my baby gifts right now. I want to keep things simple.""

I was taken aback but didn’t want to make a scene, so I just nodded and said, “Of course, I understand.” However, I felt hurt and a bit rejected. After thinking about it, I realized that she might just be going through a lot of changes and may not even realize how her words affect those around her.

Later, I decided to reach out to her privately. I let her know that I respect her choices as a new mother, but I also miss our connection and would love to support her in whatever way she feels comfortable.

We’ve always supported each other’s ambitions and accomplishments, and I made sure to celebrate her nomination enthusiastically.

A few weeks ago, I received a promotion at work that I had been aiming for a long time. I was excited and wanted to share the news with my family. I told my sister first because I thought she'd appreciate hearing it directly from me, especially since it was a significant milestone for me. 

When I shared the news, her reaction was somewhat muted. Instead of congratulating me, she quickly shifted the conversation back to her award nomination. It felt a bit dismissive, but I brushed it off, thinking she might just be in a focused mindset about her award.

During a family gathering, I jokingly mentioned that it felt like I was living in her shadow with all the attention she was receiving. I didn’t mean to offend her; I just wanted to express how I felt. However, she seemed hurt and said that I was being self-centered.

While my daughter was climbing on the jungle gym, I noticed a boy, probably around 10 years old, running around with a group of kids. He seemed to be playing tag, but I noticed he was a bit rougher than the others, pushing and shoving a bit too much. My daughter was just starting to make her way down the slide when I heard a loud thud followed by a burst of crying. I turned to see that the boy had accidentally collided with her while running and had knocked her down.

I rushed over to my daughter, who was on the ground, visibly upset and holding her arm. I could see that she was scared and in pain, but thankfully she didn’t seem to be seriously hurt. I comforted her and checked to see if she could move her arm. Meanwhile, I noticed the boy was standing a few feet away, looking a bit remorseful but not coming over to apologize.

After I made sure my daughter was okay, I walked over to the boy, who was still with his friends. I gently told him that it was important to be careful while playing and that he needed to apologize to my daughter for running into her. I didn’t raise my voice or blame him, but I wanted him to understand the importance of being mindful of others. The boy looked a bit sheepish and mumbled an apology.

I wanted to make sure that my daughter understood the importance of standing up for herself, but I also didn’t want to come off as overly harsh on the boy. I keep wondering if I handled everything appropriately and if I was too tough on a kid who genuinely didn’t mean any harm.

My friends and I had planned a small picnic at a local park for weeks. We all brought different dishes, and it was supposed to be a nice afternoon to catch up and enjoy some good food.

Everything was going well until a larger group of people set up nearby. They were celebrating a birthday, and at first, it seemed harmless. They had music playing loudly, and while it was a bit disruptive, we tried to ignore it and focus on our conversations and food.

However, as the afternoon went on, the volume of their music increased, and they began to play games that involved shouting and laughter. It got louder and louder, making it difficult for us to hear each other. I could see that my friends were getting increasingly frustrated, and I felt bad because we’d all been looking forward to this day.

After some time, I decided to approach the group. I thought maybe they didn’t realize how loud they were being, and I wanted to ask if they could lower the volume a bit. I approached them politely and explained that we were trying to enjoy our picnic and asked if they could keep the noise down.

To my surprise, they were really nice about it. They acknowledged the volume and agreed to turn the music down. They even offered us some cake as a gesture of goodwill! I thanked them and walked back to my group feeling relieved.

However, later on, I overheard some of my friends discussing whether it was appropriate for me to intervene. They worried that I might have come off as rude or dampened their celebration. I didn’t mean to ruin anyone’s fun; I just wanted to be able to enjoy our day too.

Now I'm left wondering if I overstepped by asking them to lower the volume. Was it wrong for me to speak up in that situation? Was it fair to expect them to consider our picnic while they were celebrating? AITA for asking them to keep it down?",487,2914,0.86,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_19388,2018-11-20 00:00:00,NAH,1965,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, I've been practicing meditation for a couple of years now and have found it really helpful for my mental well-being. I usually join a local group every Thursday where we do a guided session together. My friends have noticed the positive changes in me and have expressed interest in trying it out as well. 

Recently, we decided to have a gathering at my house and I thought it would be a great opportunity to introduce them to meditation. I offered to lead a short session, thinking they might enjoy it and it could be a fun way to share something I love. I made it clear that it was optional and we could do it at the end of the evening after some games and snacks.

However, during the evening, when I started to lead the meditation, it became clear that not everyone was on board. A couple of my friends were giggling, and one even made a comment about it being ""weird."" I felt a bit disappointed, but I tried to stay calm and just asked if they wanted to try it anyway. Most of them agreed, but the energy was definitely off.

After the session, I sensed that some of my friends were still feeling a bit uncomfortable. I apologized if I pushed them into something they didn't want to do and reassured them that it was totally okay if they didn’t enjoy it. I just wanted to share something that had helped me.

Now I'm wondering if it was wrong to try and introduce meditation to my friends, especially since it didn’t go as planned. So, AITA for wanting to share my meditation practice with my friends, even though it didn’t turn out well?",40,1347,0.8,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_21358,2024-11-09 00:00:00,NAH,1547,AITA

After a few brainstorming sessions, I decided to go with a vintage carnival theme. I was thrilled about it and started working on the details, from the decor to the games. I shared my ideas with my friend, and she loved them but said she wanted to do something a little more classic for her wedding.

Fast forward a few weeks, and I get a text from her saying she's had a change of heart and wants to do a carnival theme too. I was taken aback because I felt like I had put a lot of effort into my concept and it seemed unfair that she would just take it. I expressed my feelings to her, but she insisted that she loved the idea and didn’t think it would be a big deal since our weddings were at different venues and on different dates.

I felt conflicted because I didn’t want to ruin our friendship over a wedding theme, but I couldn't shake the feeling that she was being inconsiderate. So, I told her I was a bit hurt by her decision and needed some time to process it.

Now, I'm left wondering if I was being unreasonable for feeling possessive over my wedding theme. Am I the asshole for being upset about this?",712,1743,0.94,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_11201,2022-02-04 00:00:00,NAH,1387,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I have a friend, Sarah, who has been dealing with a really tough situation at work. She’s been working for a small company for several years and has been passed over for promotions multiple times, while a new hire, Jake, who has less experience, has been getting all the opportunities. Sarah is understandably frustrated about it and often vents to me about how she feels undervalued and overlooked.

A few weeks ago, Sarah asked me for advice on how to approach her boss to discuss her career path and potential growth within the company. I encouraged her to prepare for the conversation and even offered to help her role-play what she might say. I thought it would empower her to advocate for herself.

However, during our practice sessions, I noticed her getting increasingly upset about Jake's presence in the workplace and the perceived favoritism. I suggested that she focus on her own strengths and make her case without comparing herself to him, as that could come off as unprofessional. I meant well, but I may have come off as dismissive of her feelings.

The day of her meeting with her boss rolled around, and I didn’t hear from her afterward, so I reached out to check in. She told me that she brought up her concerns, but she ended up mentioning Jake and how it felt unfair that he was advancing so quickly. It didn’t go well, and she felt embarrassed for bringing him into the conversation.

Now, she’s upset with me, saying that I should have supported her feelings about Jake more. I feel bad because I genuinely wanted to help her, but I also think it’s important to maintain professionalism in these situations. I wonder if maybe I could have validated her feelings better without steering her away from mentioning Jake at all.

So, AITA for trying to help my friend prepare for a difficult conversation even if it led to her feeling worse afterward? 

TLDR: I tried to help my friend prepare for a work meeting, but I suggested she not mention a co-worker who she felt was favored, which upset her.",108,2362,0.9,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_46401,2023-02-01 00:00:00,NAH,2018,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I’ve been stuck in a bit of a family dilemma lately, and I wanted to get some outside perspective on it.

A little background: I’m 32 and my younger sister, Emma, is 29. Growing up, we were really close, but as we’ve gotten older, we’ve both developed our own lives and interests. Emma recently got married and is expecting her first child, which is exciting for our family. Our parents are thrilled, and our extended family is just as excited about the new addition.

Here’s where the issue comes in. Emma and her husband have decided they want to raise their child with a focus on a specific set of family traditions that they grew up with, which includes a lot of involvement from both sets of grandparents. They want to do things their way, and that's perfectly fine. However, Emma has also decided that she wants to be called ""Mommy"" in a very traditional sense, and she has asked me to stop using that term when referring to myself in the context of her child.

I’ve always loved being the fun aunt, and I often step in to help out with family events and babysitting, which I enjoy. I’ve casually referred to myself as “Auntie” and have even jokingly called myself “Mommy 2.0” in front of Emma, thinking it was all in good fun. But Emma made it clear that it makes her uncomfortable and she wants to set boundaries. I fully understand her desire to establish her parenting identity, and I respect that. 

I told her that I would stop, but it made me feel a little sad since I’ve always envisioned sharing a special bond with my niece or nephew. I’m worried that this might create a distance between us as sisters, but I also don’t want to step on her toes as a new mom. 

So, am I the asshole for wanting to maintain a special relationship with my future niece or nephew in a way that my sister finds inappropriate? Or is Emma justified in wanting to set that boundary?",261,1141,0.7,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_25454,2018-06-21 00:00:00,NAH,1875,AITA

I’m a bit of an introvert, so while I appreciate their camaraderie, I usually prefer to keep to myself during lunch and breaks. I often use that time to read or catch up on some personal projects.

Recently, some of my coworkers have started to express concern that I'm not engaging with the team enough. They’ve invited me to join them for lunch several times, and while I appreciate the gesture, I’ve politely declined each time because I just feel more comfortable doing my own thing. 

One day, I overheard a couple of my coworkers discussing how they felt I was isolating myself and how they wanted to include me more. I understand that they have good intentions, but I also feel like I should be allowed to choose how I spend my breaks without it being a big deal.

I immediately felt bad and tried to backtrack, saying I was just joking and that her drawing was really beautiful, but she was already upset and ran off to her room. I went to talk to her later and apologized, explaining that I didn't mean to hurt her feelings and that I really loved her art.

As I approached the counter to place my order, I noticed an older gentleman (around 70) sitting alone at a table near the window, visibly upset. He was hunched over, and I could see he was having some difficulty with his phone. After I placed my order, I decided to check on him.

Me: ""Excuse me, sir, you seem a bit troubled. Is everything alright?""

He looked up, surprised, and told me he was trying to reach his daughter. He explained that he had recently moved to the area and didn’t have many contacts yet. I offered to help him, and he handed me his phone. It turned out he was struggling with the app he was using to make the call. After a few minutes of frustration, I managed to get the call through for him.

While we were talking, he opened up about feeling lonely since relocating. I tried to comfort him, suggesting that he join a local community group or even consider taking a class to meet new people. He seemed grateful for the conversation, but I could still see a hint of sadness in his eyes.

After we finished his call, I went to grab my coffee and pastry. As I was about to leave, I glanced back at him and noticed he was still sitting there alone. I felt a bit guilty knowing that I was about to head off to work while he was still feeling down. So, I decided to ask if he wanted to join me for a bit.

Me: ""Would you like to join me at my table? I’d love to chat more if you’re up for it.""

He smiled and accepted the invitation. We ended up talking for about 30 minutes, sharing stories about our lives and interests. He mentioned his love for gardening, and I shared my hobby of painting. It was a nice moment, and I could see he was feeling much better.

Eventually, I had to leave for my work, and I thanked him for the lovely conversation. He expressed his gratitude and mentioned how much he appreciated the kindness of a stranger.

Reflecting on the situation, I felt that while I interrupted his day, it was in a positive way that led to a meaningful connection.

One of my friends, Alex, was in charge of bringing the grill and some of the main food items. A few days before the trip, I reached out to Alex to confirm what he was bringing and if he needed any help. He assured me everything was under control and he had it all figured out.

When we arrived at the campsite, it turned out that Alex had forgotten the grill and only brought a couple of bags of chips.

After talking it over, we decided to split the cost of a portable grill from a nearby store, and everyone chipped in to buy some food.

Alex felt really bad about what happened and apologized multiple times. The whole situation was awkward but we ended up having a good time hanging out around the fire.

We’ve always had a good roommate dynamic—sharing chores, cooking meals together, and being respectful of each other’s space. Recently, however, Emily adopted a puppy, which we both agreed on, but I think I underestimated how much work and energy a young dog requires.

At first, I was excited about the puppy, but soon I started noticing that Emily was hardly around during the day because she was taking the puppy out for walks and training sessions. While I understand that puppies need a lot of attention, the situation started to feel a bit one-sided. I found myself taking care of the puppy more often than I expected—feeding him, playing with him, and cleaning up after him—while Emily was busy with her work and social life.

I decided to bring it up to Emily during one of our evening talks. I expressed that I was feeling overwhelmed and that I thought we needed to discuss how to better share the responsibility of taking care of the puppy. I suggested we create a schedule where we would alternate days for walking and caring for him, so it felt more balanced.

I told him not to worry about it too much, that I appreciated their apology, and that I had enough food at home to share another time. We ended up having a good conversation, and he even offered to help me out with clean-up.

In the end, we all enjoyed the potluck together, and I thought it was a nice way to connect. I felt bad about the lasagna but was glad we could all move past it. My friends later said I was too easygoing and that I should've insisted on them compensating me for the ruined dish. I don’t think that would have been fair to do in that situation, though.

No one is the Asshole,"I (28F) have a close friend (27F) who I've known since college. We’ve always supported each other, but recently, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed. 

About six months ago, she got a new job that requires her to work long hours, and I’ve been helping her out by picking her up and dropping her off when her shifts end late at night. I don’t mind doing this occasionally, but it’s become a regular thing, and I feel like I’m driving her around more than I get to see her as a friend.

She doesn't have a car, and while she has mentioned that she’s considering getting one, it hasn’t happened yet. Lately, I’ve noticed that she’s been relying on me not only for rides after work but also for other errands, like picking up groceries or going to appointments. I’ve even changed my plans multiple times to accommodate her schedule, and while I want to be supportive, it’s starting to feel like I’m the only one making an effort.

I recently brought up how I was feeling, explaining that I love our friendship but I was getting a bit drained from always being the one driving. I suggested we could look into carpooling or she could consider getting rides from other friends sometimes. She got upset, saying she thought I enjoyed helping her and that she didn’t realize how much it was affecting me.

I feel guilty for bringing it up, but I also think it’s important to communicate how I feel. We talked it through, and she apologized for not being more considerate and promised to try to find other arrangements. So, AITA for expressing my feelings about our driving situation?",180,1743,0.94,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_42755,2023-09-15 00:00:00,NAH,1573,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I’m posting this from an alt account because the people involved might recognize my main. So here’s the deal: My [28M] friend [29M] is planning a big birthday party for himself. He’s been talking about it for months and is really excited. He’s also been very clear that it’s going to be an adult-only party, which is totally fine by me. 

Here’s where things got a bit tricky. My wife [27F] and I have a 2-year-old son. We’ve been trying to find a babysitter for that night, but it turns out that most of our usual options are busy. The party is less than a week away, and we still don’t have anyone to watch our son.

After discussing it with my wife, we decided that I would stay home with our son while she goes to the party. I didn’t think it was a big deal; I love spending time with my son, and I figured my friend would understand. I texted my friend to let him know that I wouldn’t be able to make it because we couldn’t find a sitter. 

He responded by saying he was disappointed and that he wished I would have made more of an effort to figure something out. I tried to explain our situation, but he seemed upset that we wouldn’t at least try to find another option. I also mentioned that I felt it was more important to take care of our son than to attend the party. 

Now I’m confused. I understand that it’s his big day, but my family comes first. I didn’t mean to upset him, but I also didn’t want to leave my son with someone we couldn’t trust or find at the last minute.

No one is the Asshole,"My friend Sarah has been going through a really tough time lately. She lost her job a few months back and has been struggling to find a new one while also dealing with some personal issues. I’ve been trying to support her as much as I can, and we’ve been spending more time together to help lift her spirits.

Recently, a mutual friend of ours, Jake, invited us both to a weekend camping trip with a larger group. I thought it would be a great way for Sarah to unwind and get away from everything for a bit. However, when I mentioned this to Sarah, she expressed that she felt anxious about the idea of socializing with so many people while she’s not feeling her best.

I totally understood where she was coming from and didn’t want to pressure her into going if she wasn’t comfortable. I suggested that she take a pass on the trip and focus on herself, but she felt guilty about missing out and letting everyone down. 

Eventually, I decided to talk to Jake and let him know how Sarah was feeling, thinking it might be best if we didn’t include her in the group plans this time. Jake was really understanding and said he’d reach out to Sarah to let her know it was totally fine if she didn’t want to come.

After Jake talked to her, Sarah felt relieved but also a bit bad about not being part of the group. She told me she appreciated that I had her back, but she also felt it was unfair for me to speak on her behalf without fully knowing how she felt about the situation.

I didn’t mean to overstep—I just wanted to protect her feelings. Now I’m wondering if I should have just let her make the decision herself without getting involved. 

WIBTA if I had a conversation with Jake about Sarah’s feelings, or was it the right thing to do to ensure she didn’t feel pressured?

No one is the Asshole,"I (28F) share an apartment with my younger brother (22M). We've always gotten along pretty well, but since he graduated college and started a new job, he often works late hours and hangs out with friends more than he used to. 

Recently, I’ve picked up a part-time job to help save for a trip I've been planning. My schedule is pretty packed, and I’ve been trying to balance work, my side gig, and my personal life. Last week, I decided to throw a small get-together with a few friends to unwind and celebrate my recent accomplishments.

Since my brother was working late that night, I thought it would be fine to have my friends over. I even texted him earlier in the day, letting him know what I was planning and that he was more than welcome to join us if he finished work in time. He replied that he wouldn’t be home until after midnight and said it was all good for me to have my friends over. 

The night went well, and my friends and I were having a great time. We kept the noise at a reasonable level, but I guess we got a bit louder as the night went on. My brother ended up coming home around 1 AM. He walked in and was clearly annoyed and a bit taken aback by the noise and the crowd in the living room.

I immediately apologized and asked if he wanted to join us, but he just said he was tired and went to his room. Later, he came back out and told me that he didn't appreciate me having friends over without considering that he might want a quiet night at home. I tried to explain that I thought it was okay since he told me it was fine, but he seemed upset and said I should have anticipated he would want some peace after a long day.

We've hit it off and have been hanging out pretty regularly. Last week, Mia invited me to a small gathering at her place with a few of her friends. I was excited because I thought it would be a great opportunity to meet new people.

When I arrived, I realized that Mia's ex-boyfriend, Jake (28m), was also there. They broke up about six months ago, and it was evident that there was still some tension between them. Throughout the evening, I tried to keep things light and fun, but I noticed that Jake seemed to be a bit uncomfortable with me being there.

At one point, I overheard Jake making a comment to Mia about how he wished she'd stop bringing new people around so soon after their breakup. I felt a little awkward, but I didn't want to create a scene, so I just focused on enjoying myself and chatting with other guests.

Later in the evening, Mia pulled me aside and expressed that she was glad I came but that she felt bad about Jake being there and that she didn’t want me to get caught in the middle of any drama. I appreciated her concern but assured her that I was having a good time and didn’t mind Jake being there.

After the gathering, I mentioned to Mia that I sensed some tension and that it felt a bit off, but I also said I understood that it was a situation that was complicated. I didn’t want to offend her by saying too much about Jake.

Mia thanked me for being understanding, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that maybe I should have just avoided the situation altogether since it seemed to affect her.

No one is the Asshole,"My younger sister, Emily, recently graduated from college, and we had a small family celebration for her. During the event, my older brother, Jake, brought up some old family stories and shared some embarrassing moments from our childhood. While we were all laughing, Emily seemed to get increasingly quiet and withdrawn. I noticed it but didn’t think much of it at the time, as I assumed she was just taking it all in.

Later in the evening, I overheard her talking to a friend on the phone. She mentioned that she felt like the family always focuses on our childhood memories and never really acknowledges her achievements or her journey through college. That hit me hard because I’ve always been proud of her and believed I celebrated her successes.

The next day, I reached out to Emily and apologized if it seemed like we overshadowed her accomplishments. I explained that we were just reminiscing and didn’t mean to take the spotlight off her. She appreciated my concern but still felt that sometimes the humor in our stories can come at the expense of not recognizing her hard work.

I suggested we hold a separate gathering focused entirely on her accomplishments where she could share her own stories, but she seemed hesitant, saying she didn’t want to force it. I feel like we both have valid points—she wants recognition, and I just want to celebrate our family’s shared history.

A few weeks ago, my sister called me up, excited to tell me she got a new job. She was really thrilled about it, and I was happy for her. However, during the conversation, she mentioned that her new boss is really strict about work-life balance and that he's a bit of a stickler for rules. I jokingly said, ""Wow, sounds like you’re getting a job with a real life adult, not like the rest of us slackers!"" 

She laughed at first, but then she seemed to get a little defensive and said, ""Hey, don’t say that. Just because I’m excited about my job doesn’t mean I think I’m better than anyone else."" I realized I might have unintentionally upset her, so I quickly apologized, explaining that I was just trying to make a light-hearted joke and not to put her down.

We ended up going to dinner a few days later, and I made sure to listen more than talk, but I still couldn’t shake the feeling that I might have hurt her feelings.

I was really excited about it, but I knew I had a prior commitment that day—an important family gathering. I texted Sarah to let her know that I wouldn’t be able to make it, and she seemed really disappointed. She asked if I could at least come for the first hour before heading to my family event, and I told her I’d do my best.

That day came, and I managed to leave my family gathering a little early, so I could show up at Sarah's party. When I arrived, I saw that it was already pretty lively, and everyone was having a great time. I went up to Sarah to wish her a happy birthday and give her the gift I had picked out. She seemed really happy to see me, but as I was trying to mingle, I noticed that some of her other friends (whom I don’t know very well) were being kind of standoffish. I later discovered that they had been discussing the party together and had a certain vibe in mind.

While I was there, I overheard them talking about how they were disappointed that I showed up because they thought the party would be more fun if it was just their close-knit group.

No one is the Asshole,"Alright everyone, I need some judgement on this one...

My partner and I have been living together for a little over a year and, like any couple, we have our quirks. One of mine is that I love to cook and try new recipes, while my partner prefers to stick to the tried-and-true meals they grew up with. We usually take turns cooking dinner, and I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen, which often leads to some interesting (and sometimes unusual) meals.

Recently, I decided to try my hand at making a traditional dish from a culture that I’ve always admired. I spent the whole day preparing it, excited to share this new experience with my partner. However, when I served it, my partner took one look at the dish and immediately frowned. They hesitated to try it, saying they were “not in the mood for something different” and that they “just wanted something simple” instead.

I felt a bit hurt because I had put a lot of effort into making something special and was hoping for their support in trying it. I suggested we have a small portion of my dish alongside a simple salad, but my partner declined, insisting they just wanted to stick to a familiar meal that they knew they would enjoy.

In a moment of frustration, I told my partner that it was unfair to dismiss my cooking without even trying it. I didn’t mean to sound dismissive of their preferences; I just wanted them to be open to new experiences. We ended up having a small argument about it, and I felt guilty afterward for being too pushy.

After some cooling-off time, we sat down and talked it through. My partner admitted that they can be closed-minded about trying new foods, and I acknowledged that I can sometimes push too hard when I’m excited about something. We agreed to compromise: I would continue to experiment in the kitchen, but I would also make sure to have a fallback meal ready for them, and they would commit to trying at least a taste of my new dishes.

They run various programs for different age groups, and I help with the after-school program for kids aged 8 to 12. Recently, a new girl joined the program, and she seemed really shy and hesitant to join in with the other kids. I noticed she would sit by herself during activities and hardly interacted with anyone.

One day, while we were working on a craft project, I decided to sit down next to her and try to engage her in conversation. I asked her about her favorite colors and if she liked any specific crafts. To my surprise, she opened up and started to share that she loved drawing and painting but felt nervous about showing her art to others. I encouraged her to share a drawing she had made, and I complimented her work, which made her smile.

Over the next few weeks, I continued to check in with her, and slowly she began to come out of her shell. She started participating more in group activities and even made a couple of friends. I felt really good about being able to help her feel more comfortable.

After a recent session, one of the other volunteers, who has been working at the center for years, pulled me aside and said that I seemed to have a unique way of connecting with the kids, especially those who are shy. She mentioned that it was important to help all kids feel included. I thought that was really nice of her to say, but it made me wonder if I was overstepping by focusing so much on one child.

A few months ago, my friend Sarah [28f] invited all of us to her birthday party, which was set to be a big bash since she was turning 30. She planned a weekend getaway for a small group of close friends, including me, and I was excited to celebrate with her.

As the date approached, I realized I needed to take some time off for a family commitment that came up unexpectedly.

My friend, Jake (30), is getting married to his long-time girlfriend, Emma (28). They’re a great couple, and I’m genuinely happy for them. However, Jake has this habit of being overly competitive, even about things that shouldn’t matter, like who can throw the best party or who has the best cooking skills. It's all in good fun most of the time, but sometimes it gets a bit much.

When Jake and Emma asked me to be the best man, I was thrilled. I wanted to make sure the bachelor party was memorable but also respectful of the couple's wishes. The thing is, Jake wanted to go all out with a big party that included wild activities, while Emma was hoping for something more low-key. So, I ended up trying to find a middle ground.

I organized a weekend camping trip for the guys, thinking that would be fun and give everyone a chance to bond. I planned a bunch of activities and even prepared a nice meal for the first night. Just as I was getting everything set, Jake got wind of the plans and flipped out. He wanted a big night out in the city, complete with a bar crawl and all the extravagance.

I tried explaining my perspective, that I thought Emma would appreciate a more relaxed celebration. He didn't take it well and accused me of not letting him have ""the best bachelor party."" I felt caught in the middle, and I didn’t want to ruin our friendship. So, I tried to compromise and ended up suggesting that we could do both—a camping trip and then a night out. 

In the end, Jake reluctantly agreed, but he wasn’t happy about it. The camping trip went pretty well, but during the night out, he kept making snide comments about how the camping was just a ""warm-up"" for the real party. It felt like he was trying to overshadow the effort I put in, and it was awkward.

Recently, she invited me to spend a weekend at her family’s cabin in the woods, which I was excited about. I love the outdoors and thought it would be a nice escape for both of us.

When we arrived, I quickly realized that her family had brought along their dog, a big, playful golden retriever. While I love dogs, this one was a bit overwhelming. It was super energetic and kept jumping up on me, which made me a little nervous. I tried to be friendly and play with the dog, but it kept knocking over my things and getting in my personal space. 

Throughout the weekend, I noticed that my girlfriend’s family was quite lax with the dog’s behavior. They would laugh it off when the dog was too rambunctious and would often encourage it to jump up on us, thinking it was cute. I felt a bit uncomfortable and tried to gently suggest that maybe they could train the dog to have better manners, but it didn’t go over well. My girlfriend looked a bit embarrassed and said that it was just how her family was with their pets.

Things came to a head on the last night when the dog accidentally spilled a drink all over my belongings. I had kept my cool throughout the weekend, but at that moment, I expressed my frustration a bit too loudly. I said something like, ""Can’t you guys control your dog a little bit?” It created a bit of tension, and my girlfriend’s family looked hurt, while she seemed disappointed in me.

After that, we had a conversation where she told me she understood my feelings but felt I could have handled it better. I apologized for raising my voice and explained that I just wanted to enjoy the weekend without worrying about my stuff getting ruined. In the end, we talked it out, and I think we both learned a bit about each other's perspectives.

TL;DR - I got frustrated with my girlfriend's family's dog during a weekend trip, and my reaction upset her family. We talked it out, but I wonder if I handled it the right way.",442,1712,0.81,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_41767,2024-01-19 00:00:00,NAH,2041,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I'm planning a small family gathering for my birthday next month. I’ve invited my close family, and we’re trying to keep it simple with a barbecue in the backyard. I asked everyone to RSVP with their food preferences because I want to make sure I have something for everyone. 

Most people responded with their choices, but my younger sister, who is vegan, didn't respond with a food choice. I assumed she might just be coming for the company and not the food, so I planned to have burgers, hot dogs, and a few sides like coleslaw and potato salad. 

A week before the gathering, she mentioned casually that she was excited but that she hoped I’d have something for her to eat. I felt a bit of guilt because I hadn’t explicitly planned for a vegan meal, thinking it would be just a casual get-together. I don’t mind making something for her, but I don’t want to go overboard either, especially since it’s my birthday and I’d like to keep things low-key.

I considered preparing a simple vegan option like grilled vegetables and a salad, but I also thought about her previous remarks that she prefers food that isn't just a side dish. After talking with my partner, we decided we could do a small vegan burger option as well, but I was worried about the extra work and expense. 

I ended up texting my sister, asking if she’d be okay with just a salad and some grilled veggies, and she said that was fine, but she would have liked a burger. I felt torn; I didn’t want to seem inconsiderate, but I also didn’t want to stress myself out with too much extra work for a small gathering.

Now I’m wondering if I should make the effort to include a special vegan burger for her or if it’s reasonable to just stick with what I already have planned. I genuinely want everyone to enjoy themselves, and I certainly don’t want to cause any tension. 

So, AITA for considering just serving what I originally planned or should I go the extra mile for a vegan option?",709,877,0.98,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_87751,2021-04-04 00:00:00,NAH,1952,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been together for a little over a year, and things have been going well overall. However, there's been an ongoing issue regarding my partner's younger sister, who is 16. She's a sweet girl but has been struggling with anxiety and depression for a while now. My partner is very protective of her and has tried to help her as much as possible.

Recently, my partner's sister reached out to me separately, asking if I could talk to her about some personal things. I was flattered that she felt comfortable coming to me, but I also didn’t want to overstep any boundaries. So, I discussed it with my partner first to see how she felt about it. My partner was supportive, so I agreed to meet her sister for coffee.

During our conversation, her sister opened up about her struggles, and I did my best to listen and offer support without giving her advice I wasn’t qualified to provide. It felt like a productive and kind meeting, and I genuinely wanted to help her feel better.

However, after our meeting, my partner seemed upset. She expressed that she didn’t think it was appropriate for me to talk to her sister without her being present. I understood her perspective and assured her that my intentions were purely to support her sister, but I also acknowledged that I might have crossed a line by not including her in the discussion.

We ended up having a long conversation about it. I apologized if I made her feel uncomfortable and reassured her that I would never want to undermine her role as a sister. At the same time, I explained that I thought her sister needed someone to talk to, and I wanted to help.

In the end, my partner and I agreed to set some boundaries moving forward. I'll be there for her sister, but only if my partner is comfortable with it and wants to be involved too. I feel like we both learned something from this experience, and communication was key.

Now I'm wondering if I was the asshole for meeting with her sister without my partner's knowledge or if it was a misunderstanding that we both grew from. What do you think?",374,2228,0.54,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_29204,2018-07-17 00:00:00,NAH,2075,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"A few months ago, I accidentally started a minor conflict with my roommate over our shared kitchen. We had agreed to a chore schedule, and I typically handle the dishes while she takes care of the trash and grocery shopping. One evening, I was exhausted after a long day at work and I noticed the pile of dishes had grown quite large. I decided to tackle it, but I didn't have time to do a thorough job.

I scrubbed the plates and pans quickly, but I didn't get to the silverware or the smaller items that were also piling up. The next morning, my roommate came into the kitchen and saw the mess I hadn't finished. She was frustrated and mentioned it to me, saying she felt overwhelmed with the chores. I could tell she was upset, and I apologized for not completing the task to my usual standard. 

Instead of arguing, we had a calm conversation about how we could better communicate our expectations. I offered to take on an extra chore the following week to make up for it, and she agreed that it would help ease the workload for both of us. We also decided to create a shared checklist so we could keep track of what needed to be done more easily.

In the end, while neither of us was really at fault, it was a misunderstanding that allowed us to improve our communication and teamwork. The situation was a good reminder that living together requires open conversation, especially when it comes to shared responsibilities. What do you think?

No one is the Asshole,"I recently moved into a new apartment and wanted to host a small gathering to celebrate. I invited a few close friends, and everyone seemed excited to come. One of my friends, Sarah, has a food allergy to nuts, which I’m very mindful of. 

To make sure everyone had something to eat, I carefully selected recipes that were nut-free. I even double-checked all the ingredients when I went shopping. However, I also wanted to keep things simple and decided to order a couple of pizza pies from a local place for the main dish, since it’s easy and everyone loves pizza. 

When I called to order, I specifically asked for a nut-free pizza option, but I didn’t realize that the restaurant had a strict warning that they couldn’t guarantee that their pizzas were free from cross-contamination due to shared equipment. I went ahead and placed the order, thinking I had done my due diligence.

On the day of the gathering, I mentioned to Sarah that there would be pizza but made sure to tell her about the cross-contamination issue. She appreciated the heads-up and decided to bring her own food instead to be safe, which I completely understood.

The gathering went well, and we all had a great time catching up. However, later that night, Sarah mentioned that she felt disappointed that I didn’t specifically make a nut-free option for her, and that she would have preferred if I had chosen a restaurant that could guarantee it. I explained my reasoning and the steps I took to ensure she was safe, but she felt that I could have done better.

I genuinely care about her well-being and didn’t mean to upset her. I think she has a point about wanting to feel safe with food at gatherings, but I also feel like I did my best considering the circumstances.

No one is the Asshole,"Background: My partner and I recently decided to host a small dinner party for some close friends. I was in charge of preparing the main dish, a lasagna, while my partner took care of the appetizers and desserts. We spent the whole day cooking and setting up, and by the time our friends arrived, everything was ready and we were excited to enjoy the evening together.

As the night went on, I noticed one of our friends, Sarah, seemed a bit off. She wasn’t eating much and looked uncomfortable. After asking her if she was okay, she revealed that she was lactose intolerant but hadn’t thought to mention it before the dinner. I felt awful because I had made the lasagna with a lot of cheese, not considering that she might have dietary restrictions.

After dinner, I apologized to Sarah and offered to make her something else, but she insisted it was fine and didn’t want to cause a fuss. I felt guilty for not checking with everyone beforehand about their dietary needs, especially since Sarah’s discomfort was visible.

Later, my partner and I were cleaning up when they expressed their frustration with me for not being more considerate about our friends' dietary restrictions. I understood their point, but I also felt like it was a collective responsibility to communicate needs in a group setting. We ended up having a calm discussion about it, and I acknowledged that I could have done better while also pointing out that I didn’t know about Sarah’s intolerance beforehand.

TL;DR: I made a lasagna for a dinner party without knowing one friend was lactose intolerant. They didn’t mention it and felt uncomfortable.

Last week, I had some friends over for a small gathering, and I ended up using the living room a lot, as we played games and watched movies. I made sure to clean up after everyone left, but I didn’t have time to do a deep clean since I had an early meeting the next day.

The next morning, I woke up to a text from my roommate saying they were really frustrated with the mess left in the living room. They mentioned it was unfair for them to have to clean up after my friends, and that they felt like I should have done a better job. I completely understood their point of view, but I also felt a bit blindsided since I thought I had cleaned up what was necessary.

I texted them back, apologizing for not thoroughly cleaning and explaining my situation with the early meeting. I offered to do extra chores around the apartment for the next few days to make up for it. They accepted my apology, and we had a calm conversation about how we can communicate better in the future if something like this happens again.

No one is the Asshole,"I have a close friend, Sarah, who has been going through a tough time lately. She recently lost her job and has been feeling really down and anxious about her situation. I wanted to support her, so I invited her to a small get-together I was hosting for a few mutual friends.

Leading up to the event, I noticed Sarah was texting me a lot with questions. She wanted to know who would be there, what food I was serving, and if she could bring her therapy dog. I completely understood her need for reassurance, but it started to feel overwhelming. I was trying to plan a fun night for everyone, and her constant need for details was making me anxious too.

On the day of the gathering, Sarah arrived with her dog, which I was fine with; I just hadn’t planned for it. My apartment isn’t very spacious, and I worried about how the dog would interact with everyone. When I saw how tense Sarah was about the dog being there, I tried to diffuse the situation by suggesting we keep the dog in a separate room during dinner. I thought it would help her relax and enjoy the evening.

Unfortunately, Sarah took it the wrong way and became upset, saying she felt like I didn’t want her there. I reassured her that wasn’t the case, and I genuinely wanted her to have a good time. After some back and forth, we managed to come to a compromise where her dog could stay in the room but could come out for a little while when we were eating.

The night ended up being a success, but I felt bad about how stressed Sarah seemed, and I worried I might have hurt her feelings. I want to be supportive and create a space where she feels comfortable, but I also need to maintain my own boundaries and not feel overwhelmed.

Now, I’m wondering if I should have handled the situation differently. I care about Sarah and want to help her, but I’m unsure if I overstepped by suggesting the dog not be out during the meal.

No one is the Asshole,"So a bit of background: my family has always been very into sports and physical activities. Everyone plays something, from soccer to basketball, and my parents have always pushed me to be involved in sports teams since I was little. I, on the other hand, have never really been into traditional sports. Instead, I found my passion in arts and music. I’ve been playing the guitar since I was 10 and spend most of my time writing songs and performing.

Over the years, my parents have constantly expressed disappointment in my lack of interest in sports. They would often say things like, “You should join the soccer team; it’s a great way to make friends!” or, “You need to stay active! You can’t just sit around playing that guitar all day!” I’ve tried to explain to them how much music means to me, but it always ends in frustration, with them insisting that I’m wasting my potential.

Recently, I had a major performance at a local venue. It was a big deal for me, and I was super excited. I invited my parents, hoping they would finally see how passionate I am about music. They decided to come, but while I was performing, I noticed they were texting on their phones and chatting with each other instead of watching me. It really hurt to see them so uninterested.

After the show, I confronted them about it. I told them how much it meant to me that they would support me, and it felt like they couldn't care less about something I love. My mom got defensive and said they were just trying to lighten the mood because my songs are ""too sad."" My dad chimed in, saying they thought I’d be happier if I played sports instead.

In the heat of the moment, I raised my voice and said that I was tired of them treating my passion like it was worthless. I told them that I would be proud of my accomplishments in music, and if they couldn’t support me, then maybe they shouldn’t come to my shows. It was a tense moment, but I felt like I finally stood up for myself.

Afterward, I felt kind of guilty for yelling and making them upset, but at the same time, I thought it was important for them to understand how I felt. They later apologized and said they didn’t mean to upset me; they just didn’t realize how important this was to me.

So, AITA for confronting my parents about their lack of support for my music?",0,1389,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_76033,2019-12-16 00:00:00,NAH,2310,AITA

He looked lost and scared, with matted fur and a collar that seemed a bit too loose for his neck. I approached him slowly, and he wagged his tail but didn’t come to me. I could see that he didn’t have any tags, so I decided to check around the area for any signs of his owner.

After searching for a while and asking a couple of neighbors if they recognized him, I realized nobody knew where he belonged. Concerned for his safety, especially with cars passing by, I decided to take him home. I took him to the vet to get him checked for a microchip, hoping to find his owner that way.

The vet confirmed he didn’t have a chip, and they estimated he had been out for a while based on his condition. I bought some supplies, food, and gave him a bath to clean him up. Over the next couple of days, I put up flyers in the neighborhood and posted on social media, trying to find his owner. 

Eventually, I got a message from someone who recognized him from the flyer. They came over to pick him up and were extremely grateful. While they thanked me profusely, they also admitted that he had a habit of escaping because they had a broken fence. They promised to fix it to ensure he wouldn’t get lost again.

Jake is a nice guy, but he often makes inappropriate jokes that make me uncomfortable, especially about sensitive topics. 

One evening, we all hung out together, and during the night, Jake made a particularly distasteful joke about mental health. Sarah laughed at first, but I could see she was a bit taken aback. Afterward, I pulled her aside and expressed my concerns, saying I thought Jake’s humor was insensitive and could potentially hurt people, including her.

Sarah thanked me for my honesty but didn’t seem overly concerned. She explained that Jake had a different sense of humor and that it didn't bother her as much. I respected her feelings but told her I felt it was important to let her know how I felt, especially as her friend.

A few weeks later, while we were out for coffee, Sarah mentioned that she had a tough week because of something Jake had said, and it had upset her. I listened and offered support, but I couldn't help but express my worry about how his jokes might affect her in the long run.

Recently, I've been feeling overwhelmed with work and needed some space to recharge. I suggested we both take a weekend to do our own thing, to focus on self-care and personal interests.

My partner initially agreed, but as the weekend approached, they started feeling anxious about being apart. They expressed that they would rather spend the time together, and at first, I thought it was sweet. However, I really needed this time for myself to unwind, especially after a particularly stressful month at work. 

I tried to explain my feelings, but my partner insisted that they didn't want to feel lonely or abandoned. They mentioned how they had a rough childhood and often felt alone, which made me feel guilty about wanting to take that time for myself. I reassured them that it wasn't about them at all; I just needed some personal space to recharge. However, they responded by saying that they felt like I was prioritizing my needs over our relationship.

I ended up compromising and agreed to spend half the weekend together, but my partner was still upset. They felt like I was giving in but not genuinely wanting to be with them. I could sense that they were hurt, and it made me question if I should have just let go of my need for alone time to avoid conflict.

One day, while we were cleaning the kennels, Jamie shared her dream of opening her own animal rescue one day. She had done extensive research and even had a business plan in place. I found her passion inspiring and supportive, but I also felt a bit intimidated. I’ve always loved animals, but I’ve never thought of taking on such a huge responsibility myself.

As we talked, I mentioned how I admire her ambition, but I also expressed my concerns about the financial and emotional toll of running a rescue. I said I wasn’t sure if I could handle that level of commitment. Jamie got a bit defensive and said that if everyone thought that way, there would be no rescues at all.

My aunt had organized the event, and I was excited to reconnect with everyone. As the day went on, we were all gathered for a group photo, which my aunt insisted was a must-have to commemorate the occasion.

When it came time to take the picture, my aunt realized she didn’t have anyone to hold the camera while she joined the group. She asked if I could step in and take the photo for her. I agreed, but just as I was about to take the picture, my uncle, who was joking around, suggested I should stand in the photo too since I was already there. My aunt encouraged this and insisted I join the group.

I hesitated because I had a bit of a rough week and wasn’t feeling my best. I didn't want to ruin the picture with my insecurities.

We've been close friends for over ten years, and we've always supported each other through various life events. Recently, Sarah went through a tough breakup, and I did my best to be there for her, offering emotional support and listening to her feelings.

However, during this time, I also made plans to attend a wedding out of state. The wedding was for my cousin, who I really wanted to support, and I had RSVP'd months in advance. The dates overlapped with Sarah's emotional struggles, and when I told her about the wedding plans, she got really upset. She felt that I was choosing family over her in her time of need.

I tried to explain to her that I still wanted to be there for her, but I had committed to the wedding and already made arrangements. I offered to help her out on the days leading up to the wedding and promised to check in on her regularly while I was away. Despite this, she remained hurt and accused me of being a bad friend.

In the end, I went to the wedding, but I felt guilty about leaving her when she needed support. I communicated with her throughout the weekend and reached out as soon as I returned. She seemed to cool off after some time, and we had a good conversation about it. We both acknowledged the importance of being there for each other, even during busy times.

So, here’s the situation. My best friend and I have been friends for years, and we recently started working together on a project for a community event. We were both excited about it, and I thought we had a good rhythm going. However, during our meetings, I noticed my friend seemed a bit off and not as engaged as usual.

One day, I decided to bring it up. I asked her if everything was okay and if there was something bothering her. She ended up opening up about feeling overwhelmed with her personal life and the pressure of the project. I felt bad for her and wanted to help, so I offered to take on more of the workload to ease her stress. 

However, instead of being grateful, she seemed annoyed and said that I shouldn’t have to take on more just because she was struggling. She mentioned wanting to pull her weight and not wanting to feel like a burden. I understand where she was coming from, but I genuinely wanted to help.

After our conversation, we spent a bit of time trying to understand each other’s perspectives. I explained that it’s okay to lean on friends sometimes, and she admitted that she appreciated the offer but felt conflicted about it. We decided to continue working together but agreed to communicate more openly about our workloads moving forward.

I’m now left wondering if I overstepped by offering to take on more work, or if my friend was just being overly sensitive about the situation.

I recently started a new job at a small marketing firm. It’s a great opportunity, and I like the team. During my first week, I noticed that one of my coworkers, Sarah, seemed to be struggling with her workload. She’s been there longer than I have and is generally very competent, but she seemed overwhelmed with a project that was due soon.

I offered to help her out, thinking it would be a nice gesture. She gratefully accepted, and we spent a couple of afternoons working together. However, I quickly realized that I was taking on a lot of the heavy lifting. While I didn’t mind pitching in, it started to feel like I was doing the bulk of the work, and it was cutting into my own deadlines.

After a few days, I decided to have a candid conversation with Sarah. I let her know that I was happy to help but that I also needed to focus on my responsibilities. She understood and apologized for the situation, saying she hadn’t meant for it to turn into a one-sided effort. We agreed to split the work more evenly moving forward.

However, some of my other coworkers have since commented that they think I should have just let Sarah manage it on her own. They argue that I might have been enabling her by stepping in, and that I should have set clearer boundaries from the start.

I feel like my intentions were good, and I genuinely wanted to help a colleague in need. I didn’t want to seem unsupportive or make her feel bad about needing assistance.

Lately, Jake has been going through a rough patch in his life. He's been struggling with his job and dealing with some personal issues, and I've been trying to be supportive.

Last week, we were having a game night at my place, and Jake seemed particularly down. I wanted to cheer him up, so I suggested we play some of his favorite games and I even made some snacks. However, during the night, Jake started to get really intense and competitive, which is normal, but he started to take things too far. He was making fun of people's mistakes and got a bit rude when things didn't go his way.

At one point, I called him out on it, saying something like, ""Hey man, this is just for fun. We’re all here to enjoy ourselves."" He got defensive and said I was ruining the vibe and that he was just being passionate about the game. I tried to explain that there’s a difference between being passionate and being hurtful, but he didn't want to hear it.

After that, the mood at the gathering shifted, and some friends started to leave early because they felt uncomfortable. I felt bad because I just wanted to help him, but I also thought it was important to address his behavior. I reached out to him later that night to apologize if I hurt his feelings, but I also expressed that I think he needs to be more mindful of how he interacts with everyone, especially when they’re already feeling down.

I decided to decline the invitation for lunch, thinking it would be better to take some time to settle in and get to know people gradually. When I told my team leader that I wouldn't be joining them, she seemed disappointed but understood. However, a few weeks later, I overheard her discussing how I was ""not a team player"" because I hadn't participated in the lunches. This made me feel really bad, as I had no intention of coming off that way.

I later spoke to her privately about how I felt. I explained that I genuinely appreciated the invitation but needed a little more time to feel comfortable in such a social setting. To my relief, she was understanding and apologized for making assumptions. She mentioned that she would encourage team members to be more mindful of varying comfort levels when it came to social activities.

In the end, I started joining them for lunch gradually, and I found that getting to know everyone was easier once we broke the ice over a meal.

No one is the Asshole,"I’m a woman in my late twenties, and I recently had a situation at my local gym that left me feeling a bit unsettled. 

I usually go to a small gym where I know most of the staff and members. It's a friendly atmosphere, and I’ve made a few friends there. One day, I noticed a new trainer, a man in his thirties, who seemed to be very enthusiastic about his job. He was friendly and often approached people to offer tips or advice during their workouts, which I thought was nice.

However, during one of my sessions, he approached me while I was doing my routine and started giving me unsolicited advice on my form. I appreciate feedback, but the way he did it felt a bit overbearing. I politely thanked him but mentioned that I was okay and just wanted to focus on my workout. He seemed a bit taken aback but backed off.

A few days later, during a group class, he made a comment about how women often struggle with lifting weights, and I felt uncomfortable. I understand he didn’t mean it in a malicious way, but as a woman who lifts regularly, it felt like he underestimated my abilities. After class, I decided to talk to the gym manager about it, not to get him in trouble, but to express how his comments could be taken the wrong way.

The manager appreciated my feedback and said she would have a chat with him to make sure he is more mindful of how he communicates. I thought that was the end of it, but I later found out from some other gym members that the trainer felt embarrassed and was upset about being reported.

I didn’t intend to hurt anyone’s feelings, and I truly believe he was just trying to help. I was just looking out for myself and others who might feel uncomfortable. 

In hindsight, I wonder if I should have approached him directly to express my feelings instead of going to management. But I also feel like he should be more aware of how he communicates, especially in a mixed-gender environment.

No one is the Asshole,"I (28F) recently got invited to a family reunion after several years of not attending. I’m not super close with my extended family, but I figured it might be nice to reconnect, especially since my cousin, who I was really close to growing up, was going to be there. 

As the day of the reunion approached, I noticed my excitement was a bit overshadowed by anxiety. I have a habit of fidgeting with my hands, and over the years, I developed a nervous tick where I often pull at my hair when I'm stressed. I’ve tried various methods to cope with it, but it’s something that still happens occasionally. 

At the reunion, things were going well at first. We were all catching up, sharing stories, and laughing. But then, my cousin (30M), who I thought would be supportive, made a comment about my hair. He said something like, ""Wow, you’ve really lost a lot of hair. Are you alright?"" I know he meant it as a joke, but it stung, especially since I was trying to keep my anxiety in check that day. 

Instead of responding with a snarky remark, I decided to just brush it off with a smile. But later, when we were alone for a moment, I confided in him about my nervous tick and how I’ve been struggling with it. I told him that comments about my hair were hurtful, even if they were meant in jest. 

To my surprise, he apologized sincerely. He told me he had no idea and promised he would be more sensitive in the future. I appreciated that he listened, and we ended up having a good conversation about mental health and how we all have our struggles. 

Later in the day, I overheard some aunts and uncles joking about my cousin's comment, but they were doing it in a light-hearted way. I felt a bit awkward since I knew I was the topic of their conversation, but I realized they weren't being mean-spirited. They were just trying to lighten the mood and connect. 

My brother, who still has a bit of a chip on his shoulder about family dynamics, called me later and said I should have stood up for myself more in front of the whole family. He argued that I let my cousin get away with making a hurtful comment, and by not saying anything in the moment, I made it seem like it was okay for him to joke like that. I explained to him that I didn’t want to make a scene at a family gathering and that my cousin had apologized to me privately. I just felt like everyone was trying to have fun and not be hurtful.

Now, I’m left wondering if I should have confronted my cousin in front of everyone or if I handled it in the best way possible by addressing it privately. I don’t think anyone was an asshole in this situation, but my brother seems to think I should have been more assertive.

(TLDR at the bottom)

I have a close friend, Jenna, who is incredibly passionate about her photography. She’s been taking pictures for years and has a unique style that I really admire. Recently, she decided to enter a local photography contest that had a substantial cash prize. She was super excited about it and spent weeks preparing her submission, and I could see how much it meant to her.

As the contest date approached, Jenna started to get nervous about her chances of winning. She asked me for my opinion on her photos, and while I think they’re great, I noticed that they didn't quite fit the theme of the contest. The theme was quite specific, and I had a feeling that the judges might be looking for something different. I hesitated but ultimately felt it was important to be honest with her, given how much she was investing emotionally in this.

So, I gently told her that while I love her work, I felt her submission might not align perfectly with the contest theme. I encouraged her to consider submitting something else that might resonate more with the judges, but I also made sure to emphasize that her talent was undeniable, and she should be proud of her work no matter the outcome.

Jenna was initially taken aback and seemed a bit hurt by my feedback. She thanked me for my honesty but felt discouraged and worried that her work wouldn't be appreciated. I didn’t want to crush her enthusiasm, but I felt it was better to be truthful than to let her submit something that might not have the best chance of winning.

After a day of reflection, she reached out to me and said she appreciated my honesty, even if it stung a bit. She decided to tweak her submission to fit the theme better, and while she still included some of her original photos, she felt more confident about her chances.

TLDR: I told my friend her photography contest submission might not fit the theme, and while it hurt her initially, she ultimately appreciated my honesty and adjusted her submission. Was I wrong to give my opinion?",453,2159,0.78,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_41290,2021-01-31 00:00:00,NAH,2088,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So here’s the situation: I (22F) have a close friend, Jake (22M), who I've known since high school. We have a pretty tight-knit friend group that regularly hangs out, but recently, things have felt a bit off. 

Jake has always been super passionate about photography, and he recently got a new camera that he’s really excited about. He’s been capturing a lot of moments during our hangouts, which is great because he shares those photos with all of us. However, I noticed that he started posting the pictures on his social media without tagging anyone or mentioning our friends in the captions. 

Last weekend, we had a big get-together, and Jake took a ton of photos. I really enjoyed spending time with everyone and felt like we made some great memories. But when he posted the pictures, he just focused on the artistic aspects and didn’t mention our group or anyone in it. I felt a bit hurt because it seemed like he was more interested in showcasing his skills rather than celebrating our friendship. 

I decided to talk to him about it. I approached him calmly and explained how I felt. I said that while I appreciate his talent, it would mean a lot to me if he acknowledged our group in the posts, just as a way to celebrate the time we spend together. Jake listened but seemed a bit defensive at first, saying he thought of the photos as art and didn’t want to dilute their impact with tags or captions. 

After some back and forth, we reached a good understanding. He apologized for not considering how it might come across and agreed to include us more in his social media posts. I also acknowledged that I might have come off a bit strong, and that I understand he has his artistic vision.

No one is the Asshole,"I’ve been married to my husband for three years, and we both have very busy careers. Unfortunately, my mother was diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer’s about a year ago. Since then, we’ve been trying to figure out the best way to support her. My father passed away a few years ago, and my mom has been living alone. 

In the beginning, I took it upon myself to visit her every weekend and help her with groceries, errands, and just being someone to talk to. My husband has been incredibly supportive, and he often comes with me to help out. However, my brother, who lives in another state, rarely visits or offers help, claiming he’s too busy with work and his own family.

Recently, my brother called me and suggested that we should hire a professional caregiver to help our mom, which I agreed was a good idea. However, he then dropped the bomb that he wanted me to cover the entire cost since I lived closer and “had more flexibility.” I was shocked and felt it was unfair to put that burden on me alone. I told him I would be happy to contribute, but it should be a shared responsibility.

Our conversation escalated into a heated argument, and he accused me of not caring about our mother enough because I was unwilling to pay for her care by myself. I explained that I’ve already been dedicating so much time and effort and that it’s not just my responsibility. He ended the call frustrated, and I felt upset too.

Afterward, I talked to my husband about it, and he suggested that we both could reach out to our mom and see what she feels she needs. We decided to set up a family meeting to discuss it openly, including how we can both contribute to her care financially and emotionally.

My college roommate and I were inseparable during those years. We shared everything from late-night study sessions to weekend adventures, and I always thought we would remain close after graduation. However, things took a turn after we both started our careers in different cities.

1.) About a year after graduation, I went through a tough breakup. I reached out to her, sharing my struggles and looking for support. Initially, she responded with kind words and offered to call, but when I tried to set up a time, she was always busy with work or her new social life. I understood that she was busy, but it felt like I was reaching out more than she was.

2.) A few months later, I got a promotion and was excited to share the news with her. I texted her, but it took her over a week to respond—a brief message congratulating me, but nothing more. I tried to invite her to a celebratory dinner, and she declined, saying she had plans with other friends, which felt a bit disheartening.

As time went on, I noticed we were in different places in our lives. I would share experiences like traveling or new friendships, and while she would sometimes respond, it felt more like obligation than genuine excitement for me. Meanwhile, she shared updates about her life, which seemed to revolve around her new friends and her job successes. 

Eventually, I started feeling drained by the one-sided nature of our communication. I decided to step back from reaching out. It wasn’t easy, but I felt like I was always the one making an effort. After a few months of silence on my end, she sent me a message asking if I was okay, and if we could catch up. 

I hesitated to respond, not wanting to re-enter a friendship that felt imbalanced. I wondered if it was time to cut ties entirely or if I should give it another chance. My question is: Am I the asshole for stepping back and potentially ending a friendship that I felt was one-sided?

A few weeks ago, I noticed Tom was having a rough time. He had been dealing with some personal issues, and I could see he was stressed and withdrawn. Despite this, I tried to reach out by inviting him over for coffee a couple of times, but he always declined, saying he wasn’t up for it.

Tom seemed overwhelmed and started to withdraw again, saying he appreciated my concern but didn’t really want advice—he just needed someone to listen. I immediately recognized my mistake and apologized, acknowledging that I had crossed a line by not respecting his need for space and just being a sounding board.

Recently, though, I've noticed that Jake has become increasingly withdrawn. He used to be really enthusiastic about our plans, but lately, he often cancels last minute or seems unmotivated when we do hang out.

A few weeks ago, I planned a hiking trip to a new trail I thought he would love. I was really looking forward to it and even bought some snacks and drinks for the day. The day before the hike, Jake texted me saying he wasn't feeling up to it and suggested we just stay in and play video games instead. I understood he might be going through something, but I was also really disappointed.

I told him I was bummed out because I was excited about the hike, and he apologized, saying he just didn't have the energy. I didn't want to pressure him, so I agreed to the game night instead. However, as the night went on, I couldn't shake the feeling of frustration. I felt like I was always the one pushing for us to do fun things, and it hurt that he didn't seem to care as much anymore.

Here’s the background: I’m part of a close-knit friend group, and we all met in college. There are five of us: me, A, B, C, and D. We’ve always been there for each other through thick and thin, and I really value these friendships.

However, things took a turn recently when D started dating a girl, E. She’s really nice, but there’s been some tension because D seems to be prioritizing her over the rest of us. We all noticed that he’s been canceling our hangouts and not responding to our messages as quickly. A, B, and C have been vocal about how we miss our time together and feel like we’re losing D.

One evening, we had planned a game night that D had agreed to for weeks, but last minute, he canceled to go out with E instead. A was really upset and expressed his feelings to D, saying that he felt neglected and that we should at least have some time as a group without E. D got defensive and said that he deserves to spend time with his girlfriend. The whole conversation escalated into a fight where everyone ended up saying things they regretted. 

After that, I felt caught in the middle. I understand that D is happy with E, but I also miss our friend group dynamics. I didn't want to take sides, so I tried to remain neutral, but the tension was palpable. I didn’t reach out to D because I felt like he would just brush off my concerns like he did with A.

Eventually, I decided to talk to D one-on-one. I told him I didn’t want to interfere with his relationship, but it’s important to me that we still find time to hang out as friends.

No one is the Asshole,"**UPDATE**

So, I took everyone’s advice and decided to have a little get-together with my friends and my dad. I invited a couple of my close friends who have been supportive throughout this whole ordeal, and I also asked my dad to join in for brunch. I thought it would be good for him to meet my friends and just have a relaxed day together.

When my dad arrived, he was a bit apprehensive at first. He’s not the most social person, and meeting new people can make him anxious. But my friends were super welcoming and made an effort to include him in the conversation. They asked him questions about his hobbies and interests, and he started to open up a bit. It was really heartwarming to see.

During brunch, we shared funny stories, and my dad even shared a couple of his own. We laughed, and by the end of it, he seemed much more at ease. My friends even complimented him on his storytelling skills, which I think made him really happy. 

Afterwards, we all decided to play some board games, and my dad got really into it! He was laughing and joking, and it felt like a huge weight had been lifted. It was such a relief to see him enjoying himself and connecting with my friends.

I think it really helped him realize that it’s okay to be around people, and that he can have fun even if it’s outside his comfort zone. I’m so grateful for my friends for being so understanding and kind, and I feel like this experience brought us all a little closer together. 

Thanks to everyone who suggested I give this a try! It turned out to be a good day for all of us, and I think it really helped my dad feel more connected.",546,2889,0.69,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_62345,2023-06-24 00:00:00,NAH,1621,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I'm 28 years old and have been working as a graphic designer for about six years. I genuinely enjoy my work, but recently I've been feeling a bit unfulfilled. This is mainly due to the fact that my company has been going through some changes, and my role has become more about managing client expectations rather than focusing on creative design, which is what I love most about my job.

I've been thinking about taking a leap into freelance work. The idea of being my own boss and having the freedom to choose projects that fuel my passion excites me. However, I also know that freelancing comes with its own set of challenges, including unstable income and the need for self-discipline. I’ve spent a lot of time considering this decision, and I honestly believe it could lead to a much happier and more fulfilling career for me.

Recently, I brought this up with my partner, who I’ve been with for three years. He is incredibly supportive, but when I mentioned my plans to transition to freelancing, he expressed concern. He is currently in a stable job that he enjoys, and he worries that if I freelance, it might put financial pressure on us, especially since we’ve been talking about buying a house in the next year or two and starting a family shortly after.

I understand his fears, and I appreciate his perspective. He’s all for me pursuing my passion but wants to ensure that we’re financially secure and on the same page for our future goals. We had a lengthy discussion about it, during which I reassured him that I’m willing to take things slow and perhaps start freelancing part-time while keeping my current job until I feel ready to fully transition. 

He seemed relieved by this compromise, but I can't shake the feeling that I might be holding onto my current job longer than necessary just to accommodate his worries. I don’t want to prioritize my desire to transition over our mutual goals, but I also don’t want to sacrifice my happiness in the process.

So, in essence, I want to know if I’m being selfish for wanting to pursue my passion when it might cause some uncertainty in our plans, or if we’re just navigating a normal conversation about career aspirations and future goals together.",413,809,0.73,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_25615,2022-09-12 00:00:00,NAH,2212,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, I (19M) was at my friend's (19F) birthday party, and it was a decent gathering with a mix of people we both knew, as well as a few of her new friends. As the night went on, we were playing games, and everyone was having a great time. At one point, we decided to take a break and went outside to chill.

While we were outside, my friend started opening up about how she feels pressured to look a certain way, especially with social media making everything seem so perfect. I could tell she was feeling pretty low about herself, and I wanted to be supportive.

She asked me what I thought about some of her new outfits she had been trying out lately. I told her that I thought she looked great and that she should wear whatever makes her feel confident. However, I noticed she seemed a bit unconvinced. So, I tried to reassure her by saying that everyone has their own style and that it’s important to dress for yourself, not for others.

Then she jokingly asked if I thought she could pull off a certain look she was considering for an upcoming event. I told her something like, “Honestly, it might be a bit bold for you, but if you love it, go for it!” I think she took it a bit too seriously because she went quiet for a moment.

Later on, she pulled me aside and said she was really hurt by my comment. She felt like I was discouraging her instead of encouraging her, and I genuinely didn't mean to upset her. I explained my intention was to support her, not to bring her down. We talked it out for a bit, and in the end, we both understood each other better.

After that, we returned to the party and continued having fun. Some of her friends later found out about the situation and said that I should have been more careful with my words.

No one is the Asshole,"So I (M 22) recently went on a hiking trip with a group of friends, including my buddy Jake (M 23) and his girlfriend Sarah (F 21). The plan was to spend the weekend in nature, enjoying the outdoors and getting away from our busy lives.

On the first day of the trip, we set out for a long hike to a scenic overlook. The trail was challenging, and as we climbed, we all started to feel a bit worn out. I noticed that Sarah was struggling a little more than the rest of us, but she kept pushing through. I admired her determination, but I also knew that everyone’s safety is important when hiking.

Around halfway up, I suggested that we take a break so everyone could catch their breath and hydrate. Jake was a bit impatient and wanted to keep going, but I thought it was best to listen to Sarah and let her rest a bit. I asked Sarah if she wanted to take a longer break, and she nodded, looking grateful. 

While we were resting, I started talking to her about some hiking tips and how to pace oneself on tough trails. I shared my own experiences and encouraged her to set her own pace rather than trying to keep up with us. Jake, however, seemed frustrated that we were taking too long and said something along the lines of, “Come on, we’re just wasting time!” 

I tried to calm him down, explaining that it’s important to listen to our bodies and that we should support each other, but it just led to a bit of tension. Sarah looked uncomfortable, and I could tell she felt caught between us. 

Eventually, Jake relented, and we decided to continue on after our break. The rest of the hike was challenging, but we made it to the overlook, and Sarah was really proud of herself. Jake apologized for getting frustrated earlier, and I assured him I understood where he was coming from. 

After the hike, we all talked it out, acknowledging that it was a tough situation for everyone. In the end, we all just wanted to support each other and enjoy the trip. I think we learned a lot about communication and patience with our friends.

So, was I wrong for insisting on the break when it seemed like Sarah needed it, even though it frustrated Jake? I just wanted to make sure everyone was okay.",211,1898,0.59,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_84728,2020-12-19 00:00:00,NAH,2190,AITA

I have two older brothers, and we all have kids of our own now. A few months ago, we decided to have a family reunion since it had been a while, and all of us were excited to catch up. My brothers and I have always had a friendly rivalry, and we thought it would be fun to organize some games for the kids and even some silly competitions for the adults.

During the planning, I suggested a friendly trivia quiz about our childhood and family memories. I thought it would be a great way to bring everyone together and share some laughs. My brothers agreed, but one of them, Tom, started taking it a bit too seriously and wanted to create a more competitive atmosphere with prizes. 

On the day of the reunion, we had a great time with the games. However, during the trivia quiz, Tom got really competitive and started calling out answers as soon as the questions were read. This frustrated everyone, including his kids, who were trying to participate. I tried to keep things lighthearted and suggested we take turns answering, but Tom insisted on being first for most questions, which led to some tension.

After the reunion, Tom expressed to me that he felt like I undermined his enthusiasm and that he just wanted everyone to enjoy themselves in a spirited way. I understood where he was coming from, but I also felt like he overshadowed the fun we were trying to create. I apologized if my actions made him feel that way, but I also believe that it’s important for everyone to have a chance to participate fairly.

We both care about our family and want to have enjoyable gatherings, so I think we both had valid points. I genuinely want to understand if I handled the situation wrongly or if it was just a misunderstanding.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I recently got a new job after being unemployed for a while, and I’m really excited about it. My best friend has been supportive through my job search, often helping me prepare for interviews and keeping my spirits up. To celebrate my new role, I decided to throw a small get-together at my place and invited close friends.

When I sent out the invitations, I mentioned that I would be providing snacks and drinks, but everyone was welcome to bring something if they wanted. My friend, however, took it upon himself to organize a potluck-style gathering and started messaging everyone to bring specific dishes. I appreciated the enthusiasm, but I felt a bit overwhelmed since I had planned everything already.

When the day of the party arrived, I noticed that my friend had brought an entire buffet's worth of food, essentially turning my small celebration into a full-on dinner party without checking with me first. While I loved that everyone pitched in, it ended up being way more food than I had anticipated, and I felt like my original plan for a casual get-together was lost.

Throughout the night, I tried to express my gratitude to my friend for wanting to help, but I also gently mentioned that I had a specific vision for the party. He seemed a bit hurt and defensive, saying that he was just trying to make it special for me.

In the end, everyone had a good time, but I felt a bit frustrated that my input wasn’t considered. I care about my friend and appreciate his support, but I wish we could have worked together on the planning. I’m not sure if I should have been more assertive or if he overstepped in trying to help.

I (32F) have been with my partner (34M) for about 5 years, and we recently decided to host a family gathering at our home. We both love entertaining, and it’s always nice to catch up with family. However, we faced a bit of a dilemma because my partner’s younger sister (17F) has been struggling with some mental health issues lately, and we were unsure if she should join us for the gathering or not.

My partner and I discussed it and decided that it would be better for her to come. We thought it might help her feel included and supported, especially since family gatherings can be uplifting. We reached out to her and she seemed excited to join.

On the day of the gathering, everything was going well. Our family was having fun, laughing, and enjoying each other's company. But as the evening went on, I noticed that my partner’s sister was becoming increasingly withdrawn. She was sitting quietly in a corner, not participating in any of the activities or conversations. I could see she was struggling and it tugged at my heart.

I gently approached her and asked if she was okay. She opened up about feeling overwhelmed and anxious in a large group. I completely understood and respected her feelings, so I suggested that we could take a break from the crowd. I led her to a quieter room where we could talk, and I offered her some snacks and a cozy blanket. We chatted for a while, and I encouraged her to express how she was feeling.

Meanwhile, my partner was socializing with other family members and seemed unaware of the situation. After some time, I went back to get him and let him know that his sister was feeling anxious and needed a little support. He was surprised and immediately came to check on her.

Together, we decided it would be best for her to leave the gathering early. We assured her that it was completely okay to step away when she felt overwhelmed. She appreciated our understanding and left feeling loved and supported.

After the gathering, my partner and I talked about the situation. He thanked me for being there for his sister and acknowledged that he hadn’t realized how difficult it was for her until I pointed it out. We both agreed that it’s important to prioritize mental health and support one another. 

I felt good about how we handled the situation, but part of me wondered if we should have just canceled her attendance altogether. I want to make sure everyone feels comfortable and included, but I also don’t want to miss out on family connections.

A few weeks ago, I invited Mia to a small gathering at my house to celebrate my birthday. I was really excited, and I put a lot of effort into planning it, including decorations and snacks. I sent out invitations to our close friends, and I specifically mentioned that it was going to be a laid-back event. 

The day of the party, Mia texted me saying she wouldn’t be able to come because she had made last-minute plans with another group of friends. I was disappointed but understood that sometimes things come up. However, I later found out from another friend that Mia went to a bigger party that same night instead. 

Feeling hurt, I confronted her the next time we were together. I brought up how I felt about her choosing that party over mine, especially since I had put so much effort into my celebration. Mia got defensive and said she didn’t mean to hurt my feelings, but she felt that my party would be too small and low-key compared to what her other friends were doing. She said she wanted to have fun and didn’t think I’d be upset since it was just a small gathering.

We ended up having a heated discussion, both of us feeling misunderstood. I told her I felt like she didn’t value our friendship enough to prioritize my special day. She said I was being dramatic and that it was just a party. We both walked away feeling hurt and frustrated.

So, I (30M) have a younger sister (25F) who is getting married next month. We’ve always had a close relationship, and I’m excited for her big day. However, my sister has a very specific vision for her wedding and has been planning everything meticulously, including the music.

A few weeks ago, I was chatting with her and she mentioned that she wanted her wedding to have a unique touch. She asked if I could play the guitar during the ceremony as a surprise for her and her fiancé. I was thrilled and agreed right away! 

However, I also mentioned that I had a song in mind that I thought would be perfect for them. It’s a song that I’ve loved for years, but it’s also one that I played for her many times growing up during family gatherings. I thought it would be a great way to add a personal touch. 

When I shared the song I wanted to play, my sister got really emotional and said, “That song is too special! It’s like our song, and I don’t want you playing it at my wedding.” I was taken aback because I thought she would appreciate the nostalgia and the connection it held for us. 

I didn’t mean to upset her; I just thought it would be a nice gesture. But she insisted that she wanted a completely different vibe for her wedding and that my choice of song wasn’t aligned with her vision. I offered to find another song, but she was still upset and said I was being selfish for wanting to play a song that meant a lot to me instead of focusing on what she wanted for her special day.

However, over time, I've noticed she has a habit of hosting loud parties late into the night, sometimes on weeknights. I'm all for having a good time, but it can get quite disruptive, especially when I have to wake up early for work.

I tried to address it directly with her a couple of times.

But then, the next party was just as loud, and it seemed like she didn’t take my concerns seriously.

So, I decided to write her a note expressing my concerns a bit more formally, suggesting that she might consider wrapping up the parties earlier or keeping the volume down. I didn’t want to come off as rude, and I hoped she would understand my perspective.

No one is the Asshole,"When I was in my mid-20s, I lost my best friend, Alex, in a tragic accident. We had been inseparable since childhood and had shared countless memories. Alex's family was like my second family; I spent so many holidays and vacations with them. After his passing, I tried to support them as best as I could while also dealing with my own grief.

A couple of years later, I started dating someone new, and we eventually got engaged. I was excited and nervous to share the news with Alex's parents. I wanted them to feel included in my life, as they had always been important to me. When I told them, they were happy for me, but I could see a shadow of sadness in their eyes. They mentioned how much they missed Alex and how they would have loved to see him get married. I understood that they were still grieving.

As the wedding approached, I invited them to come and be a part of the ceremony. I thought it would be a beautiful way to honor Alex's memory. However, during the wedding, they made several comments about how they felt like they were ""losing a child again"" and how they were so grateful to ""still have a piece of him"" through me. It was overwhelming for me and made me feel uncomfortable. 

After the wedding, I realized that they were still struggling with their loss and were projecting those feelings onto me and my marriage.

No one is the Asshole,"My friend and I have been close for several years, and we often do things together—like movie nights, game nights, and sometimes we even travel together. Recently, we planned a weekend getaway to a cabin in the mountains. 

As the trip approached, we discussed what food and drinks to bring. I suggested we split the grocery bill, and we both agreed on some essentials. However, I remember my friend mentioning that they have a severe gluten intolerance, which I respected. When I went shopping, I made sure to check all the labels carefully and bought gluten-free snacks and meals for us to enjoy at the cabin. 

On the day of the trip, when we were packing the car, I noticed that my friend had also brought some snacks that were definitely not gluten-free. I asked my friend about it, and they said, ""Oh, I figured I could just pick through them if I get hungry."" I felt a bit uneasy because I didn’t want to risk my friend getting sick, especially since we were going to be in the middle of nowhere.

I gently suggested that we could stick to the gluten-free options I had bought for the weekend, but my friend seemed annoyed and said, ""I can handle it, I promise."" I didn’t want to pressure them, so I dropped it, but I felt guilty for not being more firm about it. I wanted them to have a good time without worrying about their health.

Now, looking back, I wonder if I should have insisted more or if I overstepped by trying to control their choices. Am I the asshole for trying to protect my friend from their gluten intolerance during our trip? 

TL;DR - I bought gluten-free food for a weekend trip with a friend who has a gluten intolerance, but they brought their own non-gluten-free snacks and got annoyed when I suggested sticking to the gluten-free options. AITA?",93,1429,0.55,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_81242,2023-04-22 00:00:00,NAH,1778,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"A few weeks ago, I went to visit my older sister, who has a young daughter. I love spending time with my niece, and I try to be a good uncle. During this visit, my sister asked if I could help out with some babysitting while she went to run some errands. I agreed, happy to help.

While my sister was out, my niece and I were playing with her toys in the living room. She had a big basket full of different dolls and stuffed animals. At one point, I noticed a few of the toys were scattered around, so I decided to help tidy up a little. I put some of them back in the basket, but I also found an older doll that looked a bit worn out and had some stains. I thought it would be nice to clean it up, so I took it to the bathroom to wash it.

While I was cleaning the doll, my niece walked in and saw me. She got really upset and started crying, saying that I wasn’t allowed to touch her toys and that she wanted her doll back. I felt terrible; I hadn’t meant to upset her. I explained that I was just trying to help, but it didn’t seem to matter to her. 

When my sister came back, my niece told her what happened, and my sister seemed a bit annoyed with me, saying that I should have asked first before touching her things. I apologized and promised to be more careful in the future. 

I genuinely thought I was helping out, but I can see how it might have seemed like I was overstepping boundaries.

No one is the Asshole,"Recently, my neighbor decided to host a BBQ party in his backyard and invited everyone on our street. He’s known for being a great cook, and I was really looking forward to it. However, the day of the party, I had a sudden allergic reaction to something I ate earlier, and I knew I wouldn’t be able to enjoy the food.

I didn’t want to miss out on the social aspect, so I decided to go to the party and just hang out without eating. When I arrived, everyone was having a great time, and the aroma of grilled food wafted through the air. My neighbor, seeing me, insisted that I try some of his famous ribs. I explained my situation and that I couldn’t eat anything, but he kept pushing, saying he had made some grilled veggies that were safe for me.

Feeling a bit awkward, I accepted his offer. However, as soon as I took a bite, I realized there was a mix of marinade that I was allergic to. I immediately told him I couldn’t eat it and politely declined the rest. He seemed a bit embarrassed and apologized, but I assured him it was okay.

As the evening went on, I noticed other neighbors offering me plates of food, thinking I was just being polite by not eating. I felt uncomfortable and had to repeatedly explain my allergy, which led to a few awkward moments. Despite the initial hiccup, everyone was understanding, and we ended up talking about food allergies and how we can be more mindful.

After a while, I decided to leave, feeling grateful for the community, but also a bit frustrated that I had to repeat myself so many times. I talked to my neighbor afterward to thank him for the invite and let him know about my allergy, and he was really appreciative. 

I just wanted to share this experience and ask if I was the asshole for putting my neighbor in an awkward position or if it’s understandable given my situation. AITA?",83,2159,0.61,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_89509,2019-09-06 00:00:00,NAH,1838,AITA

A few days before the party, she shared a post about how she wanted everyone to bring a small gift that was either handmade or had a personal touch, as she was trying to create a more meaningful celebration. The idea was nice, but I was a bit overwhelmed with work and didn’t have the time to put together anything special. I decided to buy her a nice store-bought gift that I thought she would like.

On the day of the party, when I arrived, I noticed that most of our friends had indeed brought thoughtful handmade gifts. When it was time for her to open the presents, she was visibly happy with all the personal touches and creativity everyone had shown. When she opened mine, she smiled politely but then seemed a bit disappointed. She thanked me, but I could tell that my store-bought gift didn’t resonate the same way.

Later in the evening, she pulled me aside and mentioned that she appreciated the effort but hoped for something more personal. I felt bad and tried to explain my situation with work and how I didn't have the time to create something. She understood but still expressed that it hurt a bit because she was hoping for more thoughtfulness from her close friends.

I felt awful for letting her down, and I told her I was sorry if I disappointed her. I didn’t mean for it to come across as me not caring about her birthday. She appreciated the apology, and we ended up having a good talk about it. I think we both felt a bit awkward, but ultimately we were able to move past it.

In the end, I felt like neither of us was at fault. She wanted something special, and I didn’t deliver, but I also had my reasons.

We both have our own friends, and we enjoy having our separate social lives, but we also love hosting gatherings at our place.

Recently, I organized a small dinner party for some of my close friends, and I was excited to introduce them to my partner. I had planned the evening well in advance, coordinating with my friends to ensure everyone could make it. However, I found out a few days before the dinner that my partner had made plans to hang out with his friends on the same night. I was surprised because he hadn’t mentioned it before, and I had assumed we would be spending the evening together.

I expressed my disappointment to him, explaining how much I was looking forward to the dinner party and that I really wanted him to be there. He seemed a bit torn but ultimately decided to stick to his plans, saying he had been looking forward to this get-together with his friends for a while.

On the day of the dinner, after much thought, I decided to invite my partner to join us for at least part of the evening, thinking he might change his mind. He declined, saying he felt bad about splitting his time and wanted to stay with his friends. I respected his decision, but it still left me feeling a bit let down.

The dinner went on as planned, and my friends and I had a great time. My partner sent me a few texts during the evening, saying he hoped I was enjoying it and that he would love to hear all about it later.

So, here’s the deal: I have a cousin, let’s call her Emma, who is 15 and has always been very close to my family. I’m 22 and have always seen her as a younger sister. However, lately, I’ve noticed that Emma has been going through a bit of a rebellious phase. She’s started to dress differently, hang out with a new group of friends, and she’s even stopped caring about her schoolwork. 

Now, I care about Emma and want the best for her, but I also feel like I’ve been trying to be supportive in a way that she isn’t responding to. I don’t know how to approach her anymore because whenever I bring up concerns about her school or choices, she brushes me off and tells me I’m judging her. I understand that she’s a teenager, and they often want to assert their independence, but it’s hard to watch her head down a path that I feel could be detrimental.

Recently, during a family gathering, I made a comment about how I was proud of my own accomplishments and how important it is to stay focused on education. Emma overheard me and confronted me, saying that I was being condescending and that she didn’t need my “life advice.” I felt hurt because I genuinely was trying to share my experiences and encourage her, but I can see how it might have come off differently. 

Afterward, I felt conflicted. I didn’t want to undermine her feelings, but I also didn’t want to just stand by and watch her make choices that I think could lead to trouble. I decided to apologize to her for how I approached it, but I made it clear that I care about her and am always here if she wants to talk. 

Now I’m left wondering if I was the jerk for trying to give her advice or if she was overreacting. I’m just trying to look out for her, but I also want to respect her autonomy as a young adult. So, am I the asshole here?",121,2685,0.68,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_49688,2018-05-17 00:00:00,NAH,1899,AITA

Jake has always been a bit of a dreamer, and lately, he’s been passionate about starting a YouTube channel focused on gaming. He’s been putting a lot of time into it, and while I think it’s great he’s pursuing something he loves, I also worry about his future and the financial stability that comes with it.

A few weeks ago, Jake asked if I could help him with some of the initial costs, like a good microphone and a webcam. He mentioned that he would pay me back once he started earning money from his channel. I hesitated because I’ve seen so many people struggle to monetize their hobbies, and I didn’t want to encourage a risky investment that might not pay off. 

I decided to have an honest conversation with him about my concerns. I told him that while I support his passion, I think he should consider focusing more on his studies and perhaps starting the channel as a side project instead of investing money right away. I suggested he use some of his own savings or look for cheaper alternatives before committing to more expensive equipment. 

Jake got upset and accused me of not believing in him. He said I was being overly cautious and that I was stifling his creativity. I never intended to discourage him, but I felt that my concerns were valid given the precarious nature of making a living as a content creator. 

In the end, I didn’t give him the money, and he ended up buying a cheaper microphone with his own money.

I live on the second floor, and from the start, I noticed that the couple living directly above me tended to be quite loud, especially in the evenings and late at night. At first, I tried to brush it off, thinking maybe they just had a few late-night gatherings.

After a couple of weeks, it became clear that their noise levels were consistently disruptive. It would often wake me up or prevent me from relaxing after a long day at work. I considered approaching them directly about the noise, but I was worried about how they might react.

One evening, after a particularly loud night, I had reached my limit and decided to leave a polite note on their door. I wrote something along the lines of, ""Hi! I hope you’re doing well. I just wanted to let you know that the noise levels have been a bit high lately, particularly during late hours. I totally understand that everyone has their own schedule, but I would really appreciate it if you could keep it down a bit in the evenings. Thank you so much!""

The next day, I got a knock on my door. It was the couple, and they seemed genuinely surprised. They apologized and explained that they were unaware of how loud they had been. They assured me they would be more mindful in the future. We ended up chatting for a bit and even exchanged phone numbers to keep in touch.

Since then, the noise has decreased significantly, and I've gotten to know them better. We even hung out a couple of times, and they’re actually really nice people.

I’m not a fan of reality shows, and I expressed that to her, but she insisted that I should give it a try.

Last week, it was my turn to pick the movie, and I chose a classic romantic comedy that I love.

I tried to engage her by asking questions about the movie, but she just shrugged it off, saying she was “just tired.” Eventually, I got frustrated and said, “If you’re not gonna enjoy the movie, we can always just skip it next time and watch your show.” She laughed and said, “Fine, I’ll just watch it alone then.”

After the movie, she brought it up again, saying that maybe I should give her show a chance next time and that I was being a bit stubborn.

I work as a teacher in a diverse elementary school. Last week, I organized a special cultural day where students could share aspects of their heritage. I thought this would be a great opportunity for kids to learn from each other and celebrate our differences. Several students brought dishes from their cultures, and we had a potluck-style lunch.

One of my students, Amina, brought a traditional dish from her culture. During lunch, I noticed a few kids making faces and commenting on the smell of the food.

However, my partner's best friend, whom I’ll call Alex, has been going through a rough patch. Alex recently lost their job and has been struggling with their mental health. My partner is very empathetic and wants to support Alex as much as possible. The issue is that Alex has been increasingly relying on us for emotional support and often shows up at our apartment unannounced, sometimes just to vent or seek comfort.

I completely understand that Alex needs support, and I want to be there for them, but I also feel like our home is becoming a bit of an emotional dumping ground. I've tried to express to my partner that I think we need to establish some boundaries, especially since Alex’s visits can feel overwhelming and intrusive. My partner, however, is hesitant to set those boundaries because they fear it will hurt Alex or make them feel abandoned.

My partner was upset and felt like I was being unsupportive, which wasn’t my intention at all. I just want to make sure we have a healthy balance in our lives.

Lily laughed but then got serious and told me that the quilt was hers now and that she had plans to keep it displayed. I felt a bit hurt because I thought we could share the quilt and create new memories with it.

Over the summer, I worked part-time at a local coffee shop, and I was really excited to reconnect with my friends from high school who were back in town. One of my best friends, Alex, decided to throw a small gathering at his place to celebrate the end of summer, and he invited a few of our old friends as well as some new faces he had met in college.

The night was going well—everyone was catching up, laughing, and enjoying the snacks. However, as the night progressed, I noticed that one of the new friends, Jamie, seemed a bit withdrawn and uncomfortable. I wanted to include Jamie in the conversation, so I made an effort to engage with her. I asked her about her interests and tried to get to know her better.

At first, she responded politely but still seemed distant. I realized that she might not feel like she fit in with the group, so I suggested we play a game that I thought would break the ice. I thought it could help everyone bond and allow Jamie to feel more included. 

However, as we started the game, it became clear that Jamie wasn't really enjoying it. She seemed overwhelmed, and at one point, she asked if we could stop and just hang out quietly instead. I felt bad for not picking up on her discomfort sooner. I apologized and said it was totally fine to just chill, and we all switched gears to a more laid-back vibe.

The rest of the night went smoothly, but I felt guilty for not noticing Jamie's discomfort earlier. I talked to Alex later, and he reassured me that it was okay; we all have different social comfort levels and that it was great that I tried to include her. Still, I’m left wondering if I should have just let things be instead of trying to force interaction.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently moved into a new apartment complex and wanted to introduce myself to my neighbors. The first few weeks went smoothly, and I exchanged pleasantries with most. However, there was one neighbor, an older gentleman, who always seemed a bit gruff and unfriendly. 

One day, I decided to bake some cookies and thought it would be a nice gesture to share them with my neighbors, including him. I knocked on his door, and when he opened it, he looked a bit surprised. I offered him some cookies and tried to engage in small talk, but he seemed uninterested and just took the cookies without saying much.

A day later, I noticed he had left a note on my door, thanking me for the cookies but also expressing that he prefers not to interact much because he values his privacy. I felt embarrassed and a bit rejected. I didn’t mean to intrude on his space, but I just wanted to be friendly.

After that, I respected his wishes and stopped trying to engage him. However, I still say hello to the other neighbors when I see them.

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been together for six years and have a really strong relationship. Recently, we decided to plan a vacation to celebrate our anniversary, and we both agreed on a destination that we both love. I proposed that we do a road trip instead of flying, as I thought it would be a fun adventure.

A few weeks before the trip, my partner started to express some concerns about the long drive. They mentioned that they were feeling overwhelmed with work and didn’t think they could handle the stress of a lengthy road trip. I understood their feelings but was also really excited about the plan we had made.

I suggested that we could break up the drive with stops at interesting places along the way, which I thought would make it more enjoyable, but my partner was still hesitant. Eventually, I decided to book a couple of hotel stays for our journey to make it easier for us. I wanted to surprise them with a fun itinerary and make the trip feel special.

When I shared the itinerary with my partner, they were not thrilled. They felt like I had made decisions without fully considering their feelings and that it would be better to just fly to our destination to eliminate the stress of driving. I didn’t mean to upset them and thought I was doing something nice by planning ahead.

After some back and forth, we decided to compromise. We’re now flying to our destination but will take a scenic drive back home to enjoy the views and have some quality time together. We both realized that while we had different ideas about the trip, our main goal was to celebrate our anniversary and enjoy each other's company.

So, I guess I’m wondering, was I wrong to go ahead with my plans, or were we both just trying to make the best of a situation? Am I the asshole for wanting to stick with my road trip idea?",952,2435,0.54,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_63066,2020-03-04 00:00:00,NAH,1817,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"To provide some context, I (32M) have a younger sister (27F) who has been in a long-term relationship with her boyfriend (28M) for about five years. They've been talking about getting engaged, and my sister is excited about the prospect. As her older brother, I've always been protective of her, especially when it comes to her relationships. 

Recently, my sister invited me to a small family gathering where she planned to announce her engagement to her boyfriend. I was thrilled and excited for her, but I felt I needed to talk to her about my concerns regarding her boyfriend. Over the years, I've noticed that he can be dismissive of her feelings and tends to make jokes at her expense when we’re all together. I’ve seen her get upset by it, but she brushes it off. 

So, before the gathering, I decided to have a candid conversation with her. I expressed my worries and mentioned that I want her to be happy, but I also didn’t want her to overlook any red flags. My sister was understandably upset and felt that I was overstepping. She told me she loves her boyfriend and that I should trust her judgment. 

At the gathering, she ended up announcing her engagement, and while everyone was excited, there was a palpable tension between us. I could tell she was hurt by our earlier conversation, and I felt guilty for bringing it up. My intention was never to ruin her special moment, but I wanted to make sure she was aware of my concerns.

After the gathering, we had a long talk where she told me that while she appreciates my concern, she feels I should support her decision regardless of my personal opinions about her boyfriend. I apologized for how I handled it but also stood by my feelings. 

Now I’m wondering if I overstepped boundaries and whether I should have just kept my mouth shut since it’s her life and her relationship. What do you think?",589,1044,0.79,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_55017,2019-06-27 00:00:00,NAH,1862,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I (28F) have a complicated relationship with my younger brother (10M). Our parents divorced when I was 18, and since then, my brother has primarily lived with my mom. I moved out for college and have always been busy with work and personal commitments, so I haven't been as present in his life as I’d like.

When my brother was a toddler, I was heavily involved with him, reading him stories and playing games. However, as he grew up and I became more absorbed in my own life, I started to feel distant from him. I love him and care about him, but I sometimes struggle to connect with him like I used to. 

Recently, my mom reached out to me, excitedly planning my brother's 10th birthday party. She asked if I could help out and be there for him since he really looks up to me. I felt a mix of guilt and obligation. I wanted to support my brother and make him happy, but I also felt overwhelmed as I had a couple of important work deadlines that week.

On top of that, I had been looking forward to having a quiet weekend to recharge, as I had been feeling burnt out lately. I didn’t want to disappoint my brother, but I also didn’t want to overcommit and risk becoming resentful. 

After discussing it with a close friend, I decided to talk to my mom. I explained how much I wanted to be part of my brother's life and how I felt guilty for not being there as much. I gently told her that while I loved my brother, I wouldn’t be able to take on the extra responsibilities for the party this year. I suggested alternatives, like hiring a few friends of his to help out or having a smaller gathering instead. 

My mom understood, but I could tell she was a bit disappointed. I felt bad for letting her down, but I hoped that by being honest, I could still find a way to be involved without stretching myself too thin.

Now I’m left wondering if I made the right choice. Was I wrong for prioritizing my mental health over my brother’s birthday? I don’t want to come off as an uncaring sister, but I also don’t want to burn out.

No one is the Asshole,"Ok, so my (28) partner (27) and I have been together for about five years now, and we recently decided to adopt a dog. We both work full-time, and we thought a dog would add joy to our lives and help us grow together as a couple. We found a lovely rescue dog at a local shelter, and it felt like a perfect match.

Once we brought our new dog home, everything was great for the first few days. We were both excited and took turns walking him, feeding him, and training him. However, I noticed that my partner was getting a bit overwhelmed with the responsibility. They seemed to be struggling with the early mornings and late-night potty breaks as well as keeping up with the dog’s energy levels.

I had a few days off from work, so I decided to take on the majority of the dog care during that time to give my partner a break. I walked the dog, played with him, and handled the training sessions, hoping to ease some of the pressure off my partner. I thought it was a good idea to show support, but it quickly turned into me taking on almost all of the responsibilities.

After my days off ended, my partner expressed that they felt guilty for not doing more and worried that I was doing too much. They wanted to step up and share the responsibilities again, but I had gotten used to handling everything. I insisted that it was no problem, but I realized that I might have inadvertently restricted their involvement with our dog and made them feel inadequate.

Now, we’re at a point where I need to balance sharing the responsibilities more fairly and not overwhelming either of us. We’ve had discussions about how to handle dog care together, and it’s clear we both want to be involved. However, I still feel a bit guilty about how I took over everything and made my partner feel bad about their contributions.

So, I’m wondering if I’ve been the asshole for taking on too much and not encouraging my partner to be involved in the dog care as much as I should have. 

TL;DR – Adopted a dog with my partner, took over most responsibilities to help them out, but ended up making them feel guilty about not doing enough. Was I the asshole for taking over?",330,1898,0.59,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_39357,2024-03-02 00:00:00,NAH,2153,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I've been best friends with Sarah for over a decade. We’ve been through a lot together, and I truly care about her. Recently, she started dating someone, and while I was happy for her, I noticed some changes in her behavior that concerned me.

1. Sarah has always been a very independent person, but since she started dating Mark, she seems to have become almost entirely reliant on him for her happiness. She often cancels plans with me last minute to be with him, and when we do hang out, she frequently checks her phone for messages from him.

2. I’ve noticed that she now expresses doubts about her own interests and hobbies. For example, she used to love painting and would spend hours working on her art, but now she says she doesn’t have time for it because Mark prefers to do other activities. It’s as if she’s trying to mold herself into someone she thinks he would prefer.

3. One night, I brought up our old tradition of going to the art show together, and she said, “I don’t think Mark would enjoy that.” I was taken aback because I knew how much she loved it, and I felt sad for her. It seemed like she was putting her own interests aside just to please him.

4. When I tried to talk to her about how I felt, she got defensive and said I was being overly dramatic. She mentioned how happy she was with Mark and that I should just be supportive. I felt hurt because I was only trying to express my concern for her well-being.

I want to respect her choices and be a good friend, but I also worry that she might be losing herself in her relationship. I’m considering having a more candid conversation with her about it, but I’m unsure if I should just let it be and hope she realizes it on her own. My mom thinks I should intervene, but I don’t want to come off as controlling or unsupportive.

I love capturing candid moments and nature, and I often spend weekends going on solo photo walks. Recently, I decided to organize a small exhibition of my work at a local art space, which I was super excited about. I invited a few close friends and family, but my sister, who is not really into art, expressed that she didn't plan to come because she thought it would be boring.

I totally understood her perspective and didn't want her to feel obligated, so I told her that it was fine if she didn't want to attend. However, she later came back and said that she had reconsidered and would come to support me, which I appreciated. But the day of the exhibition, she arrived late and seemed a bit distracted, not really engaging with the artwork or the event.

At one point, I overheard her talking to one of my friends and she said something like, ""I don't get why she thinks this is a big deal; it's just photos."" I felt a bit hurt hearing that, but I also remembered that not everyone is into the same things and that it's okay if she doesn't understand my passion. After the event, I told her that I appreciated her coming but that it would mean a lot to me if she could be a bit more supportive in the future.

In the end, I think we both just had different perspectives—she didn't mean to be dismissive, and I didn't mean to pressure her into being more enthusiastic than she felt. We had a good chat about it, and I feel like we both came away with a better understanding of each other.

No one is the Asshole,"I (28F) recently organized a surprise birthday party for my best friend, Sarah (27F). We’ve been friends for over a decade, and I wanted to do something special for her since she’s been going through a tough time at work. I reached out to a few of her close friends and family members to help with the planning, and we all agreed to keep it a secret.

The party was set for a Saturday evening. I planned everything meticulously — the decorations, her favorite cake, and a playlist of songs she loves. I even booked a small venue to accommodate everyone. I was super excited and wanted it to be a memorable night for her.

However, I noticed that Sarah had been feeling a bit upset in the days leading up to the party. I asked her if she wanted to do something for her birthday, but she shrugged it off, saying she wasn’t in the mood to celebrate. I took that as a sign to go ahead with my plans since I thought maybe a surprise party would lift her spirits.

On the night of the party, Sarah arrived at the venue, and everyone yelled “surprise!” She looked shocked but then quickly turned to me with tears in her eyes. She told me that she really didn’t feel like celebrating this year and wished I had just asked her what she wanted instead of going ahead with the party. I felt terrible; I genuinely thought I was doing something nice for her.

I apologized and explained that I only wanted to cheer her up. She appreciated the effort, but still felt overwhelmed. After some heartfelt conversations, we both ended up laughing about it later, but I still felt like I might have crossed a line by not considering her feelings.

In the end, we decided to keep it low-key for the rest of the evening and just enjoy each other’s company. But now I’m left wondering if I should have consulted her first.

He lost his job a couple of months ago, and it’s really affected his mental health. He’s been quite down, and we’ve all been trying to support him as best we can.

A few weeks ago, Mark asked if he could stay with me temporarily until he gets back on his feet.

I have a pretty demanding job that requires a lot of focus and I also need my space to recharge after work. 

I told Mark that while I want to support him, I can’t have him living with me since my apartment is too small for both of us. I suggested that he could look into co-living spaces or a short-term rental nearby, and I offered to help him brainstorm job opportunities and apply for unemployment benefits.

Mark seemed hurt by my response, saying he felt abandoned during a time when he really needed support. I explained my reasoning and reassured him that I would always be there for him emotionally and with practical help in finding a job and a place to live. 

He calmed down but later expressed that he felt let down by my unwillingness to provide him with a place to stay. Now, I’m wondering if I was too harsh or if I should have made sacrifices to help him out. AITA for not offering him to stay with me?

Some Background...

My partner is a freelance graphic designer and works from home, while I have a traditional 9 to 5 job. This means I usually leave the house early and come back later in the day. My partner, on the other hand, has a more flexible schedule and sometimes works late into the night. 

At first, we tried to split chores evenly, but I noticed that despite being home all day, my partner wasn’t able to keep up with some of the household tasks, like laundry and dishes. I thought that maybe they were overwhelmed with work, so I tried to pick up the slack without saying anything. Over time, I started to feel resentful because I felt like I was doing more than my share.

One day, after a particularly long week, I came home to find the dishes piled up and laundry still undone. I had a moment of frustration and brought it up during dinner. I expressed my feelings and said I thought it would be fair if we could sit down and come up with a better system, as I was starting to feel overwhelmed.

My partner listened and explained that they had been struggling with managing their work and household duties and hadn’t realized I felt this way. They felt guilty for not keeping up and admitted it was hard for them to transition into a more structured routine. We ended up having a really productive conversation and agreed to find a balance that works for both of us.

Despite the initial awkwardness, I think we both learned a lot about communicating our needs and the importance of teamwork. I’m feeling good about our compromise, but I also can’t shake the feeling that maybe I overreacted by bringing it up the way I did.

One of my friends, Sarah, mentioned earlier in the week that she had been trying a new diet and wasn't sure how much she would eat. I completely understood and told her it would be no problem if she wanted to bring a small dish that fit her diet or just join us for drinks. She said she would think about it.

When the dinner came, I had made a variety of dishes that catered to different tastes, including some gluten-free and vegan options. However, Sarah showed up with a large platter of her own food, which was a completely different meal from what I had prepared. It was enough to feed all of us, and it seemed like she was trying to show off her cooking skills rather than participate in the meal I had planned.

While I appreciated her effort, I felt a little hurt because I had hoped everyone would enjoy the food I made and feel a part of the evening. Throughout the dinner, she was quite vocal about her dish and encouraged everyone to try it, which somewhat overshadowed the meal I had prepared.

She hesitated, and I could see she was uncomfortable. In a misguided attempt to encourage her, I walked over to her and jokingly added, ""Don’t worry! Just don’t fall off!"" It was supposed to be light-hearted, but I didn’t realize how much my comment affected her. Sarah’s face went pale, and she visibly tensed up. She managed a weak smile but didn’t move any closer to the edge.

After a moment, I realized I might have crossed a line. I apologized sincerely, saying I didn’t mean to make her feel bad and that I should have been more considerate of her feelings. We talked it out, and I assured her that her comfort was more important than any picture.

Sarah is known for her incredible baking skills, and she often brings in treats to share with the team.

Last week, Sarah baked a batch of her famous chocolate cookies and brought them to the office. I was really excited, as I have a sweet tooth, and everyone was raving about how delicious they were. I had a few, and they were as amazing as everyone said. 

Later that day, I noticed a couple of cookies were left over, and since I had enjoyed them so much, I asked Sarah if I could take a couple home to share with my family. She smiled and said that was fine, and I happily put them in a container to take home.

The next day, we had a team meeting, and Sarah announced she would be baking again for a work potluck next week. I mentioned how much I loved the cookies she had made previously and said that I took some home to share. That’s when I noticed her expression change slightly.

I (24F) have a younger sister (20F) who has always been very passionate about animals. She’s currently studying veterinary medicine and spends a lot of her time volunteering at local shelters. I’ve always admired her dedication and have supported her interest in any way I could. 

Recently, she decided to adopt a dog from a shelter. She found a cute little mutt that had been abandoned and fell in love with him. She named him Max and brought him home. I was really proud of her for taking this step, but I noticed a few things that concerned me. 

Max has a lot of energy and hasn’t been trained properly. He jumps on people, barks excessively, and tends to chew on things around the house. My sister has been trying to manage him, but it’s clear that she’s overwhelmed. I offered to help her train him, suggesting we enroll him in some obedience classes together, but she brushed it off, saying she wanted to do it her own way.

One weekend, I invited some friends over for a small gathering. I told my sister in advance and asked her if she could keep Max in her room during the event, as I was worried about him being too much for my friends who weren’t used to dogs. She agreed but seemed a bit irritated. 

During the gathering, Max managed to sneak out of her room and ran into the living room. He barked excitedly and started jumping on my friends, which made everything chaotic. I tried to calm him down, but it took a while before I managed to get him back on a leash. Afterward, I talked to my sister and suggested that maybe she should consider some training for him, so he wouldn’t be such a handful, especially around guests. She got defensive and said I was being judgmental and that she was handling it in her own way.

Now I feel bad because I didn’t mean to upset her. I just wanted to help her with Max, and I thought it would make things easier for everyone. But I also understand that she’s really passionate about this and might feel like I’m undermining her abilities. 

AITA for suggesting my sister train her dog better? 

Edit: I didn’t expect this post to gain so much traction. I appreciate everyone’s feedback. I’ve realized that while I want the best for Max, my sister really does care for him deeply and may just need some time to find her footing as a new dog owner. I’m planning to have an open conversation with her about my concerns without coming off as controlling. Thank you!",740,874,0.76,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_54733,2018-07-12 00:00:00,NAH,2478,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I recently attended my cousin's wedding, and it was a beautiful ceremony. I was genuinely happy for her and her partner, but there was something I didn't anticipate: the overwhelming emotional atmosphere. Everyone around me was crying tears of joy, and while I appreciated the love and the moment, I found myself feeling a bit detached.

During the reception, my family was sharing heartfelt speeches about love, commitment, and the magic of finding ""the one."" I could see how deeply these stories resonated with everyone, but I struggled to connect with the sentiments being expressed. I’m not a cold person; I've just never been in a serious relationship, and I don't really understand the intensity of those emotions. 

As the night went on, I noticed several family members looking at me with concern. At one point, my aunt leaned over and asked if everything was okay, since I was so quiet. I smiled and assured her I was fine, but it became clear that my lack of visible emotion was raising eyebrows. I felt awkward, as if I was failing to meet some unspoken expectation. 

I did my best to join in on the celebrations, dancing and laughing with my family, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was out of sync with everyone. It made me feel guilty, as if I was somehow disrespecting the occasion by not fully participating in the emotional aspects of it. I wondered if my indifference made me seem callous or ungrateful, and that thought bothered me.

After the wedding, I talked to my cousin about the day, and she reassured me that everyone experiences emotions differently. She pointed out that not feeling the same way doesn't mean I was any less supportive of her. It helped to hear that, but I still felt a twinge of discomfort about my emotional disconnect.

In the end, I believe there was no malice from anyone; we were simply navigating our feelings in different ways. I care about my family, and I wanted to celebrate with them, even if my emotional experience didn't match the collective sentiment. It was a learning moment for me, highlighting how diverse human emotions can be, especially in significant life events.",812,1258,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_41789,2019-07-08 00:00:00,NAH,2139,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So I'm a woman in my late 20s, and I recently started a new job at a tech company. It's been a great experience, but I noticed that I often feel out of place during team lunches or social gatherings. Most of my colleagues have been in the industry for a while and have a lot of shared experiences or inside jokes that I just don’t relate to because I’m new.

One day, during lunch, the conversation turned to a team project that took place before I joined. Everyone started sharing stories and laughing, and I felt really left out. I wanted to contribute something to the conversation, so I ended up exaggerating my previous work experiences to seem more relatable and involved than I actually am.

Afterwards, I felt guilty about not being honest. I know I shouldn’t have felt pressured to fit in and that it’s perfectly normal to be new and still learning, but I was just trying to make connections.

No one is the Asshole,"I (30F) recently found myself in a tough spot with my younger brother (25M) and his girlfriend (25F). My brother has been with his girlfriend for about two years, and they seem really happy together. I like her a lot, and we’ve gotten along well.

A few weeks ago, my brother shared with me that he wanted to propose to her. He was excited and asked for my help in planning a memorable proposal. I was thrilled to help and suggested that we organize a family gathering where he could pop the question. He loved the idea and we started to plan it.

Here’s where things got complicated. A few days later, my brother’s girlfriend confided in me that she was feeling anxious about the proposal and how she might react. She mentioned that she wasn't sure if she was ready for marriage yet, even though she loved my brother. She didn’t want to hurt his feelings, though. I promised her that I wouldn’t say anything to him about her concerns.

After thinking it over, I felt stuck. I wanted to support my brother, but I also didn’t want him to be blindsided if she really wasn’t ready for this big step. So, I made the tough decision to talk to my brother. I didn’t tell him everything she said, but I hinted that he should consider having a conversation with her about their future before proposing.

When I brought this up, my brother was upset. He told me that I had ruined the surprise and that he was really looking forward to proposing. He felt I should have just kept my mouth shut and let him go through with his plans. I apologized, but I stood by my decision to bring up his girlfriend’s feelings.

The next day, my brother’s girlfriend reached out to me, expressing her gratitude for my honesty, saying she felt relieved to have a chance to talk to him before the proposal. They ended up having a heartfelt conversation, and it turned out that my brother understood her feelings and decided to wait a bit longer before proposing.

Now, there’s some tension between my brother and I. He’s not angry, but he feels let down that I didn’t trust him enough to let him handle things. I’m feeling conflicted. I wanted to protect his feelings, but I also didn’t want him to be hurt unknowingly.

Last week, she invited me over for dinner, and when I arrived, I noticed that her boyfriend was acting overly controlling. He kept interrupting her when she spoke, and it felt uncomfortable. During dinner, he made several passive-aggressive comments about her past relationships, which I thought was inappropriate. 

After they finished eating, Lisa and I went to the living room to catch up. I gently mentioned that I was concerned about how her boyfriend treated her. I told her that I thought she deserved someone who respects her and values her opinions. She got defensive and said I was overreacting. I reassured her that I just wanted the best for her, and we ended up having a bit of a heated conversation about it.

Later, her boyfriend overheard us and got angry. He accused me of trying to manipulate her, which I definitely didn’t intend to do.

No one is the Asshole,"Throwaway account because I don't want anyone I know to find this.

Backstory: I grew up in a small town where my family has lived for generations. My grandparents opened a local bakery that became a beloved spot in the community. After they passed, my parents took over the bakery, and it’s now a family-run business. I’ve worked there since I was a kid, but my passion lies in graphic design, not baking.

I’m now 26 and have built a career as a freelance graphic designer. Recently, I got a great opportunity to work for a prominent design agency in a big city. This job would mean a lot to me, both professionally and personally, as it aligns perfectly with my goals. However, it also means I would have to move away, and I haven't told my family yet.

I know this would upset my parents. They’ve always seen the bakery as a family legacy, and I’m the only child. They’ve made it clear that they want me to take over the bakery one day, but I’m not passionate about it. I love the bakery and appreciate the hard work my family has put into it, but I feel that I would be doing a disservice to both myself and the business if I took it over just to please them.

I’m torn between pursuing my dream job and the guilt I feel about potentially abandoning the family business. I want to talk to my parents about it but I’m scared of how they’ll react. I believe they’ll see it as me turning my back on our family legacy, and I don’t want to hurt them.

So, if I decide to take the job and move, would I be an asshole for doing so? I feel like I’m caught in a tough spot and would really appreciate some outside perspective.",362,984,0.94,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_90658,2020-06-20 00:00:00,NAH,1622,AITA

Recently, Sarah invited me to her first solo art show, which was a big milestone for her. I was excited and planned to attend, but I also had a prior commitment that I had forgotten about—a family event that I couldn't miss. I felt terrible about it but explained to Sarah that I had to prioritize my family obligation.

On the day of the art show, I sent her a message wishing her luck and telling her how proud I was of her. I thought that would suffice. However, she texted me back, clearly upset, saying that she had really wanted me to be there, and it felt disappointing that I chose family over her big moment.

I completely understand her feelings, but I also felt torn because family events are important to me, and I didn’t want to let them down either. I reached out and offered to meet up with her afterward to celebrate, but she seemed uninterested, saying she needed some time to process her feelings.

My friend Jake and I have been inseparable since high school. He’s always been the life of the party, and I admire his spontaneity. Recently, he decided to throw a surprise birthday party for his girlfriend, Sarah, and he wanted me to help him plan it. I was on board, and we spent weeks organizing everything together.

However, about a week before the party, Sarah mentioned to me in passing that she was feeling overwhelmed at work and stressed in general. I could tell she needed a little encouragement, so I thought it would be nice to suggest a relaxing evening where she could unwind before the big celebration. I casually dropped the idea of taking her out for a nice dinner on the night before the party, not knowing that Jake had already planned a surprise dinner for them on that same night.

When Jake found out, he was understandably upset. He felt like I had undermined his surprise and that I should have known better. I tried to explain that I was just trying to help Sarah feel better, and I didn’t realize the timing would conflict with his plans. We talked it over, and though he was frustrated, he appreciated my intentions and we managed to work things out. I ended up telling Sarah about the party so she wouldn’t have any conflicts, and Jake adjusted his plans accordingly.

Yet, I still feel bad about the whole situation. I didn’t mean to create tension between us, and I genuinely wanted to help Sarah. But I also understand that surprises are important too, especially for someone like Jake. I just wish I had been more mindful of the timing. AITA for suggesting the dinner with Sarah?

However, I also have a close friend, Amy (32f), who is going through a tough time after a recent breakup. We had planned a girls' night out on the same night as Mia’s exhibition, which I had promised to attend to help Amy feel better.

When I realized that both events were on the same evening, I felt torn. I knew how much this exhibition meant to Mia, but I also wanted to support Amy. I decided to talk to Mia about it. I explained my situation and told her that I would help her set up the exhibition during the day, but I would need to leave by 5 PM to meet Amy later in the evening.

Mia was initially disappointed and expressed that she felt let down, as she had counted on my support for the whole evening. I reassured her that I would be there for the setup and that I would come back after my commitment with Amy, if possible, but it might be late. I suggested that she call a few friends to help in case she needed more support after I left.

Mia eventually understood my dilemma and agreed to my plan, though it was clear she was still frustrated. I felt guilty for having to split my time, but I wanted to be there for both my sister and my friend.

I come from a large extended family and we all value our connections deeply. Every year, we have a big family reunion where everyone gets together, including aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandparents. It’s a tradition that we all look forward to. My cousin Alex, who is around my age (30), has always been a bit of a jokester and loves to poke fun at everyone in good spirit.

At this year's reunion, we were sitting around the fire, reminiscing about old times and telling stories. At one point, Alex made a comment about how I was still single and jokingly suggested that I should just adopt a dog instead of waiting to find a partner. Everyone laughed, including me, but I felt a bit self-conscious about my relationship status. I brushed it off, but Alex continued to push the joke further, saying things like “Maybe you could find a dog that looks like you!” 

After a while, I started to feel uncomfortable and decided to speak up. I said, “Hey, Alex, I know you’re just joking, but it’s actually a sensitive topic for me. It’s hard to be single at my age, and I’d appreciate it if you’d stop.” He immediately apologized and said he didn’t mean to hurt my feelings. The mood shifted a bit, and the group went back to lighter topics.

Later on, I overheard Alex talking to another cousin, and he was still making jokes about my single status.

I was in the middle of falling asleep when my roommate came home at around midnight. She was clearly a bit loud and had some friends over, laughing and talking in the living room.

During our planning, F1 suggested we go to a cabin in the mountains for some peace and quality time. I was totally on board and excited for some girl time, but then I mentioned how my partner, who I’ve been dating for a year, had been feeling a bit left out since I’ve been spending time with F1 and F2 without him lately. 

F2 then casually asked if I thought it would be okay for him to join us. I hesitated because I sensed F1 was leaning towards it just being us girls. I brought up the idea of him coming along, thinking it might be fun to have him there, especially since he loves the outdoors. F1 seemed a bit put off and said something like, “I just thought it would be nice to have a girls' weekend, but if you really want him to come, that’s fine.” The way she said it made me feel like I was imposing.

I could see how F1 might feel that way since she recently went through a tough breakup and perhaps wanted this time to bond with me. I also didn’t want to make her uncomfortable, but at the same time, I didn’t want to exclude my partner who has been really supportive.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I need some advice on a situation that's come up with my friends. We’re planning a weekend camping trip in a couple of weeks, and about 8 of us are going. 

I have a 2010 Subaru Outback, which is pretty spacious but definitely has its limits when it comes to passengers and gear. Last time we went camping, we tried to fit too much stuff and a couple of larger friends, and it felt cramped and uncomfortable for everyone.

Now, for this trip, my friends want to pack even more gear and bring along the same larger friends, but I’m worried about how much space there is. I mentioned that we should probably think about splitting up the gear and people to keep the ride comfortable, and I suggested using one of the other cars available. 

The thing is, I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings, especially since one of the friends is quite sensitive about his size. I didn’t mention that my main concern is space and comfort, so I’m thinking about how to approach it in a way that doesn’t make it seem like it’s about him.

I really want everyone to have a good time, but I also want to avoid being stuck in a cramped car for hours. What do you all think? Am I overthinking this, or is it fair to suggest we take a second vehicle?",165,1537,0.52,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_16905,2019-02-23 00:00:00,NAH,1231,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, a few days ago, my close friend and I were planning a weekend trip together. We’ve known each other for years, and we usually get along great. The trip was meant to be a fun escape, a chance to relax and catch up. 

As we were finalizing our plans, I suggested we invite another mutual friend, someone we both really like but hadn’t spent much time with lately. My friend hesitated and mentioned that they were feeling a bit anxious about having a third person along since they prefer one-on-one time when we travel. I completely understood their perspective, as I sometimes feel the same way.

However, I genuinely thought our mutual friend would add to the experience, so I insisted that we should invite them. After some back and forth, my friend reluctantly agreed, saying they would try to be open-minded about it.

When we got to the trip, things started off well, but I noticed my friend seemed a bit withdrawn and uncomfortable. I tried to encourage them to engage more, but it was clear they were not enjoying the dynamic. I felt bad because I didn’t want to make them feel trapped or unhappy.

After a day of this, I realized I might have overstepped by pushing the invitation. I talked to my friend privately and apologized for not fully considering their feelings. They appreciated my honesty and acknowledged that they should have communicated their discomfort better rather than just agreeing to it. We both agreed that it’s okay to have different preferences in social situations, and I assured them that I wouldn’t put them in that position again.

In the end, we both learned something valuable about communication and respecting each other’s boundaries. It was a bit awkward, but I think we both handled it with understanding and care. 

So, I’m curious, am I the asshole for insisting on inviting another friend when I knew my close friend might be uncomfortable with it?",625,622,0.89,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_79674,2019-11-06 00:00:00,NAH,1894,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I know this may sound like I’m being unreasonable, but hear me out. I’ve always been supportive of my older brother’s decision to pursue his passion for music, but it reached a point that I found difficult to manage.

He’s in his late twenties and has been working on his music career for a while now. He often practices at home, and while I admire his dedication, he tends to play his guitar and sing at all hours of the day and night. I live in a small apartment, and the walls are thin. 

Lately, he has been rehearsing well into the night, sometimes past midnight, which makes it hard for me to sleep since I have an early job. I tried to talk to him about it gently, explaining that I love his music but that the late-night sessions were really affecting my sleep and work. He assured me that he would try to keep it down but that he needed to practice to get better.

A week later, nothing changed. So, I decided to be more direct. I told him that I would appreciate it if he could limit his practice to reasonable hours, perhaps stopping by 10 PM. I suggested he could practice during the day when I’m at work, but he told me that’s when he feels most productive and inspired.

In a moment of frustration, I told him that if he couldn’t respect my need for quiet hours, I would have to consider finding a new living situation or getting noise-canceling headphones. I didn’t want to make him feel like he had to choose between his passion and living with me, but I felt like I was at my wits' end.

After our conversation, we both took a step back and realized that we weren’t really communicating effectively. We talked again, and he understood where I was coming from. He agreed to work on a schedule that allowed him to practice during the day when I was out, and I promised to be supportive of his music career.

We ended up finding a compromise that worked for both of us, and I feel relieved to have that conversation. I just hope I didn’t come off as the bad guy when I was really trying to find a solution that respected both our needs. 

So, AITA for setting boundaries around noise in our shared living space?",802,690,0.67,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_98010,2018-04-28 00:00:00,NAH,2125,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My [38M] best friend [37M] just went through a tough breakup with his girlfriend of several years. It was hard for both of them, and we’ve been trying to support him as best as we can. He’s been a bit down, so I invited him over to my place for a guys' night to help lift his spirits.

During our night in, we played video games, watched movies, and just talked about everything. At one point, he started opening up about his feelings regarding the breakup, and I could see how much he was hurting. I wanted to be supportive, so I listened and offered my thoughts when he asked for them.

He then mentioned that he was feeling a bit lost and didn't know where to go from here. I suggested he might consider exploring some new hobbies or interests to help distract himself and find some joy again. He seemed receptive to the idea, and we started brainstorming some options.

A couple of days later, he called me and said he was thinking of taking a pottery class, something he had always wanted to try but never got around to. I thought it was a fantastic idea! He was excited, but then he mentioned he wasn't sure if he should go through with it since he didn’t want to seem like he was “moving on” too quickly from the relationship.

I assured him that it was perfectly okay to explore new things and that it didn’t mean he was forgetting about his past relationship. I reminded him that healing means rediscovering oneself and that focusing on personal growth is a part of that process. He seemed to feel better after that conversation and decided to sign up for the class.

Later, he told me that he really appreciated my support, and it felt good to know I could help him in a small way during a tough time. It got me thinking about how important it is for friends to be there for one another, especially during difficult transitions.

Last week, I had a particularly rough day at work and was feeling overwhelmed. My partner had mentioned wanting to go out for dinner and a movie, but I just wanted a low-key night in. I asked if we could order takeout instead and catch up on our favorite show. He seemed a bit disappointed but agreed.

As the evening went on, I noticed my partner was still somewhat withdrawn, so I tried to lighten the mood by joking about how we could have a fancy takeout dinner and pretend we were at a restaurant. However, I could tell he wasn't really laughing, and I began to realize that he had his heart set on going out.

In hindsight, I probably should have picked up on his feelings better. After dinner, he told me that he felt like I didn't care about our time together and that it was important for us to go out and enjoy each other's company in that way. I apologized and told him I thought we could have a nice evening at home, but I could see how that might not have been what he was looking for.

We talked it over, and I acknowledged that I should have considered his feelings more deeply before suggesting a night in. He admitted that he could have communicated his feelings better too instead of holding onto his disappointment. 

In the end, we both realized we were coming from a place of wanting to connect and support each other, but we just missed the mark that night.

However, her wedding is on a Saturday, and the Friday before, I have a work commitment that I can't miss. I work in a small team, and I'm the only one who can cover this particular event, so I can't just take that day off.

I talked to my friend about my situation, hoping to find a solution. I suggested that I could drive to the wedding after finishing my work on Friday and get there late that night. I would still be there for the ceremony on Saturday, but I would miss out on the rehearsal dinner and some pre-wedding festivities. 

My friend was understanding initially, but then she mentioned that it would feel like I was missing out on important moments and that she really wanted me to be part of everything. She expressed disappointment about me arriving late. I completely get her feelings, but I can't just skip work.

After thinking it over, I decided to go ahead with my plans, but I offered to help her with anything she needed to prepare for the wedding in the days leading up to it. I also promised to make up for missing the pre-wedding events by taking her out for a special lunch when I see her. 

In the end, I made it to her wedding and had a wonderful time, but I still feel a bit guilty for not being there for everything.

We both have been feeling the pressure, and I suggested that we should have a brainstorming session to come up with a solid plan. Sam seemed hesitant and expressed that he preferred to work alone to avoid distractions. I totally understand where he’s coming from because I can be the same way, but I also believe collaboration could really enhance our final output.

Later that day, during lunch, I brought up the idea again in a more casual manner, thinking it might help him see the benefits of brainstorming together. I said something like, “I feel like if we bounce ideas off each other, we might come up with something amazing!” Sam got a bit defensive and said he was fine working on his own and didn’t want to change his approach just because I thought it would be better.

I felt bad for pushing the idea, so I quickly backed off and said, “Okay, I totally understand. It’s just a thought!” I didn’t want to make him uncomfortable or feel pressured, so I dropped the subject. However, I noticed that he seemed a bit upset after the conversation, and I didn’t mean to make him feel that way.

After our lunch break, I talked to another coworker, Jamie (28F), about it, and she mentioned that she used to feel the same pressure to collaborate, but sometimes people just work better in their own way. I agreed and realized that I shouldn't have pressed the issue and that everyone has their own style of working.

However, as the event date approached, it became clear that both were struggling to keep up with their commitments. Sarah had family obligations that took precedence, and Mike ended up having to work extra hours at his job.

I tried to be understanding and reassured them that it was okay if they couldn’t contribute as much as we initially planned.

Mike felt bad too and apologized for not being able to take on the music anymore. I realized that my comment had made them feel worse about the situation, and that was never my intention. 

I ended up apologizing for my frustration and thanking them for any help they could provide, even if it was minimal. We all had a good talk and decided to focus on what we could each contribute without the pressure of expectations.

One of my friends, Sarah, has a habit of being very vocal about her dietary preferences.

I had also prepared a few vegan options for her, but when she arrived, she immediately expressed her disappointment that I hadn’t made the entire meal vegan-friendly.

I felt bad that she was upset, but I also thought it was unreasonable for her to expect me to completely change my plans for one person's dietary restrictions, especially since I had made an effort to accommodate her.

I also have a small group of friends who are in similar creative fields, and we often share our work and give each other feedback.

A couple of months ago, one of my friends, Sarah, reached out to me. She had been working on a project for a charity event and needed some help with the promotional materials. She is an aspiring photographer and had put together some amazing photos but wasn’t sure how to present them effectively. I was more than happy to lend a hand, and we agreed to meet up and brainstorm together.

When we got together, we had a great time bouncing ideas off each other. I helped her with the layout and typography, and she was thrilled with the concepts we came up with. However, as we worked, I noticed that she was becoming increasingly anxious about the timeline. The event was only a week away, and she was worried that she wouldn’t have everything ready in time.

I offered to stay late and help her finish up the designs. We ended up working for several hours, and by the end of the night, we had created some beautiful materials for the event. Sarah was really grateful and mentioned how much she appreciated my help.

A few days later, she invited me to the charity event. I was excited to see the final product and support her work. When I arrived, I noticed that some of my designs were credited, but my name was misspelled on the materials. I didn’t think much of it at first, but later in the evening, I overheard some guests discussing the promotional materials, and they were praising Sarah for her “incredible design work.”

Feeling a little awkward, I approached Sarah and mentioned my name being misspelled. She apologized and said she would fix it. I could tell she was overwhelmed, and I didn’t want to add to her stress, so I brushed it off and told her it wasn’t a big deal.

Throughout the evening, I realized that Sarah was receiving a lot of praise for the designs, and while I was happy for her, I couldn’t help but feel a little overshadowed.

My mom made sure to prepare some vegetarian dishes for me, but I noticed that the main focus of the barbecue was, of course, the meat. As the day went on, I enjoyed my food and chatted with everyone, but I could tell some family members were a bit annoyed that I wasn’t eating any of the grilled steaks and sausages. My cousin, who is a big meat lover, teased me about it, saying that I was missing out on the “best part” of the barbecue. I laughed it off, but I could sense some judgment behind the jokes.

At one point, my aunt brought up an old family story where she joked that I used to love hot dogs as a kid, and she said something like, “It’s a shame you can’t enjoy them anymore.” I replied that while I appreciated the nostalgic memory, I just felt better sticking to my vegetarian diet for personal and health reasons. This led to a bit more ribbing from my cousin and some side comments from others about how “extreme” my choice was.

Towards the end of the barbecue, I overheard my cousin saying to someone, “It’s just food; she should loosen up a bit.” While I understand he was trying to be light-hearted, it felt dismissive of my choices. I didn’t want to make a scene, so I just kept eating my veggie burger and tried to enjoy the day.

While I was typing away, I noticed a family sitting at the next table. They had a little toddler who was being quite rambunctious, running around and giggling. It was actually quite amusing, and I couldn't help but smile at their antics.

At one point, the toddler accidentally knocked over a cup of water that spilled onto their table and a bit onto mine too.

After that, I noticed the parents whispering to each other and glancing at me. I could sense they were a bit uncomfortable, so I decided to pack up and leave a little earlier than planned to avoid any awkwardness. As I was leaving, I waved goodbye to them and the toddler, who waved back excitedly.

No one is the Asshole,"For my birthday this year, I (F26) decided to throw a small dinner party with some close friends. I sent out the invites a few weeks in advance, and everyone was excited to celebrate together. One of my friends, Sarah (F25), mentioned she was going to be out of town for a family event but said she might be back in time for the dinner. I told her it would be great if she could make it, but I understood if she couldn't.

The day of the party arrived, and I had everything set up nicely with food, drinks, and decorations. As the evening went on, my friends started arriving, and we were all having a great time. Just as we were about to sit down for dinner, Sarah showed up! She had managed to return earlier than expected, and everyone was thrilled to see her.

However, I noticed that she seemed a bit upset. Throughout the dinner, she didn’t engage much with the group and spent a lot of time on her phone. After dinner, I approached her to see if everything was okay. She told me she felt really bad for coming back just for my party because she had told her family she would be there for an important event. I reassured her that I was happy she could join us, but she seemed torn about the situation.

Later that night, when everyone was leaving, Sarah apologized to me for not being fully present and expressed her guilt about the family event. I told her that I appreciated her being there and that she shouldn’t feel guilty for wanting to celebrate with friends. I also suggested that we could hang out one-on-one soon so she could share more about her family event.

Now I’m feeling a bit conflicted. I don’t want her to feel bad about coming to my party, but I also want her to know that her family is important too. AITA for wanting to celebrate my birthday with my friends, even if it meant Sarah felt guilty about missing her family event?",485,1824,0.66,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_37449,2020-05-05 00:00:00,NAH,1854,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"A few months ago, my neighbor lost her elderly dog, who had been with her for over a decade. It was a tough time, and I tried to be supportive by checking in on her and offering to help with anything she needed. After a few weeks, she decided to adopt a new puppy. Initially, she was overjoyed, and we talked a lot about the puppy’s antics and how she was adjusting to life with the new dog.

However, I started to notice that she was trying to introduce her new puppy to everyone in the neighborhood, and while I understood the excitement, it felt a bit overwhelming. She would show up at my door multiple times a week with the puppy, wanting to share every little update and ask for playdates. It was sweet but also a lot, especially since I was dealing with my own busy schedule.

One day, I gently mentioned that while I loved hearing about her puppy, I was feeling a bit overwhelmed with my own commitments and needed some space. She took it hard and seemed hurt, saying I was being unsupportive. I didn’t mean to upset her, but I also felt it was important to express my boundaries.

Now, there’s this awkward tension between us. I feel bad because I understand her excitement and grief, but I also need to prioritize my own mental space. Am I the Asshole for expressing my need for space when she’s just trying to share her joy?",350,2513,0.76,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_54225,2018-01-06 00:00:00,NAH,1335,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My sister, Clara, and I have always been close, but we’ve had our share of disagreements, especially about parenting. We both have young kids, and she has been really excited about her son, Jake, starting preschool. I decided to sign my daughter, Lily, up for the same preschool, mainly because I thought it would be fun for them to be together.

The preschool has a strict policy on class sizes and age groups, and due to a last-minute change, they told me there would be a separate class for the younger kids. I signed Lily up for the younger class without realizing it might upset Clara. I thought they’d still have time to play together during pick-up and drop-off.

When I told Clara about it, she seemed disappointed but didn’t say much. However, as the start date approached, I noticed she was posting a lot about how excited Jake was for his class and how much she hoped he would have a friend in Lily. I started feeling guilty and wondered if I should have pushed for them to be in the same class.

On the first day of school, I dropped Lily off, and Clara was there with Jake. She immediately asked if I could talk to the teachers and see if they could switch Lily to Jake’s class. I was hesitant because I knew they would both benefit from having separate experiences, but I could see how much she wanted them to be together.

After some back and forth, I decided to let it go and asked the teachers if they could move Lily to Jake's class. They agreed, and I felt relieved to see Clara’s face light up when I told her. 

However, as the weeks went by, I noticed that Jake was getting quite clingy to Lily, and Lily was starting to struggle a bit. She would cry when I dropped her off, saying she wanted to play alone sometimes. I felt it was best for them to be in separate classes after all, so I approached the teachers again and asked if Lily could switch back to her original class.

I told Clara about my decision, and she was hurt, saying it felt like I was taking away their chance to be together. I explained my concerns, and she admitted that Jake had been struggling too. We ended up having a long conversation about balancing friendships and independence for the kids.

In the end, I switched Lily back to her original class, and Jake remained in his. I think it was a good decision for both kids. I still feel a bit guilty about the way things played out, but I believe we’re all in a better place now.

No one is the Asshole,"My friend and I were invited to a wedding where we both knew the bride but not really the groom. We were excited to celebrate, and we had planned our outfits and everything. On the day of the wedding, we arrived early to help with some last-minute decorations as a favor to the bride.

As the ceremony began, my friend and I sat together, enjoying the beautiful setting. However, during the vows, my friend suddenly realized she had forgotten to silence her phone and panicked. She quickly pulled it out and, in her haste, accidentally dropped it. It made a loud clatter as it hit the floor, catching everyone's attention, including the couple at the altar. My friend turned bright red and tried to hide under her dress. 

After the vows, I found it hard to concentrate because I was worried about my friend's embarrassment. I leaned over and whispered some comforting words, but she was still mortified. During the reception, she seemed withdrawn and didn't want to partake in the dancing or festivities. Seeing her like this made me feel bad, so I took her aside and told her that everyone makes mistakes and that the couple probably found it humorous in hindsight.

I thought I was helping, but she snapped at me, saying I was downplaying her embarrassment. I was just trying to support her, but in the heat of the moment, I realized that my attempt to help made things worse. 

We ended up having a small argument about it, but we both calmed down when we shared some drinks and laughed about our awkwardness. We left the wedding feeling better, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I might have been insensitive to her feelings at first.

She was eager to learn, but I noticed that she was struggling with some basic procedures. I took the time to go over everything with her, and I was patient, understanding that she was new and nervous.

One day, during a particularly hectic shift, Sarah made a critical mistake while administering medication to a patient. Thankfully, I caught it in time before any harm was done. It was a serious issue, and I had to report it to my supervisor. After discussing the incident with my supervisor, we agreed that Sarah needed additional training and a chance to step back from medication responsibilities until she felt more comfortable.

When I went to talk to Sarah about what happened, she became very defensive and upset. She felt embarrassed and blamed the situation on the overwhelming pace of the unit, saying she didn’t receive enough support. I tried to explain that everyone makes mistakes and that it was part of the learning process, but she didn’t seem to want to hear it. 

Later, I overheard her talking to another nurse, expressing her frustration about me being too hard on her and that I didn’t understand how stressful it was to be new. I felt bad, as I genuinely wanted to support her, but I also knew I had to prioritize patient safety.

Basically, we have a monthly game night where we all gather to play board games and just hang out. It’s something we’ve been doing for a couple of years now, and I always look forward to it.

A few weeks ago, one of my friends, let’s call him Mark, suggested that we should play a new game he recently bought. He was super excited about it, and I could tell he had invested a lot of time in learning the rules. However, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with work lately and just wanted to play something simpler that we could all enjoy without too much setup or rule explanations. 

I voiced my concerns when we were discussing what to play, and I suggested we stick with a classic game that everyone knows. I thought it would be easier for everyone, especially for those who might not be as familiar with Mark’s new game. Mark then got a bit defensive and said I was being dismissive of his interests. The rest of the group seemed split; some agreed with me that a simpler game would be better, while others sided with Mark.

In the end, we played Mark’s game, and while it was fun, I felt bad that I may have hurt his feelings with my suggestion. I also feel like I may have come off as controlling or dismissive of his excitement. I just wanted everyone to have a good time without the stress of learning a new game.

After the night ended, I reached out to Mark to apologize if I came off as insensitive, and he said he understood where I was coming from but still felt a little disappointed. I genuinely appreciate his enthusiasm and want to support him, but I also want to make sure everyone is having fun.

So, am I the asshole for wanting to stick with something familiar instead of trying out a new game that one of my friends is excited about? Should I have just gone along with it?

Last week, I organized a small get-together at my place with a few mutual friends, hoping it would help lift his spirits. I told him about it and encouraged him to come, but he said he was feeling overwhelmed and needed to stay in.

I expressed my concerns to him privately, suggesting that while his cause is important, we might need to find a better balance between discussing the non-profit and just enjoying each other’s company. I mentioned that maybe we could set aside specific times to brainstorm and work on the non-profit, rather than making it a central focus every time we get together.

No one is the Asshole,"First post, and I’m looking for some clarity on whether I'm the asshole in this situation.

A little backstory:

I (26F) have a close friend, Sarah (27F), who recently got engaged. I was so excited for her and immediately started brainstorming ideas for her bachelorette party. Sarah is very outgoing and loves big social gatherings, while I tend to be a bit more introverted and prefer smaller, more intimate settings.

After discussing it with a few mutual friends, we decided on a weekend getaway to a cabin in the woods with a few close friends. I thought it would be a great way for everyone to relax and bond. I gave Sarah several options, including outdoor activities, game nights, and even a spa day. She seemed really excited about the cabin idea and we all started planning.

As the date approached, Sarah mentioned she was also thinking about inviting a larger group of her more party-oriented friends. I was a bit hesitant, as I know how overwhelming large crowds can be for me, but I didn't want to dampen her excitement. I figured I could handle it and just take some breaks if I needed to.

When we arrived at the cabin, it quickly turned into a much bigger gathering than I anticipated. Sarah invited a total of 20 people, and it felt chaotic almost immediately. The loud music, the drinking games, and the constant mingling really began to overwhelm me. I felt out of place and stressed, especially when people started to push for more drinking and partying.

I tried to be supportive and join in, but I ended up retreating to a quiet corner of the cabin several times to collect my thoughts. After a while, Sarah noticed I was missing and came to check on me. I expressed my discomfort and how I was feeling overwhelmed by the crowd. She was understanding but told me that she really wanted this to be a fun event for everyone and urged me to try to relax and enjoy it since it was her special weekend.

Feeling torn between wanting to support my friend and my own needs, I ultimately decided to leave early. Sarah was a bit disappointed, saying she wished I could have stayed longer, but she understood that not everyone is comfortable in big social situations. I thought I was doing the right thing by prioritizing my mental health, but now I’m second-guessing if I should have just tried harder to fit in.

No one is the Asshole,"This is a bit of a light-hearted situation, but it’s left me feeling a little confused about whether I handled it right or not. I'm hoping to get some perspective on this.

So, here’s what happened:

I was at a local coffee shop on a Saturday morning, enjoying a book and a cup of my favorite brew. It was a bit crowded, with people chatting and working on their laptops. At one point, I noticed a little girl, maybe around six or seven years old, sitting at a nearby table with her dad. She seemed to be getting a bit restless and was looking around at all the pastries on display.

After a few minutes, I saw the dad get up to order more coffee, leaving her sitting alone. She kept glancing at the pastries, and I caught her eye. I smiled at her, and she smiled back. In that moment, I had an idea. I leaned over and said, “Hey, if you’re really hungry and want a treat, I can buy you a pastry. What do you think?”

The girl looked surprised but excited. She whispered something to her dad, who had just returned to the table and overheard our conversation. His expression went from curiosity to hesitation, and he smiled politely but said, “Oh, that’s very nice of you, but I think we’re okay.” 

I felt a bit awkward at that point, and I quickly backtracked, saying something like, “Oh, it’s no problem! I just thought she might like one!”

The dad thanked me again and said they’d already picked out some pastries to share. I felt a little embarrassed, but I didn’t want to seem pushy, so I just nodded and went back to my book.

Looking back, I’m wondering if it was weird for me to offer to buy a pastry for a stranger’s kid. I meant it as a kind gesture, but I can see how it might have made the dad uncomfortable. I really just wanted to brighten her day, and I didn’t mean to overstep any boundaries.

So, Reddit, AITA for offering to buy a pastry for a little girl when her dad was right there? I’m genuinely unsure if I misread the situation or if I was just being friendly.",780,1112,0.91,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_44583,2020-07-31 00:00:00,NAH,1986,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I live with my roommate, and we get along quite well. However, there's a recurring issue with her keeping the living room really cluttered. She has a busy schedule and often doesn't have time to clean up after herself, which I completely understand. I know she's juggling a lot with work and school.

The problem is that she tends to leave her textbooks, notes, and snacks all over the place. I’ve tried to help her by encouraging her to set aside time to tidy up, but I think the stress of her responsibilities makes it difficult for her to focus on cleaning. As a result, I end up spending a few hours each week reorganizing our shared space and putting things away just to maintain a sense of order in the apartment.

I’ve brought it up to her a couple of times, suggesting we could create a cleaning schedule together to make it easier for both of us, but she often brushes it off, saying she’ll get to it later. I’ve started just organizing the space myself and putting her things in neat piles, hoping this will motivate her to keep it clean. She’s noticed and seems grateful, but I can tell it frustrates her at times since she feels bad about not keeping up.

I'm just trying to help out, but I’m wondering if I’m overstepping by taking the initiative to clean up without her input. AITA?",277,972,0.83,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_90003,2019-05-24 00:00:00,NAH,1296,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been living together for about a year now, and we both have very different lifestyles. They are more introverted and enjoy quiet nights in, while I love going out with friends and being social. This has led to some tension between us, especially when I want to host gatherings at our place.

One weekend, I decided to throw a small get-together with a few friends. I made sure to invite only a few people to keep it manageable and respectful of my partner’s need for a quiet space. I told my partner about the plan in advance, and they seemed okay with it, even if they preferred to stay in the bedroom during the gathering.

As the night went on, more people arrived than I had initially planned, and the noise level increased. My partner eventually came out of the bedroom looking visibly upset. They expressed that they felt overwhelmed by the noise and the number of people, even though I thought I was being considerate by keeping it small.

I immediately apologized and offered to help them find a more comfortable spot in the apartment, but they were still frustrated. We had a conversation later that night about how to better balance our lifestyles and ensure that we both feel at home in our space, especially when it comes to hosting.

In the end, we agreed that I would give them more notice in the future about gatherings and would consider their comfort more seriously. We both felt a bit bad about how the situation unfolded, but we also recognized that it was a learning experience for both of us. I genuinely want to make our shared living space enjoyable for both of us, and I think we’re on the right path to understanding each other better.

Last week, my friend Jake, who is really into art but has never tried pottery, asked if he could join me. I was excited to share this experience with him. However, during the class, I noticed he was getting a bit frustrated with the techniques. He struggled to center the clay and got upset when his pieces didn’t turn out the way he envisioned. I tried to encourage him, reminding him that it takes time to get the hang of it, but he seemed to be having a hard time enjoying it.

After class, we went for coffee, and he mentioned that he felt like he was wasting his time and that maybe this wasn't for him. I empathized with him but also expressed my hope that he would give it a few more tries before deciding to give up. He appreciated my honesty but also felt a bit embarrassed that his first experience wasn’t great.

After asking around, it seems that others in the team were split on whether it was okay to offer help or if it added more pressure to Jenna.

I felt bad for potentially making her uncomfortable, so I decided to have an open conversation with her about it. I told her that I completely respect her approach and that if she ever needed assistance, I would be more than happy to pitch in. Jenna appreciated my honesty, and we ended up discussing our work styles and how we could better support each other without stepping on toes.

Recently, we had a new hire, Jake (28m), who has been struggling to adapt to the office culture. He’s really talented but tends to be a bit too direct in his communication, which has made some team members uncomfortable.

A few weeks ago, during a team meeting, he made a comment about one of my project ideas that felt dismissive, saying it was “too boring” without providing any constructive feedback. I felt a bit blindsided and, to be honest, hurt by his comments in front of everyone. After the meeting, I approached him and explained how his words made me feel. I hoped to encourage him to communicate more thoughtfully since we’re all working towards the same goals.

Jake apologized and said he didn’t intend to hurt my feelings; he just thought he was being straightforward. We had a good conversation, and I could sense that he genuinely wanted to improve. Since then, I’ve noticed that he’s been trying to adjust his communication style, but the other team members have started to mock him a bit for being “too soft” now.

I’m caught in the middle because I appreciate his efforts to change, but I don’t want him to feel alienated either. I mentioned to my team that we should be supportive of each other and respect everyone’s way of contributing, but they brushed it off as me being too sensitive.

Normally, we hang out every weekend, but lately, she’s been canceling on me a lot or just not responding to my texts.

Last weekend, I decided to invite her to a small gathering at my place with a few mutual friends, hoping it might lift her spirits. I sent her a text a couple of days in advance, but she didn't respond. I figured she was busy, so I didn’t push it. On the day of the gathering, I saw on social media that she was out at a café with some other friends. I felt somewhat hurt because I had invited her and she didn’t even mention it. 

Later that night, I texted her, trying to keep it light, asking if she’d seen what we were up to. I didn’t mean to make her feel guilty, but she texted back saying she felt bad for not coming but just wasn’t ready to socialize with that group of friends yet. I told her it was okay and that I understood, but I also mentioned that it hurt a little to see her out when I had invited her.

Now I feel conflicted because I don’t want to pressure her, but at the same time, I wish she could have been honest about not wanting to hang out, rather than leaving me in the dark. I care about her and just want to support her, but I also don’t want to keep getting hurt when she chooses to hang out with others instead.

No one is the Asshole,"I’m feeling really conflicted and would appreciate some outside perspective on my situation. 

Recently, my friend and I went on a weekend trip to a nearby city for a music festival. We had been looking forward to this for months, and I had even bought a couple of new outfits for the occasion. The first night, we had an absolute blast, dancing and enjoying the performances.

However, the second day, my friend got a text from her ex-boyfriend, who she had a pretty tumultuous relationship with. He wanted to meet up and talk things over. I could see she was torn; part of her wanted to go, but she was also aware that we had come for the festival. I tried to encourage her to enjoy the event, but ultimately, I didn’t want to pressure her either way.

After some hesitation, she decided to go meet him for what she said would be just an hour. I felt a little abandoned since I was really looking forward to experiencing the festival together, but I didn’t want to make her feel guilty for wanting to sort things out with him. 

While she was gone, I did my best to enjoy the music and hang out with other festival-goers, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of disappointment and frustration. When my friend returned a couple of hours later, she seemed happier and lighter, but I couldn’t help but feel a bit sour about the whole situation. 

I didn’t vent my frustrations at her; instead, I just smiled and pretended like everything was fine. But inside, I was bothered that she chose to prioritize her ex over our time together. The rest of the night, I tried my best to enjoy myself, but I still felt a bit resentful.

My partner had asked me to keep the dogs off the couch and to not let them beg at the table. I understood the request but decided to let them have a little fun since our friends were pet lovers and it was a relaxed atmosphere. I let the dogs jump up on the couch for a bit and gave them some scraps from our dinner.

My partner was visibly upset and confronted me about not following the rules. I tried to explain that it was just a one-time thing and that our friends enjoyed the pets being involved. We ended up having a bit of a heated discussion in front of our friends, which I felt embarrassed about.

Afterwards, we both apologized for how we handled it. I understand my partner wants consistency for the pets, but I also think that sometimes it’s okay to let loose a bit and enjoy their company, especially in a social setting. It's just a difference in our approaches to pet ownership.

He enjoys action-packed blockbusters, while I lean more towards indie films and dramas. Out of nowhere, he suggested we have a movie marathon with a mix of both genres.

I thought it was a great idea and started making a list of indie films I wanted to share. He seemed excited until I mentioned a couple of titles that were a bit slower-paced. He then jokingly said, ""Ugh, I don’t want to fall asleep during your artsy stuff!"" I laughed it off, but it did sting a little since I really value those films. 

Rather than getting upset, I decided to suggest that we alternate between the genres—watch one of my picks, then one of his. He agreed, but I could tell he was still skeptical about my choices. During the marathon, I could see him struggling to stay engaged during my films, and I felt guilty for dragging him into something he wasn’t enjoying.

After the marathon, I brought it up, saying I hoped he had fun, but I felt bad if he didn't enjoy the slower movies. He admitted he appreciated the effort but was more into the fast-paced stuff. We had a good talk about our preferences and agreed to plan future marathons that catered to both our tastes.

I’m in a blended family situation and have been navigating the complexities of cooking for everyone involved. I have a teenage daughter, and my partner has a young son. My daughter loves to help out in the kitchen and often wants to prepare her favorite dishes, but I've noticed that her tastes are quite different from those of my partner's son, who has a few dietary restrictions due to allergies.

Recently, my daughter decided she wanted to make her famous ""loaded nachos"" for movie night. It's a dish she’s very proud of and loves to share. The problem is that it includes cheese, sour cream, and some spicy toppings, which aren’t suitable for my partner’s son due to his dairy allergy and sensitivity to spice.

Before we started cooking, I talked to my partner and suggested we could make a modified version for her son that excluded the dairy and spice, using safe alternatives. My daughter was initially disappointed because she wanted to share her exact recipe, but I explained that it was important to consider everyone's needs. Eventually, we came up with a plan: we would make a small batch of the original nachos for my daughter and a separate version for her son with all the necessary substitutions. 

On the night of the movie, we had both versions ready, and it ended up being a fun and collaborative experience in the kitchen. Everyone enjoyed their meals, and it felt great to see my daughter be flexible and inclusive.

I have a younger sister, Emma, who has always been passionate about art. Ever since she was a kid, she has spent countless hours drawing and painting. Over the years, her talent has blossomed, and she recently got accepted into a prestigious art summer camp that she had been dreaming about for years. The camp is quite expensive, and our parents were struggling to come up with the funds. 

I’m in college and work part-time to cover my expenses. After some discussions, I decided to take out a small loan to help cover the cost of Emma’s camp tuition. I really wanted her to have this opportunity, and I believed it would mean the world to her.

When I told Emma about the loan and that I’d be covering most of her camp costs, she was overjoyed, but it came with an unexpected reaction. Emma felt tremendous guilt over the money I was borrowing. She insisted that I shouldn’t be putting myself in a difficult financial situation for her sake. I tried to reassure her that it was my choice and that I wanted her to pursue her passion without the burden of financial worry.

However, as the camp neared, the pressure started to mount. Emma became increasingly anxious about the whole situation. She started to feel that she had to justify the money spent on her, worrying about whether she would live up to the expectations of the camp and make the investment worthwhile. 

A week before she was supposed to leave, she unexpectedly told me she had decided not to go. She felt it was unfair to put me in a position where I might struggle financially because of her decision. I was heartbroken. I felt like I had done all this for her, and now she wouldn’t even take the opportunity.

After some tearful conversations, I realized that Emma was torn between her desire to attend the camp and her guilt over the financial burden. I ultimately told her it was okay to go and that I would figure out the financial part later. I just wanted her to be happy and to pursue her dreams.

The trip was amazing! I had a blast with Karen's family, and they made me feel so welcome. However, when I got back, I noticed my mom seemed a bit off. I asked her about it, and she mentioned that she had been feeling stressed and lonely while I was away. She had been working long hours and missed having me around to talk to and spend time with.

I felt terrible for not realizing how much my absence affected her. I told her how much I appreciated her support and how I loved spending time with her, but I couldn't help feeling that I needed some time away to recharge and enjoy being a teenager. It led to a deeper conversation about how we balance our time and support each other. We both ended up realizing we need to communicate better about our feelings and schedules.

In the end, I think we both learned something valuable about our relationship.

No one is the Asshole,"A few months ago, my sister and her two kids moved in with me after her husband left her for someone else. She's been going through a tough time, and I wanted to support her as best as I could. I have a spare room, and we agreed that she would stay with me temporarily while she got back on her feet. 

Initially, she was able to contribute a little towards groceries and utilities, but as the weeks went on, she started struggling more. Her job as a server was inconsistent because of the pandemic, and she was also dealing with emotional stress. I completely understood that she was in a difficult situation, and I didn't want to add to her stress by pushing her for money.

However, as time went on, I started feeling overwhelmed. My home became increasingly chaotic with the kids running around, and I found it hard to have any personal space. I also noticed that my own mental health was suffering because I was constantly trying to help her manage the kids while also working from home.

I spoke with her about possibly looking for a more permanent solution, like finding a smaller apartment she could afford, but I didn’t want to sound unsupportive or like I was kicking her out. She seemed grateful for my help but I could tell she was also feeling the pressure of needing to find a way to support herself and the kids.

I decided to give her some time to figure things out, but I’m also starting to feel like I need to set a timeline. It’s a tough spot because I care about my sister and want her to succeed, but I also need to reclaim my space and mental well-being.

We've always had a close bond, but recently, she’s been going through a rough patch. She lost her job a couple of months ago, and it's been hard for her to find a new one. I wanted to help, so I invited her over for dinner to lift her spirits and just catch up.

I cooked her favorite meal and we had a great time reminiscing about old times. After dinner, we decided to play a game that we used to love in college. We were laughing and having a good time when, out of the blue, she started sharing some details about her job hunt. She mentioned how she applied to a position she really wanted but hadn’t heard back yet. In the moment, I got excited and suggested we could do a little mock interview to help her prepare, as I used to help with her resume and practice interviews back in the day.

She agreed, but I misread her mood. As I started asking her typical interview questions, I noticed she seemed more anxious than enthusiastic. I kept pushing through, thinking I was helping her, but she eventually stopped me and said she wasn’t in the right headspace for this right now. She appreciated the offer, but she just wanted to relax and have fun for the night.

I felt embarrassed and a little hurt. I thought I was being supportive, but I realized I might have overwhelmed her. I immediately apologized and we shifted gears back to fun, but the vibe had changed a bit. Later, she told me she appreciated my intentions but needed to focus on self-care rather than pressure.

No one is the Asshole,"I’d like to share a situation I recently experienced that has been bothering me, and I’m hoping for some perspective.

A bit of background: I've been friends with a group of five people since college. We’ve always supported each other through various ups and downs, and we try to meet up regularly. Recently, one of our friends, Sam, started a new job that requires him to work weekends, which has made it hard for him to join our regular get-togethers.

When we learned about his schedule, we decided to plan a special outing for the group on a Saturday that we knew he couldn’t make. It was a celebration for another friend’s promotion, and we thought it was important to still have the event even if Sam couldn’t be there. I was the one who proposed this date, and I didn't think it would be a big deal since we often have events that not everyone can attend.

After we had the outing, Sam reached out to express his disappointment about missing it. He said he felt left out and hurt that we chose a day when he couldn’t come, and he worried it meant we didn’t value his friendship as much. I was taken aback because my intention was never to exclude him; I genuinely thought it would be a fun way to celebrate together.

I apologized and explained my reasoning, and while I could see where he was coming from, I also felt like we had to keep moving forward with our lives and celebrate the things that matter, even if one person couldn’t join.

This year, my sister had a baby a few months ago and is still adjusting to motherhood. She expressed that she didn't feel comfortable having a large gathering at her home yet, which I totally understand. So, I offered to host the gathering at my place instead. My sister initially seemed really supportive of this, and we started planning together.

However, as the date approached, my sister began to voice concerns about how I was planning the event. She felt that since she was the one who had a baby this year, we should cater to her preferences, which included a quieter gathering and specific food options. I was taken aback because I had already made arrangements based on what I thought everyone would enjoy. 

In response, I suggested we could have a small, quieter area for her and her family and keep the rest of the gathering more lively for everyone else. This made her upset, and she accused me of not considering her needs as a new mother. I explained that I was trying to find a middle ground that would work for everyone, but in her frustration, she decided to cancel coming altogether.

Now, I feel conflicted. I wanted to be accommodating, but I also wanted to keep the gathering enjoyable for the rest of the family. I’m worried that I may have upset her more than I intended.

So, I (28M) have a close group of friends that I play board games with every week. Recently, we decided to have a theme night with snacks to match the game we were playing. I picked a fantasy-themed game, and I thought it would be fun to serve foods that fit the theme—like dragon-shaped cookies and ""magic potion"" drinks.

One of my friends, Sarah (27F), is gluten-free due to health reasons. I thought I had everything covered with the snacks, but I completely forgot to make gluten-free options for her until the day of the gathering. In a panic, I quickly made some gluten-free cookies, but they were not as elaborate as the others I had prepared.

When Sarah arrived, she was really understanding about my oversight, but I could tell she felt a bit left out when she saw everyone digging into the themed snacks. I tried to make it up by letting her know that I appreciated her being so understanding and that the gluten-free cookies were still tasty, but I could see that she was still a bit disappointed.

Afterward, I texted her to apologize and assured her that I would be more thoughtful next time about her dietary restrictions. She responded saying she appreciated the effort and that she knows I didn't mean to leave her out, but I still feel bad about it.

In hindsight, I should have been more considerate when planning the snacks.

No one is the Asshole,"After several years of living in our current neighborhood, my partner and I decided to host a block party to strengthen our sense of community. We thought it would be a great way for everyone to get to know each other better and create a more supportive environment. We sent out invitations to all our neighbors and planned activities like games for the kids, a potluck for food, and a few fun contests.

As the day approached, I noticed some tension building between me and my partner. They were really excited about the event and wanted it to be perfect, but I was feeling overwhelmed with work and other commitments. I tried to express my concerns, suggesting we simplify things and maybe keep the gathering smaller, but my partner was adamant about going ahead with the original plan. They were particularly attached to the idea of having a bounce house for the kids, which I thought was a little extravagant given our budget.

The day of the party arrived, and things didn’t go as smoothly as we had hoped. A couple of neighbors didn't show up, and the bounce house ended up being too much for our space. It was a bit chaotic, and I could sense my partner was disappointed. While we were cleaning up afterward, they expressed their frustration, and I ended up snapping at them, saying that we should have listened to each other more.

Looking back, I realize that we were both trying to do our best to create a welcoming atmosphere for the neighborhood, but the stress and my work commitments clouded my judgment. My partner genuinely wanted to foster connections, and I should have been more supportive instead of being critical. I apologized afterward, and we agreed that while the party didn't go perfectly, it was still a step in the right direction for our community.

In the end, I think we both learned a lot about communication and compromise, and we're planning to host another smaller get-together soon.

I have a family of my own now, and we tend to spend our holidays with my in-laws, which my sister sometimes resents.

This year, I organized a small birthday party for my daughter at our house and sent out invites to our family and friends. I assumed my sister would be busy since she hadn't mentioned her plans, and I didn’t think to include her on the invite list. I felt a bit guilty afterward, but I also thought it would be okay since we don't see each other much anyway.

A few days after the party, I received a message from her expressing that she felt hurt and excluded for not being invited. She mentioned how she would have loved to celebrate with us and felt like I was intentionally leaving her out. I explained it was an oversight, and I genuinely didn’t think she would want to come.

I immediately apologized, explaining that I was just trying to be supportive, but I understood how it could have come across as insensitive. 

We ended up having a good discussion about how sometimes humor can miss the mark, especially in a group setting where people don’t know each other well. I genuinely felt bad for her and appreciated her for bringing it up instead of letting it fester.

I went all out with snacks, drinks, and themed decorations for a game we were playing. Everyone seemed to have a great time, and I felt good about how the night went.

However, one of my friends, let's call him Mark, has a habit of being a bit too competitive. After we finished playing, he started making some comments about how I ""could have done better"" in terms of organization and how the game setup could have been improved. I could tell he was joking, but it felt a bit condescending, especially since I put a lot of effort into making the night enjoyable for everyone.

In the heat of the moment, I jokingly suggested that if he thought he could do it better, he should host next time. To my surprise, he took that seriously and said he would.

Last month, Jake started dating a girl named Emma who I’ve known for years. Emma is a sweet girl, but she has a tendency to get insecure and sometimes lashes out when she feels threatened.

Recently, during a family gathering, Jake and Emma got into a heated argument. Emma accused Jake of not being supportive enough and, in the heat of the moment, she said some really hurtful things to him. Jake was understandably upset and walked away, but Emma followed him, continuing to argue. I stepped in to try to mediate. I told Emma that while I understood she was feeling upset, it wasn’t right to take it out on Jake in front of the family. I suggested they take a break and talk things over privately.

After that, Emma seemed to cool down a bit, but she later confronted me about what I said. She accused me of taking Jake’s side and not understanding her feelings. I tried to explain that my intention was to help them both, but she felt like I was dismissing her emotions.

No one is the Asshole,"Hi all,

So, I recently went through a tough breakup. My ex and I had been together for over three years, and while it was mutual, the emotional fallout has been rough for both of us. We've been trying to navigate the aftermath as best as we can, and I thought we were on the same page about staying friends, but it’s been complicated.

About a week after the breakup, I decided to go out with some friends to distract myself. We ended up at this local bar where my ex was also hanging out with some other friends. I wasn’t planning on interacting with her but, of course, we ended up running into each other.

While it was a bit awkward, we exchanged pleasantries and I tried to keep things light. However, I could tell she was feeling down about everything too. So, in an attempt to ease the tension, I jokingly suggested we do a shot together like we used to when we were happy. She hesitated for a moment but eventually agreed.

We took the shot and ended up chatting for a little longer than intended. It felt nice to reconnect, and we even laughed a bit. But later, I found out from a mutual friend that my ex was upset about our interaction. She felt it was too soon for us to be that friendly, and she thought I was sending mixed signals.

I genuinely thought we were both just trying to cope in our own ways, and I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings. I reached out to her to apologize and clarify that I didn’t intend to lead her on or make her feel uncomfortable; I was just trying to lighten the mood.

Now I’m wondering if I was the asshole for suggesting we share that moment, or if she overreacted. We both have our own struggles, and I understand that emotions are high right now. AITA for trying to keep things light-hearted when I didn’t mean any harm?

Edit: Thank you for your insights, everyone. I see now that both of us are processing this breakup in our own ways, and it's a lot for both of us. I appreciate your understanding that I didn't mean to upset her. It’s okay for her to feel the way she does, and I’ll be more mindful in the future.",37,530,0.67,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_30997,2021-04-22 00:00:00,NAH,2064,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"A few weeks ago, my friend Jess invited me to her birthday dinner. She mentioned that it would be a nice dinner at a restaurant downtown. I was excited, but I also knew that things had been a bit tight for me financially lately. 

When I arrived at the restaurant, I realized that it was a more upscale place than I had anticipated. The menu was pretty pricey, and I started feeling anxious about what I should order. Jess noticed I was a bit off and asked if everything was okay. I hesitated, but then I told her I was worried about the cost, and I didn't want to be a burden.

Jess reassured me and said, ""Don’t worry about it! Just order what you want. It's my treat for my birthday!"" I felt relieved but also guilty. I didn't want her to feel obligated to cover my meal, especially since she had already organized the whole dinner and invited several friends.

As the dinner went on, I decided to order something moderate in price, but Jess insisted I should get whatever I wanted. I ended up getting a nice meal and dessert, and I had a great time celebrating with her and the others.

However, during the conversation, I brought up how I felt uncomfortable about her paying for me. I suggested that maybe we could split the bill instead, and she seemed a little upset that I didn’t just let her treat me. In the end, we agreed I would pay for my meal, and she would cover the rest.

TLDR: My friend invited me to her birthday dinner and insisted on treating me. I felt uncomfortable about her paying, but we compromised in the end. 

WIBTA if I hadn't suggested paying for my own meal?

No one is the Asshole,"I'm in a bit of a tough situation. My best friend and I have been inseparable since childhood, and we’ve always supported each other through thick and thin. Recently, he got engaged to his long-term girlfriend, and I couldn’t be happier for them. However, I’ve also been struggling with my own romantic life, and I’ve been secretly seeing someone who I really like but didn’t want to introduce to my friend just yet due to the timing of his engagement.

A few weeks ago, my friend and his fiancée decided to host an engagement party and invited a large group of people, including me. I thought it would be a great opportunity to celebrate their happiness. However, the week of the party, my girlfriend and I had a misunderstanding that led to a breakup. I was devastated and didn't want to show up to the party feeling down and out of sorts.

I decided to text my friend and let him know that I wouldn’t be able to make it to the engagement party because I was going through a tough time. He responded with disappointment but understood, saying that he hoped I’d feel better soon. However, a couple of days later, I received a text from his fiancée saying they were planning to have a small get-together with just close friends after the party and they would love for me to come.

Feeling like I might be able to handle the smaller gathering, I decided to show up. When I arrived, my friend was genuinely happy to see me, and we had some great conversations. However, during the evening, I realized that several guests were asking about my absence from the party, and I felt guilty for not being there to support my friend during such an important moment in his life.

My friend later pulled me aside and told me that he really wished I had been at the engagement party. He said it felt off without his closest friends there, and it made me feel bad for missing out. I tried to explain my situation, but I could tell he was still a bit hurt. 

So, Reddit, AITA for skipping my best friend’s engagement party because I was feeling down after a breakup, but still attending a smaller get-together later? I didn’t want to bring anyone down at what should be a joyful occasion, but I also feel guilty for not being there for him when it mattered.",396,1514,0.93,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_37256,2020-07-27 00:00:00,NAH,2242,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I'm a 32F and I’ve been best friends with Sarah, 31F, for over a decade. We’ve been through everything together, from college to heartbreaks to job changes. Sarah has always struggled with her self-esteem, particularly regarding her appearance. She’s beautiful in my eyes, but she sees herself as less than that.

Recently, Sarah decided to undergo a significant lifestyle change. She started a strict diet and workout regimen, and she was really excited about it. I supported her fully and even joined her for workouts to help keep her motivated. However, as the weeks went by, she became increasingly fixated on her weight and appearance. 

One day, while we were out shopping, Sarah tried on a dress she loved but was upset because it didn’t fit her the way she wanted. She started to tear up, and I tried to reassure her. I told her that her worth is not defined by her dress size and that she looked amazing no matter what. I thought I was being supportive, but Sarah got upset with me. She felt like I was minimizing her feelings and that I didn’t understand how hard she was working to change her body.

After that, she stopped talking to me as much, and I felt terrible. I wanted to be supportive, but I also didn’t want to make her feel like I wasn’t taking her seriously. I reached out to her a few times to apologize and to let her know I was there for her, but she seemed distant.

Last week, I invited her to a small gathering at my place with a few friends, hoping it would lighten her mood. She reluctantly came, but when someone complimented her on her outfit, she brushed it off angrily and left early. I felt like I had crossed some line by being there for her while she was struggling.

I just want to know if I did something wrong or if I should have acted differently. I care about her a lot, and I want to help her through this, but I also don’t want to push her away.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I (28M) recently attended a family gathering where my cousin (25F) was also present. We’ve always had a playful relationship and often joke around. During this gathering, we started teasing each other about our cooking skills, and it escalated into a light-hearted competition to see who could make the better dish for the family dinner.

As the day went on, I decided to take it a step further and challenged her to a cook-off, suggesting that we each make our signature dishes and have the family judge which one was better. Everyone was excited about it, and we both went to work in the kitchen, with plenty of laughter and friendly banter.

However, in the heat of the moment, I may have gone too far with my teasing. I jokingly said something like, “No one’s going to want to eat your mushy pasta when they can have my gourmet dish!” I thought it was all in good fun, but I noticed that she seemed to take it to heart. After a while, she got quiet and started focusing more on her cooking than on the teasing.

When dinner time came, both dishes were served, and the family did a blind taste test. In the end, my dish won by a narrow margin, and I celebrated with a bit of playful boasting. But as the night progressed, I noticed my cousin wasn’t really joining in on the fun. Later, she pulled me aside and told me that my comments had hurt her feelings, and she felt embarrassed. I immediately felt bad and apologized, explaining that I never meant to upset her and that I thought we were just having fun.

Now I’m wondering if I crossed a line with my jokes and whether I should have been more mindful of her feelings. I genuinely didn’t mean any harm, and it was all supposed to be playful.

No one is the Asshole,"About six months ago, I started a small online business selling handmade crafts. It was something I had always wanted to do, but I never had the time or resources until I was laid off from my job. Thankfully, I have a supportive partner who encouraged me to pursue my passion. 

I started small, working from home and gradually building my inventory. I posted my creations on social media, and to my surprise, I began receiving orders. My family and friends were really supportive and helped spread the word. I was able to turn my hobby into a little side income, which was a huge boost for me.

One evening, I was chatting with my sister, who is currently pursuing a degree and also working part-time. She expressed to me that she was struggling financially and was feeling overwhelmed by her expenses. I felt bad for her, so I offered to give her a discount on some of my crafts if she wanted to buy something for herself. I thought it would help her out a bit and also promote my business.

However, she declined my offer, saying that it felt wrong to take money from family, even if it was a discount. I assured her that it was just a business decision and that I wanted to help her, but she felt uncomfortable. The conversation turned a bit awkward, and she ended up saying I was being inconsiderate for trying to profit off her struggles.

Afterwards, I felt really conflicted. I was just trying to help, and I thought it was a fair offer. I didn’t want her to feel pressured or uncomfortable about it. I talked to my partner about it, and they suggested that maybe I should have just offered to give her something for free instead, but I didn’t want to impose or make her feel like I was pitying her.

No one is the Asshole,"Using a burner account for privacy reasons. My partner and I have been together for about four years, and we recently decided to adopt a dog together. We both love dogs and have talked about it for a while, so it seemed like a natural step for us.

After researching different breeds, we settled on a rescue dog because we wanted to give a home to a pup in need. We found a lovely mixed breed at a local shelter, and after a few visits, we decided to bring her home. We agreed that I would take on most of the responsibility for training and daily walks, while my partner would handle the feeding and vet visits.

However, once we brought the dog home, I quickly realized that my partner wasn't as invested in the training as I had expected. I would spend hours working with the dog on basic commands and socialization, while my partner often would just sit on the couch and scroll through their phone during our training sessions. This started to frustrate me because I felt like I was doing all the heavy lifting.

One evening, I brought it up gently, mentioning that I felt overwhelmed and could use some more support. My partner was taken aback and said they were doing their part by feeding the dog and taking her to the vet, but they didn't think they needed to be involved in the training. They also pointed out that they weren't as comfortable training dogs and didn't want to mess anything up.

We ended up having a long conversation about our expectations and how we could better share responsibilities. We came to an agreement that we would attend a training class together and that I would be more patient with my partner as they got accustomed to training techniques. I realized that my partner’s reluctance was more about comfort and confidence than a lack of care.

So, I’m wondering, AITA for feeling frustrated that my partner wasn’t more involved in training our new dog, or are we both just trying to figure things out together?",873,727,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_20450,2021-03-24 00:00:00,NAH,1947,AITA

I didn’t mean to, but I ended up mentioning to her that the judges might favor more advanced techniques and that she should maybe focus on something simpler. I thought I was just helping her manage her expectations, but she got really upset and said I was being mean. My parents overheard us and told me that I should support her fully, regardless of the competition.

I felt conflicted because I wanted her to understand that it’s okay to lose and that competitions can be tough. I didn’t want her to be crushed if she didn’t win.

One issue that came up was that my partner preferred a minimalist lifestyle, while I tend to be a bit of a collector. I have various items from my hobbies, like books, art supplies, and some sentimental things from my childhood. My partner expressed that he felt overwhelmed by the amount of stuff I had and suggested that I should downsize to create a more open and inviting space.

I understood where he was coming from, but I also felt that my possessions are part of who I am and provide comfort and joy. As a compromise, I proposed that we designate a specific area in the apartment for my items that wouldn't interfere with his minimalist vibe. He agreed, but later he seemed to second-guess that decision and suggested I should just get rid of more things.

This led to some tension, and I found myself feeling defensive about my belongings. I expressed to him that it felt like he was trying to erase aspects of my identity and that I needed him to appreciate my things rather than dismiss them. He apologized and clarified that he didn't want to erase anything but was just trying to create a living space that felt comfortable for both of us.

After some back and forth, we decided to sit down and go through my collection together, really discussing what items were important to keep, what could be stored, and what might be okay to let go of. It ended up being a bonding experience where we could talk about our preferences and values. We both acknowledged that we have different approaches to living but that it’s possible to respect each other's styles.

Sarah suggested that we all chip in for the dessert, which made sense to me since we were all having a great time together.

When the dessert arrived, it looked amazing, and we all enjoyed it. However, after the dinner, I noticed that Sarah seemed a bit withdrawn.

She's not on a special diet or anything, but she has a really strong dislike for certain textures. She can only eat foods that are soft and smooth, which means she avoids anything crunchy or chewy. This has led to some interesting (and sometimes awkward) moments at our gatherings. 

When I asked everyone to bring snacks, Sarah brought a giant bowl of mashed potatoes and some soft cookies. While I appreciate her effort, most of the group was excited about chips, pizza, and other snacks that we usually enjoy. During the game, she kept making comments about how she could never understand why people liked crunchy snacks, and it made some of my other friends uncomfortable. 

At one point, she even suggested that we should all just eat mashed potatoes instead of pizza because ""it's so much better for you."" I could tell my friends were trying to be polite, but it was clear they weren't enthusiastic about her suggestion. After a while, the conversation shifted to other topics, but the food comments kept creeping back in.

I ended up feeling frustrated because I wanted everyone to have a good time without any food-related tension. I considered talking to her about it but didn't want to hurt her feelings, as I know she has her preferences and they come from a genuine place.

I agreed to help, but I was also juggling my own work commitments, so I was only able to dedicate a few hours here and there.

Jake replied saying he was sorry if it felt too much and that he appreciated my help with the decorations.

Later, a mutual friend told me that Jake was disappointed I left early. He thought we were having a great time together and didn't realize I was feeling uncomfortable. I felt bad because I didn’t mean to upset him, and I just wanted to be honest about how I felt.

No one is the Asshole,"First time poster, long time reader.

So, I (30F) recently moved to a new city for work and decided to join a local book club to meet people. I love reading and thought it would be a great way to connect with others. The group is small, about six of us, and we meet once a week at a café.

During one of our meetings, we were discussing the book of the month, and one of the members, Sarah (28F), shared her thoughts about a character that she saw as a negative representation of a specific culture. While I understood her perspective, I felt that the character was more complex and didn’t necessarily fit into the category she described.

I gently disagreed with her, explaining my viewpoint and how I thought the character’s experiences bridged different backgrounds. I thought it was a healthy discussion, and everyone else seemed engaged. However, afterwards, I noticed that Sarah seemed upset and didn’t contribute much more to the conversation. 

A few days later, she sent a group message expressing that she felt my disagreement was dismissive of her feelings and that it made her uncomfortable. I immediately apologized and tried to explain that my intention was never to invalidate her perspective, but rather to share my own, hoping to encourage a rich discussion. 

Some members of the group chimed in, suggesting that we should all be respectful of differing viewpoints, but others felt that I should have just let her have her opinion without pushing back.

Now, I’m wondering if I overstepped by disagreeing with her. I genuinely wanted to have an open conversation about the book and different interpretations. 

AITA for sharing my opinion during a book discussion, or did I cross a line by disagreeing with Sarah?",638,537,0.72,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_62016,2023-06-28 00:00:00,NAH,1731,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I recently hosted a small dinner party at my place and invited a few close friends. One of my friends, Jamie, is a single parent and has a pretty hectic schedule, so I totally understand if she couldn't make it. As I was finalizing the details, I noticed that Jamie's daughter, Mia, had a dance recital on the same night. I thought that was a bummer, but I didn’t realize Jamie had planned to come until she mentioned it in passing.

When I sent out the invitations, I included a note mentioning that kids were welcome, thinking that it would be nice if she could bring Mia along. Jamie thanked me for the invite but then expressed her concern about bringing Mia because she felt it might be more of an adult gathering and wasn’t sure if it would be appropriate for her daughter.

I completely understood her perspective. I told her that it was totally fine if she wanted to attend alone and that I wouldn’t be offended if she felt it wouldn't be a good environment for Mia. Jamie ultimately decided to stay home and attend the recital instead, which I fully supported.

In the end, we both felt a bit disappointed that she couldn’t come, but I appreciated her honesty about the situation. There were no hard feelings, and we both agreed to catch up soon.

No one is the Asshole,"I (28F) have a younger brother (24M) who has always been a bit of a free spirit. He’s a talented artist but has struggled to find stable work since graduating college. Recently, he moved in with his girlfriend, and they’ve been living together for about six months. 

Over the past few months, I’ve noticed that he seems more stressed than usual, and when I asked him what was going on, he confessed that he feels lost and is unsure about his future. He mentioned that he’s been having trouble keeping up with rent, and his girlfriend has taken on most of the financial burden. I could tell he was embarrassed and frustrated.

Wanting to help, I offered to let him stay with me for a few months to help him get back on his feet—no rent, just focus on finding a job and creating art. He was really grateful for my offer, and we both felt it could be a good solution.

However, a few weeks later, he told me he wanted to move back in with his girlfriend. He felt guilty for putting too much pressure on her and wanted to support her by splitting expenses. I understood his desire to take responsibility, but I was worried it was too soon for him. I gently expressed my concerns and suggested he take a little more time to sort things out before moving back.

He got defensive and said I was undermining his ability to support himself and that I didn’t understand his situation. I was taken aback and tried to explain that I only wanted the best for him, but he insisted that he needed to make his own decisions.

After a tense conversation, I realized that he was really just trying to assert his independence. I told him that I would always support him, no matter what he chose, but that the door was still open if he needed a safety net.

Now, I’m left wondering if I overstepped by suggesting he stay with me longer when he really wanted to go back to his girlfriend. My friends have mixed opinions, with some saying I should have let him do what he felt was best, while others think I was right to worry about his instability.

While I was happy for her, I started to notice that she was spending a lot of time at his place, sometimes not coming home for a couple of days. This wouldn’t have been an issue if she communicated where she was, but she often wouldn’t tell our dad or me about her plans. 

I raised my concerns with her, explaining that our dad worries when he doesn’t hear from her, especially given the stress he’s under right now. I told her it would be nice if she could just drop us a quick message to let us know she’s safe and where she’ll be. She got defensive and accused me of trying to control her life, saying I was being nosy and that I should trust her to take care of herself.

I understood where she was coming from, but I felt that it was just common courtesy to keep each other in the loop, especially when we’re all living together. Our dad also expressed his worry about not knowing if she’s okay, which added to the situation.

However, a few weeks before the wedding, my sister called me and said that they had decided to limit the guest list to just immediate family and a few close friends. She told me that unfortunately, she couldn't invite my husband (28) and me because they were concerned about the costs associated with having more guests.

I was really disappointed but tried to be understanding. I figured it was their special day, and I wanted them to have what they wanted. However, I was still sad about missing out on what I knew would be a beautiful event. I decided to plan a small celebration for just my family and a few friends back home the weekend of the wedding to celebrate their marriage in my own way.

The day of the wedding, I posted some pictures from our little get-together on social media, tagging my sister and wishing her a beautiful day. I didn’t mean to rub it in, but I was just excited to celebrate love. A few hours later, I received a call from my sister, who was upset that I had posted about our gathering while she was getting married. She felt it overshadowed her day, and that I should have been more considerate.

I apologized for making her feel that way and explained that I honestly just wanted to celebrate in my own way since I couldn’t be there. I told her I didn’t intend to upset her, but she was still hurt.

No one is the Asshole,"My (F28) boyfriend (M30) and I have been dating for about a year and a half. We both enjoy cooking, but he has a tendency to be a bit of a perfectionist in the kitchen. He loves to try new recipes and has a great palate, while I’m more of an experimental cook who enjoys throwing things together and seeing what happens.

Recently, we decided to host a dinner for some of our friends. I was excited and wanted to contribute, so I suggested we make a few dishes together. I had some ideas for appetizers and a dessert that I thought would be fun. He seemed on board but then started critiquing my ideas almost immediately, saying they wouldn’t pair well with the main dish he had in mind and that my execution might not turn out as good as his.

I felt a bit deflated but tried to be understanding. So, I said, ""Why don’t we cook together and see how it goes? If it doesn’t work, we can always adjust."" He agreed, but as we started cooking, he kept taking over my tasks and suggesting changes without asking me first. I ended up feeling more like a sous-chef than a co-cook.

At one point, I got frustrated and said, “I want to contribute too, you know? It’s not fun if I can’t do my part.” He seemed surprised and a bit hurt. We ended up having a small argument about it, but ultimately, we decided to finish cooking together. I took a step back and let him lead for the most part, while I chimed in when I felt it was necessary.

The dinner went well, and our friends loved the food, but I still felt a little disappointed about how things went in the kitchen. After the dinner, I brought it up to him, saying that I appreciated his skills, but I also wanted to feel more involved in our cooking together. He apologized and said he didn’t mean to overshadow me, and that he just got caught up in wanting everything to be perfect.

So, I recently graduated from college, and my family is very important to me. My parents and my younger sister have always been supportive, and we’ve been through a lot together. I decided to throw a small graduation gathering at my house, inviting just family and a few close friends to celebrate this milestone.

Leading up to the party, I was super excited. I put a lot of effort into planning it—decorations, food, drinks, and even a little slideshow of memories from my time in college. I let my family know well in advance about the date, and everyone said they’d be there.

On the day of the party, I was ready and had everything set up. A couple of hours in, I started to notice that my sister was acting a bit distant. She wasn’t engaging with anyone and seemed off. When I asked her if she was okay, she brushed it off, saying she was just tired.

Later, during the gathering, I overheard her talking to our parents in another room. I couldn’t hear everything, but I caught bits about how she was feeling overwhelmed and how she thought the party was too much pressure for me. I felt a bit hurt because I had put so much effort into making this day special and it seemed like she didn’t appreciate that.

After the guests left, I confronted her about it, trying to understand her perspective. She shared that she felt anxious about the attention I was getting and that she struggles with comparison. I recognize that graduation can be a tough time for siblings, and I tried to reassure her that it was a celebration for both of us—our family’s accomplishments, not just mine.

We ended up having a long conversation, and while I was initially upset, I realized she was dealing with her own feelings. I apologized if I made her feel overshadowed, and she apologized for not voicing her feelings sooner. We both ended the night feeling a little better, but I’m left wondering if I handled it the right way.

Last weekend, we decided to have a movie night at home. Lucy had been looking forward to it all week and was excited to pick out a film. As we were getting ready, she asked if it was okay for her to invite a friend over. I thought it was a great idea, as it would make the night even more fun. 

When her friend Mia arrived, the dynamic changed a bit. They were both giggly and started joking around in a way that made me feel a little out of place. I tried to join in on the fun by making some light-hearted jokes, but it seemed like they were more interested in their own inside jokes. At one point, Lucy said, “Stop it, you’re being so cringey!” and both of them erupted in laughter. 

I felt a bit hurt by that, but I also understood that they were just kids having fun. I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it, so I laughed along and let it go. However, later in the evening, I decided to talk to Sam about how I felt. I expressed that I felt a little excluded and that it’s hard to connect when they’re in their own world.

Sam was really understanding and told me that it’s normal for kids to have their own dynamics, especially at that age. Together, we talked to Lucy and Mia, and they were sweet about it. Lucy said she didn’t mean to make me feel bad and that she just got carried away. Mia chimed in, saying that they just thought I was being funny. 

Ultimately, we all ended up having a great night, and I appreciated Sam’s support in helping navigate the moment. I know it’s a learning experience for both me and Lucy, and I hope we can continue building our bond as she grows up.

I never thought Sarah would invite him, and I honestly didn’t want to be around him at all.

The night before the party, I talked to Sarah and expressed my concerns. I told her that I didn’t feel comfortable attending if Mike was going to be there.

I totally get that, and I told her that I didn’t want to ruin her day, but I also didn’t want to be in a situation that made me unhappy.

My manager pointed out that while I did contribute, the bulk of the work was my colleague’s.

I found it a bit frustrating because I wanted to focus on the discussion about the book instead of her life story. I did my best to steer the conversation back by asking questions related to the book or by making comments that referenced the text, but she would just shift the topic back to her own experiences. 

After a while, I finally said, “I appreciate your insights, but can we focus more on the book itself? There’s so much to discuss about the themes and characters.” She seemed taken aback, and the mood shifted. The other members looked a bit uncomfortable, and we ended up discussing the book more, but I felt guilty about how I had put her on the spot.

When I got home, I shared the experience with my friend, who said I might have come off as rude. I thought I was just trying to keep the discussion on track, but now I’m second-guessing myself. I didn’t intend to make her feel unwelcome, but I also didn’t want the meeting to turn into a personal sharing session. 

So, AITA for trying to refocus a conversation back to the book during the book club?

TL;DR: I interrupted a new member at a book club to keep the discussion focused on the book instead of her personal stories, and now I’m wondering if I was rude. AITA?",977,2916,0.78,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_88523,2020-03-14 00:00:00,NAH,1697,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I'm a 17-year-old high school student, and I recently started a group project with a few classmates for our science class. We were supposed to create a presentation about renewable energy sources. At the first meeting, we all agreed to divide the work evenly, with each of us taking a specific topic to research and present.

As the project progressed, I noticed that one of my group members, Alex, wasn't contributing as much as the rest of us. He often missed meetings and didn't complete his assigned research. I tried reaching out to him a couple of times, offering help and asking if he was okay, but he just brushed it off and seemed disengaged.

With the deadline approaching, I got worried about our presentation and decided to talk to the teacher about the group dynamics. I didn't want to throw anyone under the bus, but I felt it was important to express that our group was struggling and that one member wasn't fulfilling their responsibilities. My teacher suggested I speak directly to Alex and encourage him to step up.

When I approached Alex, he seemed defensive and said he was going through some personal issues that made it hard for him to focus. I felt bad for him, but I also explained that we really needed him to contribute for the project to be successful. He apologized and promised to do his best, but I still wasn't sure if it would be enough.

In the end, we managed to pull together a decent presentation, but it was a stressful experience. I felt conflicted about talking to the teacher because I didn't want to be seen as a snitch, but I also wanted the project to succeed. 

So, am I the asshole for going to the teacher about Alex's lack of participation, or was I just trying to ensure the project's success?",590,2787,0.97,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_65519,2024-06-01 00:00:00,NAH,1742,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I (28F) recently faced a bit of tension with my parents (both in their 60s) over my decision to pursue a career in the arts, specifically as an illustrator. Ever since I was a child, I loved drawing and creating, but my parents always encouraged me to pursue a ""stable"" career, like law or medicine. 

After finishing college with a degree in fine arts, I landed a part-time job as a freelance illustrator, which I love. It's not the most stable income, but I'm passionate about my work and believe that I can make it a viable career in the future. I've been saving up for a small art studio space to work from home more effectively and to grow my business.

Recently, during a family dinner, I shared with them my exciting news about a potential collaboration with a local publishing company. My parents' reaction was surprisingly negative. They expressed their concerns about my financial future and encouraged me to look for a ""real job"" instead of focusing on art. They even mentioned how much they sacrificed to send me to college and how they worried that I was wasting my education.

I tried to explain my passion and my plans for the future, but they just kept bringing up their concerns. It felt disheartening, especially since I've been working hard to establish myself. I ended up feeling frustrated and hurt, and I told them that their lack of faith in my dreams was disappointing. 

After the dinner, I had a long conversation with my sister (32F), who also pursued a career in the arts after initially studying business. She reassured me that our parents truly care, but they just don't understand the current landscape of creative professions. She suggested that maybe I should take some time to show them my work and the progress I’ve made, so they can see that I’m serious about my career.

I feel torn. I want my parents to support me, but I also understand that they come from a different generation and perspective. I don’t want to be dismissive of their concerns, especially since they have my best interests at heart. But I also don’t want to give up on my dreams because of their worries. 

What do you think? Am I being too defensive about my choices, or are my parents being too overprotective?",733,2033,0.76,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_27151,2022-09-25 00:00:00,NAH,2219,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I'm a 19-year-old college student, and I live with three other roommates. We all agreed at the beginning of the semester that we would take turns cooking dinner for the group a few times a week to save money and make things easier. 

Last week, it was my turn to cook, and I decided to make a vegetarian stir-fry because one of my roommates is vegetarian. I put a lot of effort into it and wanted it to be something everyone could enjoy. However, when I served it, one of my other roommates, who is a big meat lover, openly expressed that he didn’t think the meal looked good and wouldn’t eat it. 

I felt a bit hurt because I had put a lot of work into the meal and I thought it was considerate to cater to everyone's dietary needs. I tried to stay positive and encouraged him to at least give it a try, but he just shrugged it off and went to make a frozen pizza instead. 

After dinner, I brought it up with the group, saying I felt disappointed that my effort wasn’t appreciated. The vegetarian roommate defended me, but the meat-lover said he didn’t mean to hurt my feelings and just really prefers meat. It turned into a bit of a debate about cooking for others and accommodating preferences.

In the end, we resolved it by agreeing to communicate better about meals moving forward, and I told them I’d appreciate them trying my dishes next time.

No one is the Asshole,"Hey everyone, I’m looking for some perspective on a situation I recently found myself in.

So, I’m 26 and I’ve been really focused on my career the past few years. I’ve had a few close friends, but I haven’t had a lot of time to invest in social activities outside of work. Recently, one of my friends from college invited me to her wedding, which I was really excited about. 

However, when I got the invitation, I noticed that it was a “no plus ones” event. I totally understand that weddings can get expensive, and I respect her decision. But I have a close friend, let’s call him Mark, who’s been through a tough breakup recently. He’s been feeling pretty lonely and down since his long-term relationship ended, and I thought it might really lift his spirits to come with me as my plus one. I decided to reach out to my friend and ask if it would be okay for him to join me, explaining the situation and how much it could mean for him.

She responded saying that while she appreciates where I’m coming from, she really wanted to keep it an intimate gathering and would prefer to stick to the original guest list. I understood and respected her wishes, but I felt bad for Mark, so I invited him to hang out the weekend of the wedding instead. 

When I told Mark about the wedding and the situation, he was disappointed but appreciated that I thought of him. He mentioned that it’s hard for him to see friends getting married and moving on, which made me realize how tough this must be for him. 

In the end, I went to the wedding solo and had a wonderful time reconnecting with old friends. I told Mark all about it afterward, and we ended up having a fun weekend together. However, some of our mutual friends found out I asked to bring him and felt I was being inconsiderate to the bride for even asking. They think I should have just respected the “no plus ones” policy without question.

So, AITA for asking my friend if I could bring Mark to her wedding? I genuinely wanted to help him feel better during a tough time, but I also respect my friend’s wishes. Would love your thoughts!",797,2112,0.68,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_70071,2020-01-28 00:00:00,NAH,2090,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I recently reconnected with an old friend from high school. We had a really close friendship back then, but life took us in different directions, and we lost touch for several years. When we started talking again, I was excited to hear about everything she’s been up to, and it turns out she’s been working hard on her art and is now a professional painter.

She invited me to her first solo art exhibition, and I was genuinely thrilled for her. However, when I arrived at the gallery, I noticed a few things that made me uncomfortable. Most notably, the gallery was pretty crowded, and it felt more like a social event than a celebration of her art. I saw a lot of people who seemed to be there just to network or take selfies rather than appreciate the artwork. 

Throughout the evening, my friend was preoccupied with mingling and making small talk with guests, which left little time for us to catch up. I tried to engage with her a couple of times, but she was always pulled away by someone else. After a while, I started to feel a bit neglected and out of place, so I decided to leave.

I texted her later to congratulate her and let her know I enjoyed the pieces I saw, but I also mentioned that I felt a bit lost in the crowd and wished we could have spent more time together. She responded saying she was sorry I felt that way but that it was a busy night for her, and she hoped I understood.

Now I’m wondering if I was wrong to bring up my feelings about not getting to spend time with her. I just wanted her to know that while I’m proud of her achievements, I also missed the personal connection we used to have.

So, my sister has been dating this guy for about six months. While I’ve met him a couple of times, I never really connected with him. He’s nice enough, but they seem to have some pretty different interests and values. Recently, she invited me over for dinner to meet his parents, which was a big step for her, and she really wanted my support.

I agreed to go, wanting to be there for her. When I arrived, I noticed that her boyfriend’s family was very traditional and had some pretty strong views on gender roles and relationships that didn’t sit well with me. During dinner, they made several comments about how women should prioritize family over careers, which I found quite outdated. I tried to stay respectful, but I couldn’t help but subtly challenge some of their statements. 

My sister looked visibly uncomfortable as the conversation progressed, and I realized I might be putting her in a tough spot. After dinner, when we were outside, she asked me why I had to push back against her boyfriend’s family. I explained that I just wanted to stand up for her and what I thought was right. She said she appreciated my intentions but that she wasn’t ready for that kind of confrontation, especially in front of his parents.

We ended up having a bit of a disagreement about how to handle the situation, and she felt caught between wanting to defend her beliefs and not wanting to create tension. I apologized for putting her in that position and told her I’d support her in whatever way she felt was best in the future.

In the end, we both walked away feeling a bit frustrated. I was just trying to be a supportive brother, and she was just trying to navigate a challenging relationship. I don’t want to see her unhappy, but I also understand that she has to figure this out in her own way.

My cousin has always been on the heavier side, and over the years, her weight has become a sensitive topic in our family. I’ve always tried to be supportive and encouraging, but I know that conversations about weight can often lead to hurt feelings.

During the party, we were all sitting around the table eating, and I noticed my cousin was being quiet. After a while, she mentioned that she had been feeling really down about her weight and body image. I could see she was struggling, and honestly, I felt for her. I tried to lighten the mood and said, “Hey, we’re all here to celebrate you, not judge each other. Plus, we still have cake to eat, right?” Everyone laughed, but I could tell my cousin wasn't in the same lighthearted spirit.

A little later in the evening, while we were chatting, she brought up her weight again and how hard it was for her to stick to a healthy lifestyle. I wanted to be supportive, so I said, “Have you thought about maybe finding a workout buddy or trying some classes together? I’d totally join you!” She looked really taken aback and said, “Wow, thanks for pointing that out. I didn’t ask for advice.” I was honestly just trying to help, but I could see that my suggestion made her uncomfortable.

After that, the atmosphere became a bit tense, and I felt really bad. I apologized for overstepping and explained that I was just trying to be supportive. She told me she appreciated the sentiment but just wanted to vent without any suggestions. I completely understood and assured her I could just listen next time.

We ended up finishing the night on a somewhat awkward note. I did my best to reassure her that I care about her and that I’m there for her if she ever needs to talk.

We both work from home, and we have different work schedules. I usually like to start my day early and enjoy a quiet atmosphere to focus.

Unfortunately, they were quite loud, going back and forth between the kitchen and their room, leaving cabinets open and even playing music. I felt my concentration slipping away and got really frustrated.

Eventually, I walked out to the kitchen and politely asked them to keep it down a bit since I had an important task to finish. My roommate seemed taken aback and said they didn’t realize I was working so intensely and that they were just trying to start their day. They assured me they would be quieter, but I could tell they were a bit hurt by my request.

A couple of months later, Sarah started expressing frustration about how lonely she felt and how she wished she could just ""get away"" for a bit. I suggested a weekend trip to a nearby beach town where we used to go for fun. She loved the idea, and we started planning it together.

As the trip approached, I received an unexpected opportunity to take a job offer in another state. It’s a great career move for me, but the timing meant I’d be moving just a week before our planned trip. I felt terrible about it, as I really wanted to be there for Sarah, but I couldn’t pass on this opportunity.

When I told Sarah about the job offer and that I would have to cancel our trip, she was upset. She said she felt abandoned and thought that I was prioritizing my career over our friendship. I tried explaining that it wasn't about her, but I also needed to take care of my own life. We ended up having a long conversation where I reassured her that I would always support her and would make time to visit when I could.

Now I’m feeling conflicted. I understand she’s hurting, and I want to be there for her, but I also have to focus on my own future. I genuinely believe that both of us are doing what we need to do, but I wonder if I’m being insensitive by taking this opportunity right now.

So, am I the asshole for taking the job and canceling our trip, or is it understandable given the circumstances? I’d love to hear what others think.",935,1647,0.54,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_46402,2021-07-22 00:00:00,NAH,1972,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So I recently had a small get-together at my apartment with some close friends. We’ve all been busy with our lives, so it was nice to catch up and enjoy a laid-back evening together. I planned to keep it simple with snacks and drinks, and everyone was excited to hang out.

A couple of days before the gathering, one of my friends, Sarah, reached out to me. She mentioned that her brother was in town and asked if he could join us. I didn’t know him very well, but I thought it would be okay since it was a casual gathering. However, I also remembered that our friend Mark tends to be quite critical and doesn’t hold back when sharing his opinions, especially about people he doesn’t know.

I ended up telling Sarah that I was okay with her brother coming, but I also mentioned that I was a bit concerned about how Mark might interact with him. I suggested that they could maybe meet up separately to avoid any awkwardness. Sarah understood my concerns but still wanted her brother to come. I felt bad for suggesting that, but I wanted everyone to have a good time without any potential drama.

On the day of the get-together, Sarah brought her brother, and things went relatively smoothly at first. But as the night went on, Mark made a few offhand comments that could have come off as rude, and I noticed that Sarah’s brother looked uncomfortable. I tried to steer the conversation away from topics that would upset anyone, but it was hard to keep it going smoothly.

Afterward, Sarah messaged me saying she appreciated the invite but felt that Mark was a bit harsh towards her brother and that she wished I had been more assertive in setting boundaries. I messaged back explaining my concerns before the gathering and that I genuinely wanted everyone to have fun.

Now I’m wondering if I should have just flat-out told Sarah that Mark shouldn’t come either, or if I was right to try to accommodate both of them.

No one is the Asshole,"So, my cousin is getting married in a few months, and she asked me to be a bridesmaid. I was so excited and immediately agreed. However, she mentioned that she really wants a specific type of dress for all the bridesmaids, and it’s a style that I personally don’t feel comfortable in. It’s a very fitted, strapless design, and I’ve always preferred dresses that are more flowy and cover my arms.

I explained to my cousin how I felt about the dress and asked if we could find a style that still fits her theme but makes me feel more comfortable. She seemed disappointed but said she would think about it. A week later, she told me that the dress code would stay as is, and she really wants everyone to wear the same dress.

I didn’t want to let her down, but I also didn’t want to wear a dress that makes me feel uncomfortable. I finally decided to tell her I wouldn’t be able to be a bridesmaid if it meant wearing that dress. She seemed hurt, but I explained that I want to support her and be happy for her, but I also have to feel good in what I'm wearing on such an important day.

In the end, she asked me to still come to the wedding and be part of the day in some other way, maybe as a guest or helping with other things. I felt bad for putting her in that position, but I also want to be true to myself.

I was at a local coffee shop on a Saturday morning, which is typically busy but the vibe is always chill. I was working on my laptop at a table near the window. The coffee shop has a few communal tables, and while I was focused on my work, I noticed a group of four friends come in, all of them in their early twenties, and they took over the long communal table next to mine.

They were loud and animated, clearly having a great time catching up, but they were also quite disruptive. At one point, they started playing a game on their phones, which involved a lot of shouting and laughter. I glanced over, and while I found them having fun a bit annoying, I didn’t say anything because I know how it can be when you’re just trying to enjoy time with friends.

After about half an hour, I had enough of the noise. I politely asked them if they could lower their voices a bit since I was trying to focus on my work. They looked surprised but didn’t seem offended, and one of them said, “Oh, we didn’t realize we were being that loud! We’ll tone it down.” 

They did quiet down a bit, and I continued with my work. A little later, after they had finished their drinks, they left. As they were walking out, one of the friends turned back and said, “Thanks for saying something! We didn’t mean to disturb you.” 

I felt relieved that they were understanding, but I wasn’t sure if I had overstepped by asking them to be quieter. So, am I the asshole for speaking up, or was it a reasonable request?",11,1681,0.8,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_41688,2018-11-16 00:00:00,NAH,1509,AITA

However, my brother has been feeling a lot of pressure since his graduation, especially since he hasn’t landed a job yet. 

To help him unwind, I decided to surprise him with a small gathering to celebrate his accomplishment. I invited a few close friends and family members, and I planned some fun games and a cake. I thought it would be a good way to remind him that we’re proud of him, regardless of his job situation.

The day of the gathering, my brother seemed off. When I asked him if he was okay, he expressed that he felt embarrassed about not having a job yet and didn’t want to celebrate something he felt he hadn’t truly achieved. I understood where he was coming from, but I felt that it was important to celebrate his hard work and the fact that he graduated in the first place.

I tried to reassure him that everyone goes at their own pace and that it's okay to take time to find the right job. I told him that this gathering was meant to be a positive space and not a judgmental one. However, during the celebration, he seemed disengaged and eventually left early, saying he needed some time alone.

Afterward, I felt conflicted. I wanted to support my brother and celebrate his achievements, but I also didn’t want to make him feel uncomfortable or pressured. I considered whether I should have canceled the gathering or approached it differently.

When I arrived, the atmosphere was lively, and everyone seemed excited about the food. I set my lasagna down on the table and joined the others for some conversation. As people started serving themselves, I noticed that my friend, the host, was receiving a lot of compliments about the food he had prepared. He had made a large, beautiful salad and some homemade bread, which were indeed impressive.

However, as the evening progressed, I overheard a few guests commenting on how delicious the lasagna looked but then dismissing it because they were focused on the other dishes. I felt a bit disheartened since I had put a lot of effort into making it.

After everyone had finished eating, my friend made a toast and thanked everyone for bringing dishes. He then mentioned how proud he was of his salad and bread, and while I understood it was his gathering, I couldn't help but feel that my dish was overshadowed. I decided to speak up and say, ""Thanks for hosting, but I really hoped everyone would try my lasagna too; it’s a family recipe."" 

Some guests chuckled, and my friend quickly reassured me that my lasagna was appreciated, but it felt like a bit of awkwardness lingered. Later, one of the guests pulled me aside and said that I shouldn't have brought up my dish like that because it made me look insecure. I felt embarrassed and wondered if maybe I had overstepped.

When I got to college, I decided to join a recreational soccer league, purely for fun. The first few games were amazing—I felt free and was just enjoying the sport without the stress. However, my parents found out and were furious. They assumed I was wasting my potential and that I should be trying out for the college team instead. They even went as far as to tell me that I was letting them down.

After a particularly heated conversation, I snapped and told them that they had taken all the joy out of soccer for me. I said that I wanted to play for myself, not for them or anyone else, and that their incessant pressure had made me resent the sport. I told them that they should be happy that I was playing at all, instead of focusing on what level I was playing at. They were taken aback, and my mom ended up crying.

No one is the Asshole,"Title: AITA for wanting to choose my room in our new house based on my history as the long-term resident?

So, my (18F) best friend (19F) and her younger sister (16F) recently moved in with my family due to some family issues at their home. We’ve all known each other for years, and while I’m happy to help them out, it’s been a bit of a challenge adjusting to the new living situation. 

We currently live in a three-bedroom apartment. My parents have their room, and I’ve been in the smaller room while my best friend and her sister are sharing the third bedroom. We’ve been living together for about four months now, and the arrangement has been pretty good overall, but I have some concerns about our soon-to-be new place.

We’ve just signed a lease for a new apartment that has four bedrooms, a larger living space, and more privacy for all of us. The plan is that my friend and her sister will share one room again, and I’ll get to choose between the two remaining bedrooms. This is where the issue arises.

My best friend thinks she should get to choose her room first since she’s older and has been living there with me for a while now. She argues that since she’s used to being independent and living on her own, she should get the better room. I completely understand where she’s coming from, but I feel like I’ve been the long-term resident in my family’s home and that I should have the first pick when it comes to choosing my room.

I’ve been living in our current apartment for 18 years, while she has only been around for the last four months. Yes, we are best friends and I want to be fair, but I also think my history with the space should give me some priority. I want to point out that I've always kept my space tidy and contributed to keeping the common areas clean, and I feel like I deserve to get a room that gives me some privacy as I navigate adulthood.

My friend is also worried that if she ends up with the smaller room again, it will be difficult for her to have friends over or feel comfortable in her space. I understand that too, as I wouldn’t want to feel cramped or uncomfortable in my own home. 

So, I’m wondering, AITA for wanting to choose my room in the new apartment based on my long-standing residency and contribution to the household, or is my best friend right to feel like she should have more say since she's living there too?",316,1292,0.55,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_62934,2024-04-08 00:00:00,NAH,2372,AITA

Lately, my girlfriend has been feeling overwhelmed with work and has started to bring her laptop into our bedroom to catch up on tasks late at night. I usually go to bed around 11 PM because I have to be up early for work, and I try to keep a consistent sleep schedule. The problem is that her working in the bedroom keeps me up; the light from her screen and the sound of typing are really distracting.

It’s been really stressful for me, and I feel like I'm not able to recharge for my job.

One night, after a particularly long day, I asked her again if she could please try to work in the living room. I explained that I was feeling really exhausted and needed to prioritize my sleep.

I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings. I understand that she has a lot on her plate, but I also think that we need to respect each other’s space and needs. We talked it out, and I suggested we set a specific time when she stops working in the bedroom, so I can have that time to wind down.

In the end, we both apologized to each other. I told her I appreciate the hard work she’s doing, and she acknowledged that she needs to be more mindful of my need for sleep.

A few months ago, my best friend and I were planning a weekend camping trip. We were really excited about it since it's been a while since we had a chance to hang out just the two of us. We both love nature and exploring new places, so we chose a beautiful national park that we had both been wanting to visit.

About a week before the trip, my friend casually mentioned that she was thinking about inviting another friend of hers, Alex, to join us. I was a little taken aback since it was supposed to be just the two of us, but I didn't want to be mean or possessive. I told her that I was fine with it, but I also expressed that I was looking forward to having some quality time together.

As the trip approached, I started feeling anxious about it. I've always had a special bond with my friend, and I worried that bringing another person along would change the dynamic of our trip. I felt like I might not get to connect with her as much if Alex was there. 

On the day of the trip, we met up, and Alex turned out to be really nice and friendly. I tried my best to be welcoming, but I couldn't shake the feeling of being a little overshadowed. My best friend and Alex hit it off quickly, sharing jokes and stories while I felt like I was just tagging along. Throughout the trip, I found myself withdrawing and feeling left out, which only made me more anxious.

At one point, during a hike, I expressed to my friend that I felt a bit uncomfortable with the situation and that I was missing our one-on-one time. I didn't mean to come off as demanding or upset, but I think I might have sounded a bit harsh. My friend seemed surprised and a bit hurt, saying she thought we could all have fun together and that she didn’t realize I was feeling left out.

I'm (M30) in a bit of a dilemma with my friend group. We have a tradition of going on an annual camping trip together, and this year, it was my turn to organize everything. I've been really excited about it, planning activities and meals. 

However, I just found out that one of my friends, Alex (M29), is bringing his new girlfriend, whom none of us have met yet. While I'm happy for him, I'm also a bit concerned because our group is very close-knit, and we typically keep the trips just to us. I mentioned to Alex that I thought it would be more comfortable if it was just the original group this year, especially since it's a tradition we’ve held for years.

Alex got really upset, saying that he wanted to share this experience with someone special and that it wasn’t fair to exclude her just because she’s new to the group. I completely understand where he's coming from, and I don’t want to hurt his feelings, but I also feel like this year should be about our established group dynamics.

After some back and forth, I decided to compromise.

I thought this way, she could gradually get to know us without feeling overwhelmed. 

Alex agreed, but I still feel like I might have overstepped by suggesting limits on how involved she should be. I genuinely don’t want to come off as unwelcoming, but I also want to preserve what has made our traditions feel special to us.

They argued that I should have consulted the team leader before reaching out for donations, as it was not my place to make those decisions independently. They felt I undermined the authority of the leadership and created unnecessary tension in the group.

Later, I apologized to the team leader for not involving them in my decision to seek donations, and they accepted my apology, acknowledging that the supplies would greatly benefit our future events. However, some team members still seem upset with me, viewing my actions as a breach of team dynamics.

Now I feel conflicted. I genuinely wanted to help improve our events and engage more volunteers. It wasn't my intention to create any discord.

No one is the Asshole,"I (17F) have a little brother, Jake (11M), who has been diagnosed with ADHD. He’s a sweet kid, but sometimes his impulsivity can be overwhelming, especially when he gets super excited or anxious. My parents have been doing their best to support him, but I know how tough it can be for them too.

Recently, we had a family game night, which is usually a lot of fun. But that night, Jake was particularly restless. He kept interrupting everyone, making random noises, and bouncing around the room. I could see my parents getting frustrated, trying to remind him to calm down, but it wasn’t working. I was feeling overwhelmed too, as I was really looking forward to a relaxing night with my family.

At one point, when it was my turn to play, Jake shouted something out that totally distracted me. I snapped at him, telling him to stop being annoying and to just let me play in peace. I instantly regretted it because I could see his face fall. My parents were upset with me too, and they told me that I needed to be more patient with him.

I felt terrible afterward and tried to apologize to him, but he was still sulking. I ended up talking to my parents about it, and they helped me understand that Jake can't always control his impulses, and that I should be more compassionate.

I’ve been trying to be more mindful of my words and my reactions since that night. I don’t want Jake to feel like he’s a burden or that he’s annoying, especially when he’s just being himself. I know I should have handled it better, but I was really frustrated in the moment.

So, AITA for snapping at my little brother during game night? I didn’t mean to hurt him, and I’m trying to learn from this experience.",951,2415,0.9,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_19705,2022-03-20 00:00:00,NAH,1691,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Context: My partner and I had been planning a surprise birthday party for our mutual friend for months. We decided on a small gathering with close friends and family at our home. To keep it a surprise, we made a group chat specifically for the people who were in on it, and we agreed on a budget for food and decorations. Everyone was excited, and we all helped to chip in for the costs.

As the date approached, one of our friends, Alex, kept asking if they could bring their partner, who was not part of the original guest list since we wanted to keep it intimate. I replied that we really wanted to keep it a surprise and that our friend might feel overwhelmed with too many people there. Alex seemed disappointed but eventually agreed.

A few days before the party, Alex texted saying they couldn't make it because they were feeling unwell. I was relieved, thinking the surprise would go smoothly. However, on the night of the party, I noticed that Alex still posted on social media from a different location. It turned out they had gone out with their partner instead of attending the surprise party.

I felt hurt and betrayed because I had genuinely tried to accommodate them, and it seemed like they didn't respect the effort we put into the party. I ended up expressing my feelings to them, which led to some tension between us. It wasn’t my intention to start a conflict; I just felt let down.

She's currently in her final year of college and has decided to take a gap year to travel around the world. She’s super excited about it and has been saving up for this trip for a while. 

The thing is, our parents have been really supportive of her decision. However, they’ve also been pressuring her to finish her degree first, saying that she can travel after she graduates. This has caused a lot of tension between my sister and our parents. I’ve tried to stay neutral and support her dreams, but I also understand where our parents are coming from since they just want her to have a solid foundation before embarking on something so adventurous.

Recently, my sister asked me for advice on how to handle their pressure. I told her that it’s ultimately her life and she should do what feels right for her, but I also suggested that she have a heart-to-heart conversation with our parents. I figured that if they understood her passion and plans better, they might be more supportive.

She ended up having that conversation, and while our parents were initially resistant, they eventually came around after hearing her reasoning. Now, they’ve agreed to support her gap year as long as she commits to finishing her degree when she returns.

I feel good about the way things turned out, but I can't help but think that my sister may have felt caught in the middle at times.

I waved at him and asked if he wanted to help. I explained that I could use an extra set of hands and that I’d pay him $20 for a couple of hours of work. He seemed excited and agreed.

We spent the afternoon together, painting a wooden fence and moving some garden supplies around. I showed him how to use the paintbrush properly and how to mix the paint. He was eager to learn and even came up with some ideas for how to make the fence look better. I was impressed by his enthusiasm and creativity.

After we finished up, I handed him the $20 as promised. He thanked me and ran back to his house, looking proud of what we accomplished. Later, I noticed his parents waiting outside when I went to take the trash out. They approached me and expressed that they were surprised their son was working for money without their permission. They mentioned they weren’t comfortable with him doing that and were concerned about him using tools.

I apologized for not consulting them first and explained that I thought he was having fun and learning something new. They seemed to appreciate my honesty but were still a bit upset. We ended the conversation on amicable terms, but I felt bad that I inadvertently caused tension.

A few weeks ago, Sarah mentioned she was struggling to find time for herself because of her busy schedule with work and parenting. I offered to help out and suggested that I could watch her son for a couple of hours on Saturday mornings while she takes some time for herself. She was really grateful and we set up a schedule.

I felt hurt because I thought we had established a good rapport, and I genuinely wanted to help her out. I texted her back and reassured her that I would never do anything to make her uncomfortable and that if she needed to stop, I would completely understand. 

I also let her know that I hoped she could trust me, as I am responsible and have experience with children. She responded saying she appreciated my understanding.

She would often text him instead of discussing our itinerary, and I felt like our time together was getting overshadowed. I brought it up to her in a lighthearted way, mentioning that I was excited for our girls’ weekend and wanted to make sure we had some quality time together.

She seemed surprised and a bit defensive, saying that she didn’t mean to neglect our plans and she just wanted him to have a good time too. I understood where she was coming from, but I felt like I was being pushed aside. To ease the tension, I suggested we have one day dedicated just to us, doing activities we had originally planned, and the other day could be more flexible with her boyfriend included.

I wanted to be supportive, so I invited her to my place for a weekend to relax and help her get her mind off things.

When she arrived, I was excited to spend time with her. I had planned some activities, like cooking together and watching our favorite movies. However, as the weekend progressed, I noticed that Mia seemed to want to stay in a more negative mindset. She would often bring up her ex, talk about her feelings of loneliness, and seemed to want to wallow in her sadness.

I’m all for listening and being there for her, but I also wanted to encourage her to find some joy and positivity. After a long day of her discussing her ex, I gently suggested that maybe we could focus on some fun activities instead of dwelling on the past. I told her that sometimes it helps to try to find a little joy amidst the pain, and I was here to help her with that.

Mia got upset and said that I wasn’t being supportive, and that she needed to process her feelings, which I completely understood. I apologized if it seemed like I was dismissing her feelings, but I just wanted to find a balance. We ended up having a small argument about it, and I felt bad for suggesting that we shift gears.

A couple of weeks into the season, he came home and told me that one of the kids on the team, Alex, was being bullied by some of the other players. I asked him to tell me more about it, and he explained that Alex was shy and not as skilled at soccer, which made him a target for teasing.

I encouraged my son to support Alex and stand up for him, which he did. He started inviting Alex to hang out after practice and even trained with him to help him improve his skills. I was really proud of him for being kind and inclusive.

However, I noticed that my son seemed to be feeling overwhelmed. He told me that while he liked helping Alex, he also felt pressured to be friendly with the other players who were still teasing him. It was a lot for him to navigate, and I could see he was struggling to balance his loyalty to Alex with his desire to fit in.

So, I had a talk with him about it. I explained that it’s okay to step back if he feels like he’s in a tough position and that he shouldn’t feel guilty for wanting to enjoy soccer without the weight of that responsibility.

I put together a nice set of paints, brushes, and canvases, along with a note encouraging him to use it as a creative outlet. Jake was genuinely touched and excited about the gift, and he started painting as a way to unwind after stressful days.

I could tell he was really struggling with this, so I suggested we set up a small art night with a couple of our other friends who also paint.

Jake agreed, and we planned a casual get-together. A few days before the art night, I sent out a group message to remind everyone and encourage them to bring their art supplies. I also mentioned I’d be bringing some snacks and drinks.

I appreciate her effort, but I felt sidelined and underappreciated. I wanted to help and contribute my ideas too, but whenever I brought it up, she brushed me off, saying she had it all under control. 

The day of the event arrived, and while it went well overall, I could see that a lot of family members noticed I was unhappy. A few of them approached me and asked why I seemed off. During the gathering, I ended up having a quiet conversation with a couple of relatives, expressing my feelings about being left out. 

Later, my sister overheard this and confronted me, saying I should have talked to her instead of airing my grievances to others. We ended up having a heated exchange. I felt it was valid to express how I felt, but I also recognized that she was just trying to do something nice for the family. 

I ended up apologizing to her for the way I handled it, and she acknowledged that she could have communicated better too. We both agreed to work on our communication moving forward. 

So, AITA for feeling frustrated and talking to relatives instead of directly addressing my sister about her controlling behavior?",174,1069,0.83,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_15783,2018-12-31 00:00:00,NAH,1589,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I recently started a new job and became friends with a coworker, Sarah, who is really great. We've been sharing lunch breaks and chatting a lot, and I genuinely enjoy her company. We talked about having a small get-together with some other coworkers to relax after work one day. I offered to host it at my place since I have a bit more space.

I planned everything in advance and sent out an invitation to a few coworkers, including Sarah. I was excited to have everyone over and even prepared some snacks and drinks. A couple of days before the get-together, Sarah texted me to say she might not be able to come because her partner suddenly had a change in schedule and needed her to help with something important.

I understood her situation and told her I completely get it. I encouraged her to prioritize her partner but expressed how much I would love to have her there, even if just for a bit. She appreciated that but still felt torn about attending. When the day of the get-together arrived, Sarah texted me again, saying she could make it for a short while after all, which made me happy!

When she arrived, she looked a bit stressed, and I noticed she was struggling to balance her time. She had to leave early to help her partner with something else, and I felt a bit guilty for wanting her to stay longer. She mentioned that she really wanted to be there for the group but also needed to be there for her partner, which I totally understood.

The evening went well, and everyone enjoyed themselves. Afterward, I sent her a message thanking her for coming, and she apologized for having to leave early. I reassured her it was no problem and that I was just glad she could join us at all. Reflecting on the whole situation, I wondered if I should have insisted she stay longer or if I should have just let her go knowing her partner needed her.

No one is the Asshole,"A few weeks ago, my friend group decided to plan a weekend camping trip. We usually split the costs for food and supplies evenly, which works well for us. I offered to take care of the campsite reservation and bring along some extra gear, since I have a larger tent and some camping equipment that I can lend out.

As we were planning, one of my friends suggested we make it a potluck-style trip where everyone brings a dish to share. I thought it was a great idea and agreed to bring some snacks and drinks. A few days before the trip, another friend mentioned they were really looking forward to having a big campfire dinner, and I realized I hadn’t thought about what we would cook.

On the day of the trip, we got set up, and I noticed that some people had brought a lot of food while others had brought very little. I offered to help with cooking dinner, but I felt overwhelmed when I saw the amount of food we had, especially since I hadn’t prepared anything substantial.

During dinner, one of my friends pointed out that I hadn’t contributed much to the meal, and I felt embarrassed. I explained that I had planned to bring snacks and treats, but didn’t realize how much food would be needed for the campfire dinner. Everyone was understanding, but I wondered if I should have done more.

After the trip, I felt guilty about not contributing more to the dinner and if I should apologize to the group for not meeting expectations. At the same time, I think everyone did have a great time, and I don’t want to create tension over it. So, I’m wondering if I was wrong for not bringing more substantial food or if it really was just a miscommunication.",20,1444,0.76,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_73926,2020-07-14 00:00:00,NAH,1656,AITA

I was excited to go, but I had a prior commitment to attend my cousin's wedding that same day. I felt bad about missing Sarah's birthday, especially since she had been there for me during tough times, so I decided to reach out to her and let her know.

In my message, I expressed how much I appreciated her friendship and how disappointed I was to miss her celebration. I also mentioned that I'd love to get together sometime soon to celebrate her birthday in a more personal way, just the two of us.

To my surprise, Sarah responded quite upset. She said that she felt hurt that I chose my cousin's wedding over her birthday and that it made her feel unimportant. I tried to explain my situation to her, emphasizing that it wasn't about prioritizing one over the other but simply a scheduling conflict. I wanted her to know that her birthday was significant to me, and I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings.

After some back-and-forth, I realized that while I didn't intend to make her feel undervalued, she was right to feel disappointed. It’s hard to juggle commitments, and I understand that sometimes things can get lost in translation. 

So, I offered to meet her the following week for coffee or dinner to celebrate her birthday properly. She seemed to appreciate that and agreed.

No one is the Asshole,"My best friend, Mia, has a younger brother, Alex, who is 10 and has ADHD. He can get really hyper and loud, especially when he's excited. Mia invited me to her birthday party, which was going to be at a local pizza place with a lot of other kids and their families. I was really looking forward to it, but I was also a bit anxious because I know Alex can sometimes become overwhelming in social situations.

A few days before the party, Mia mentioned that Alex might be staying home because her parents were concerned he wouldn't be able to handle the noise and excitement. They thought it might be better for him to have a calm evening instead. I felt bad for Alex, but honestly, I was also relieved because I was worried that he might distract from the celebration or make it hard for everyone to enjoy themselves.

When the party day came, Alex ended up being allowed to come after all, and he actually did really well! He was excited but managed to keep it contained for the most part. However, there were moments when he got a bit loud, and I could see some of the other kids looking a little unsure about how to react. Mia's parents were doing their best to keep him engaged and calm.

At one point, I took Alex aside to play a quieter game with him, just to give him a break from the noise and to help him focus. Mia thanked me for looking out for him, but I felt a bit guilty for being initially relieved that he might not come at all. I didn't want to seem like I was judging him or his behavior; I just wanted everyone to have a good time.

In the end, I think everyone had a fun time, and Alex even bonded with a few other kids. But I’m left wondering if it’s okay to feel a bit anxious about his presence in the future at big gatherings.

No one is the Asshole,"So here’s the deal. I’m a 22-year-old guy, and I live with my best friend, who is also 22, in a two-bedroom apartment. We’ve known each other for years, and we’re pretty comfortable living together. However, a bit of a situation has come up recently that I wanted to get some opinions on.

My friend is really into cooking, and he’s been experimenting with some new recipes. The issue is that he loves to cook late at night—like, really late, sometimes past midnight. I totally get that he’s passionate about it, but the problem is that our kitchen is right next to my bedroom, and he tends to make a lot of noise while he’s at it. The clanging of pots and pans, the sizzling sounds from the stove, and even the occasional music he plays while he cooks can get pretty loud.

I’ve talked to him about it a couple of times, asking if he could try to keep it down or maybe cook during the day instead. He’s apologized and said he doesn’t realize how loud he gets when he’s in the zone. However, the late-night cooking hasn’t changed much, and I’ve been finding it really hard to sleep. 

Recently, I came home after a long day, and he was in the kitchen blasting music and cooking at 1 AM. I snapped a little and asked him if he could try to keep it down because I really needed to sleep. He looked hurt and said he was just trying to unwind after a long day and that cooking was his way of relaxing.

I felt bad afterward because I know he didn’t mean to upset me, but I really was tired and frustrated. Now I’m wondering if I overreacted and if I should have approached the situation differently. 

So, am I the asshole for getting upset about my friend's late-night cooking, or is he being inconsiderate for not respecting my need for a quiet environment during the night?",18,2544,0.78,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_80539,2024-07-24 00:00:00,NAH,1772,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I've been living in my apartment for about two years now, and I have a neighbor who lives next door. We’ve exchanged pleasantries and small talk occasionally, but we’ve never really gotten to know each other. A few months ago, I noticed that she started having parties on weekends, which would often go pretty late into the night. The noise would sometimes keep me up, but I tried to be understanding because I remember being young and wanting to have fun.

Last weekend, she had a big birthday party, and the noise was overwhelming. I could hear the music and laughter from my living room, and it went on until about 3 AM. After tossing and turning for hours, I finally had enough and decided to knock on her door. When she opened it, I calmly explained that the noise was keeping me up and asked if she could lower it a bit. She was surprisingly defensive and told me it was her birthday and that she was just trying to have a good time.

I felt bad for interrupting her celebration, but I also reminded her that we live in an apartment complex, and it was getting late. We ended up having a bit of a back-and-forth, and she said that she’d try to keep it down, but she didn’t make any promises. The next night, I heard music again, but it wasn’t as loud, and I managed to get some sleep.

The whole situation made me feel guilty. I understand the need to celebrate, but I also think it’s important to respect others’ space. I’m not sure if I handled it poorly or if I was justified in bringing it up. I haven't talked to her since, and I don't want to create tension between us.

So, AITA for asking my neighbor to keep the noise down during her party?

Recently, though, we got into a bit of a situation regarding our mutual friend, Sam (27M), who we've both known for a long time. 

Sam and I went on a few casual dates a while back but decided to just stay friends because we didn’t have that romantic connection. My roommate, however, developed a crush on him after that and has been talking about wanting to ask him out. I didn’t think it was a big deal at first since we were all friends, and I figured Sam might not even be interested in dating anyone at the moment.

Last week, I overheard Sam mentioning to another friend that he still had feelings for me and that he wasn’t ready to date anyone, especially since we had been hanging out as friends. I felt bad keeping this from my roommate since she was getting her hopes up and I knew how much she liked him. I debated whether I should tell her or not because I didn’t want to hurt her feelings, but I also thought it was fair that she knew the truth.

So, I took a deep breath and decided to talk to her. I explained what I heard and that Sam wasn’t ready to date anyone right now. She was initially upset, feeling like I had kept something significant from her, but ultimately, she appreciated my honesty. We had a long discussion about relationships, feelings, and how sometimes things don’t work out the way we want them to.

One evening, I invited her over to watch a movie and catch up. She agreed, but then canceled at the last minute because her new boyfriend wanted to go out instead. I understood that she was excited about this new relationship, but I felt a bit neglected since we hadn’t spent quality time together in weeks.

The next time we spoke, I gently expressed how I missed our time together and felt a little sidelined by her new relationship. I told her that I was happy for her but hoped we could still find time for each other. She seemed taken aback and said that I was being selfish for expecting her to prioritize our friendship over her new relationship.

Recently, Jenna started a new job that she’s really excited about, but it also comes with a lot more stress and responsibility than her previous position. I’ve been trying to support her as much as possible, especially since she’s been feeling overwhelmed.

A few weeks ago, Jenna mentioned that she wanted to celebrate a successful week at work with a small gathering at her place. I thought it was a great idea, so I offered to help her organize everything. We agreed that we would split the costs and divide up responsibilities, which included food, drinks, and decorations.

As the day of the gathering approached, Jenna started to express anxiety about the expenses. She was worried about how much everything would cost, even though we both agreed to split it. I reassured her that it would be fine, and that we could keep it simple. But she kept stressing about it.

On the day of the gathering, I decided to surprise her and cover the costs of the main food and drinks myself as a way to lift some of that weight off her shoulders. I figured it would be a nice gesture since she’s been so stressed out lately. I didn’t tell her in advance because I wanted it to be a surprise.

When she saw everything set up, she was initially thrilled and grateful. However, I noticed that she looked uncomfortable when I mentioned how much I spent. She felt guilty that I had taken on the entire cost, and it led to an awkward conversation where she expressed that she didn’t want to feel like a burden.

In the end, I reassured her that it was genuinely my choice to do this and that I wanted her to enjoy her celebration without worrying about money.

My (28f) best friend, Sarah (29f), has been struggling with her mental health for a while now. She had a tough upbringing and has been open about her battles with anxiety and depression. Recently, she decided to take up painting as a form of therapy, and she’s really passionate about it. She even started posting her artwork on social media, and I think it’s amazing how far she’s come.

A couple of weeks ago, she invited me to an art show where she would be displaying some of her pieces. I was so proud of her and excited to support her. When I arrived, I noticed that a few of her paintings contained some really dark themes—things like isolation and despair—and I could tell they were very personal to her. I wanted to be supportive, but I was also a bit concerned that some of the imagery might be a lot for people to process, especially in a public setting.

After the show, we went out for coffee, and I brought up my concerns gently, saying something like, “I love that you’re being true to yourself and your feelings, but I wonder if you might consider adding something a bit lighter to your collection for future shows? It could really appeal to a wider audience.” Sarah didn’t take it the way I hoped. She looked hurt and said that this was her authentic expression, and if people couldn’t handle it, that was their issue. 

I felt awful for bringing it up and tried to explain that I wasn’t suggesting she change her art, but just considering the audience. We agreed to disagree, but the whole conversation left me feeling uneasy. I don’t want to stifle her creativity or make her feel invalidated, but I also worry that her art might be misunderstood or not appreciated the way she hopes.

I was genuinely excited for him, but I also noticed that he was spending significantly less time with our friend group, which included me.

Feeling a bit left out, I shared my feelings with a couple of mutual friends, jokingly saying that I guess I was being replaced.

Alex misinterpreted this and thought I was upset with him for dating someone new.

No one is the Asshole,"I’m a high school teacher, and I recently found myself in a bit of a dilemma with my students. I teach a subject that some kids really enjoy, while others see it as a chore. During this semester, I decided to implement a new grading policy that would allow for more creative projects instead of traditional tests. My goal was to engage the students and make learning more enjoyable.

I announced the new policy on the first day of the semester, and while many students were excited, a few expressed their frustration. They felt that a project-based assessment would be much harder than just taking a test. The students who were unhappy voiced their concerns to me, arguing that it was unfair to change the grading structure so suddenly and that it didn't accommodate everyone's learning style.

I tried to reassure them that the projects would be graded fairly and that I would provide guidelines to help them succeed. I also offered extra help sessions after school for anyone who felt overwhelmed. Despite my efforts, some students continued to complain, and it became a talking point among them.

A week later, one of my students suggested that I should allow traditional tests as an option for those who preferred them. I thought this was a reasonable compromise, so I brought the idea to the class. It sparked a big debate where both sides expressed their opinions passionately. In the end, I decided to let the students vote on whether they wanted a traditional test option alongside the projects.

The vote was split, and we ended up deciding to stick with the project-based approach but with the understanding that students could propose alternative methods of assessment if they could justify them. It felt like a win-win, but afterward, a few students still accused me of being inflexible and not listening to their concerns, while others praised me for trying something new.

I shared this story with a friend, who told me that I was the asshole for changing the grading policy without fully considering how it would affect all students.

My partner was disappointed and said that their aunt would be really honored to do it, and it would mean a lot to their family.

We ended up having a lengthy conversation where I voiced my concerns, and my partner shared their feelings about the importance of family and inclusivity. Ultimately, we decided to compromise: we would ask their aunt if she would be comfortable leading a portion of the ceremony while having a more traditional officiant for the official parts. 

It felt like a win-win because we’re both getting what we want, but I still wonder if it was wrong of me to initially push back on the idea.

No one is the Asshole,"I (30M) recently had a bit of a falling out with my sister (28F) over a family event, and I’m trying to figure out if I handled things poorly.

Our family has a tradition of gathering for a holiday dinner every year. For the past few years, I’ve taken on the responsibility of hosting since I have a larger space. This year, I decided to change the date to accommodate my schedule, as I had some work commitments that made the usual date difficult for me. I sent out a group message to the family, letting everyone know about the new date and time.

My sister was really upset about the change. She had already made plans to celebrate with her in-laws on the original date, and she felt I was inconsiderate for moving it without consulting anyone first. I honestly thought that since I was the one hosting, I could make that decision, especially since I had already informed everyone well in advance. I tried to explain my side, but she was very emotional and accused me of not caring about her or her commitments.

In the heat of the moment, I told her that she could still make it to our dinner since it was just a few hours apart from her other plans. This only made her angrier, and we both ended up saying things we didn’t mean. Eventually, she decided not to come at all, which led to some awkwardness at the dinner.

Afterwards, I reached out to her to apologize for how the conversation went and to express that I didn’t mean to upset her. She acknowledged that she may have overreacted but still felt I should have consulted with everyone before changing the date. Now I’m left wondering if I was really in the wrong for changing the date or if she was being too sensitive about it.

No one is the Asshole,"My best friend, Sarah, recently got engaged, and she's been planning her wedding for a few months now. She's really excited about it, and I totally support her. However, she has this idea of having a giant wedding party with a lot of attendants, and she asked me to be her maid of honor.

I was thrilled at first, but then Sarah started coming up with some pretty extravagant ideas for the bachelorette party and the wedding itself. She wants to go all out, and while I understand that it's her special day, I’m worried about the costs and how it might affect her and her fiancé’s finances. I also have some personal financial constraints right now, and I feel stressed about how I’ll be able to contribute to everything she wants.

When I expressed my concerns gently, she seemed hurt and thought I was trying to downplay her happiness. I assured her that I want her to have the wedding of her dreams but suggested we look for more budget-friendly options or alternatives. We ended up having a bit of a disagreement, and it made me feel guilty for trying to offer a different perspective.

Eventually, we talked it through, and she appreciated my honesty. We found some compromises that would still allow her to have a memorable experience without breaking the bank.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I wanted to share a situation I've been navigating with my neighbor, who is a kind elderly woman. She has a beautiful garden that she takes great pride in, and I often walk my two kids past her house on our way to the park. My kids love to stop and admire her flowers, and she always greets them with a warm smile.

A few weeks ago, I noticed that she has a couple of rose bushes that looked like they could use some trimming. I didn't want to overstep, but I casually mentioned to her during one of our chats that I’d be happy to help her with the pruning if she ever needed an extra pair of hands. She seemed appreciative but ultimately declined.

Fast forward to last weekend, I decided to take it upon myself to do a little bit of weeding in her garden while she was out running errands. I thought it would be a nice surprise for her when she came back. I made sure to be careful, and I even researched the best way to handle the plants so I wouldn’t damage anything. I spent a couple of hours tidying up those pesky weeds and neatly organized the area around her rose bushes.

When she returned, she was surprised to see the work I had done. At first, she was really happy and thankful, but then she seemed to become a little upset. She explained that she liked to tend to her garden herself and felt like I had overstepped by doing work she hadn’t asked for. I quickly apologized and tried to explain that my intentions were good, but I completely understood where she was coming from.

Now I’m left wondering if I was out of line for taking it upon myself to do something nice for her. I genuinely wanted to help, but I also respect her space and her right to care for her garden. So, am I the asshole for trying to help my neighbor in her garden without asking first?",637,1340,0.86,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_25626,2023-02-27 00:00:00,NAH,1779,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My sister (28) and I (25) have always had a close relationship, but we’ve recently hit a rough patch over something I didn’t anticipate becoming an issue. My sister has been struggling with her mental health, and while I’ve always been supportive, I noticed that it was starting to impact her daily life significantly. She tends to isolate herself and often cancels plans at the last minute, which is understandable given her struggles, but it’s starting to take a toll on me emotionally.

A few weeks ago, I invited her to a family gathering at our parents’ house. She initially agreed but then canceled the day before, claiming she was feeling too overwhelmed. I completely understood, but I couldn’t help feeling disappointed. I decided to go alone, and while there, I ended up having a great time catching up with other family members.

The next day, I posted a few pictures from the gathering on social media, including one of me laughing with our parents. I thought she’d be happy to see those moments, but when I texted her the link, she responded by saying it hurt to see me enjoying myself without her. I felt terrible, but I also thought it was important to live my life and not feel guilty for having a good time.

We had a long conversation about it, and I expressed that I miss her and want her to join us when she feels up to it. I also tried to explain that I wasn’t trying to exclude her; I just wanted to share our family moments. However, she accused me of being insensitive to her feelings.

Now, I’m left feeling torn. I want to be supportive and understanding of her situation, but I also don’t want to stop living my life or feel guilty for enjoying moments with my family.

No one is the Asshole,"**Title:** WIBTA for not helping my friend with a project I disagree with?

**Current situation:**

I have a close friend, Sarah, who is working on a community project aimed at promoting the use of single-use plastics for convenience in certain local businesses. While I get that her intentions are to help local shops and make things easier for customers, I personally believe that promoting single-use plastics is harmful to the environment and goes against the current movement towards sustainability.

Sarah knows my stance on the issue, and she initially approached me to help her plan a marketing strategy for the project. At first, I thought it would be a good opportunity to maybe influence it in a more eco-friendly direction. However, as we started discussing ideas, it became clear that she is fully committed to the concept of promoting single-use plastics, and my suggestions for more sustainable alternatives were met with resistance.

I really want to support Sarah, but I feel uncomfortable about being involved in a project that directly contradicts my values. Sarah has a very tight deadline and is struggling with this project, and if I refuse to help, she might have to scramble to find someone else, which could create more stress for her.

**Why I might be an asshole:**

* · I have the skills and knowledge to help her create a successful campaign, and my refusal might leave her in a tough spot.
* · I could be seen as abandoning a friend in need, especially since I have the capacity to lend a hand.
* · It might look like I'm prioritizing my ideals over our friendship, which could hurt her feelings.

**Why I don’t think I’m an asshole:**

* · My beliefs about sustainability and the harmful effects of single-use plastics are longstanding and deeply rooted. Being involved in promoting something I believe to be damaging feels wrong.
* · I’ve expressed my concerns to Sarah, and she’s made it clear that she’s not open to considering other options. So, my involvement wouldn’t lead to any positive change.
* · I think it’s important to stand by one’s principles, even when it risks causing a rift in a friendship. I’m not judging her decisions; I just can’t support something that goes against my values.

So, WIBTA for not helping Sarah with this project?",234,2847,0.61,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_67121,2018-08-24 00:00:00,NAH,2284,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I'm a 35F and I've been married to my husband, 36M, for seven years. We have two kids: a 5-year-old son and a 3-year-old daughter. My husband has a younger sister, 25F, who has been living with us since she graduated college about a year ago. She’s trying to find a full-time job and is still adjusting to adult life.

Recently, she mentioned wanting to go on a weekend trip with some friends. Initially, I said it would be fine as long as she could find someone to watch the kids while she was gone. She seemed hesitant about asking her friends to take care of our kids, and I encouraged her to look into it more. After a few days, she came back and said she couldn't find anyone who'd be able to help out, and I suggested that maybe I could help her find a babysitter.

However, my husband felt that since she is an adult, she should be responsible for arranging her own childcare for the trip, rather than leaning on us. I didn’t want to outright say no to her because I felt guilty about her not getting the chance to unwind and have a social life, especially after the stress of finding a job.

After some discussions, we decided together that we would take care of the kids for the weekend if she really needed to go. She seemed relieved and excited to go. However, I could sense that my husband was still a bit frustrated about it, and I worried that this might create some tension.

The weekend of her trip arrived, and everything went smoothly. She had a great time, but it did take a lot of energy for both of us to manage the kids alone while she was gone. When she returned, my husband expressed his annoyance at having to help when he thought it was solely her responsibility. I tried to explain that I wanted to support her too, because she’s family and it’s tough starting out in adult life.

Now there's a bit of an awkwardness between my husband and sister-in-law. I can see both sides: my husband wants to set boundaries, while I want to be supportive of family. I'm feeling conflicted, and I wonder if I should have taken a firmer stance to avoid this tension.

As we settled down with popcorn, I noticed he kept checking his phone. I didn’t think much of it at first, but after a while, he started commenting on things that were happening in the movie, which I found distracting. At one point, he even started quoting lines from a different movie! I gently reminded him that we were watching “Casablanca,” and he laughed it off, saying he was just trying to be funny.

After a while, I felt frustrated and told him, “Can we just focus on the movie? I want you to really enjoy it.” He seemed a bit taken aback and said he was just trying to lighten the mood. I realized he didn't mean any harm, but I also felt that I needed to express my wishes for a more immersive experience.

By the end of the night, we both seemed a little off. I wasn’t sure if I had been too harsh, and he later texted me saying he felt bad for not being more serious about watching the film. I told him it was okay, that I appreciated his humor, but I just wanted to enjoy a classic together without distractions.

Looking back, I think we both could have handled the situation better. I should have recognized he was trying to have fun, and he could have been more mindful of my desire to enjoy the movie.

He’s been going through a tough time lately because his partner of five years suddenly decided to leave him. Understandably, he’s been feeling down and struggling to cope with the whole situation. I've been trying to be supportive, checking in on him, and offering to hang out.

About a month ago, I invited him to a party I was hosting for my birthday, thinking it would be a good distraction for him. Dave initially said he would come, but the day of the party, he texted me saying he was feeling overwhelmed and would rather not attend. I completely understood and told him to take care of himself.

Fast forward a couple of weeks, I was scrolling through social media and saw that Dave had gone to a party at our mutual friend’s place the same night he skipped mine. I felt a little hurt and confused because it seemed like he didn’t want to be around me but was okay being around others. So, I reached out to him, trying to express my feelings without blaming him. I said something like, ""Hey, I noticed you were at that party a few weeks ago. I hope you had fun, but I have to admit I felt a bit disappointed you didn’t come to mine.""

Dave responded and apologized, explaining that he wasn't ready to be in a social setting with people from our wider friend group, but felt more comfortable with that smaller circle. He reassured me it wasn't personal and that he appreciated my understanding nature. We talked it out, and I realized that he was just trying to take care of his mental health in the way that worked best for him.

A couple of weeks ago, Jamie invited me to a concert of a band we both like. I was excited and agreed right away. The day of the concert, Jamie texted me that she wasn’t feeling well and didn’t want to go. I understood and told her it was fine, and that we could go to another concert later.

A few hours later, I saw her posting on social media at the concert with other friends. Naturally, I felt hurt and a bit betrayed that she had canceled on me but still went out with others. When I confronted her about it, she explained that she had initially thought she was too sick to go, but then she felt better and her other friends convinced her to join.

I was frustrated, and I told her that it felt like she didn’t value our friendship enough to be upfront about her plans. I let her know it would have been nice to at least get a heads up that she was feeling better, instead of finding out through social media. Jamie apologized and said she didn’t mean to hurt me, but she also felt like she was being pushed into a corner because I was upset.

I had been feeling overwhelmed with work and hadn’t had time to do my share of the chores, but I also noticed that my roommates were not stepping up to help either.

So, I expressed my feelings to them during our weekly house meeting. I said that it’s frustrating to feel like I'm the only one putting in the effort, and I suggested that we either need to stick to the schedule better or find a new way to manage our chores.

Jamie and I had been best friends since childhood, and Alex had recently joined our friend group. They both started dating, and while I was thrilled for them, I could sense some tension brewing.

One evening, we all went out for dinner, and things were going smoothly until Jamie, after a few drinks, started playfully teasing Alex about his cooking skills. Alex, however, took it a bit too personally and snapped back, which led to Jamie feeling hurt. I could see the atmosphere shift, and it was clear that the playful banter had crossed a line for both of them.

Trying to lighten the mood, I made a joke about how neither of them should cook for me, and that I’d be better off ordering takeout. It got a small laugh from the others, but it did nothing to ease the tension between Jamie and Alex. Eventually, after dinner, they had a blow-up argument outside the restaurant, and I felt caught in the middle. I cared about both of them but didn't want to pick sides.

After the night ended, I reached out to both of them separately. I told Jamie I thought she might have gone a bit far with her teasing, and I advised Alex to be more understanding of Jamie's sense of humor. They both appreciated that I was trying to help but were frustrated that I hadn't directly intervened when the argument started. 

Now, some of my other friends think I should've stepped in during the argument instead of just talking to them later.

A few days ago, I was at the park with my dog, just enjoying the fresh air and letting him play. While I was sitting on a bench, I noticed a group of kids playing soccer nearby. They seemed to be having a great time, but I also noticed that one of the boys was sitting alone on the sidelines, looking pretty sad while the others were playing. 

I ended up walking over to him and asked if he wanted to join the game. He looked surprised but then smiled and said he’d like to. I introduced myself and took a moment to chat with him.

When I got home, I told some friends about the experience, and while most thought it was sweet, one of them said I shouldn’t have been talking to kids I didn’t know and that it was kind of weird.

In the spirit of community, I agreed and decided to put a few extra pastries on a separate table labeled ""Kid-Friendly Treats"" so that the kids had options. I also took the time to ensure that there were some milder dishes available for everyone.

Later, my neighbor who brought the chili overheard the conversation and seemed upset that his dish was being segregated. He told me that he felt like I was undermining his cooking and that everyone should just try it without restrictions. I explained that I wanted everyone, especially the kids, to feel included and have something they could enjoy.

In the end, there were no hard feelings, and the potluck turned out to be a great success. However, I can’t help but wonder if I should have just let everyone try the chili as it was, or if my approach to make it more inclusive was the right call. Am I the asshole for prioritizing the kids’ preferences over my neighbor’s dish?",122,2629,0.71,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_16804,2024-08-08 00:00:00,NAH,1971,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I recently had a disagreement with my best friend over a group vacation we were planning. We’ve been friends for years, and we were really excited to go on this trip together. We had a group chat with a few other friends to discuss details. 

One day, my friend brought up the idea of staying at a more luxurious hotel instead of the budget option we originally discussed. She argued that since we were all working hard and deserved a nice getaway, we should splurge a little. I completely understood her perspective, but I felt that not everyone in our group could comfortably afford the upgrade, and I didn’t want anyone to feel pressured into spending more than they could handle.

I suggested that we stick to the original plan and have fun without overstretching our budgets. My friend got upset and accused me of being too practical and not wanting to enjoy life. I tried to explain that I just wanted everyone to feel included and comfortable. The conversation got a bit heated, and I felt bad because I didn’t want to hurt her feelings.

In the end, we reached a compromise where we would book the budget hotel but also plan some splurge activities, like a nice dinner out. It worked out, and everyone seemed happy with the decision, but I still felt conflicted about how it all went down. I love my friend and didn’t mean to upset her, but I also stand by wanting to look out for the whole group.

No one is the Asshole,"I live in a shared house with three other roommates, and we’ve all been living together for about six months. We get along well and have established a pretty chill and open atmosphere. Most of our evenings are spent hanging out, watching movies, or playing games. However, one of my roommates, Amy, recently started bringing home her new boyfriend, Jake, quite frequently.

At first, it was fine, and we welcomed him into our space. But over time, I started feeling uncomfortable because Jake is very loud and tends to dominate conversations. He also has a habit of leaving his things in common areas, which makes the house feel cluttered. I tried to bring this up casually during one of our house meetings, mentioning that I felt overwhelmed by the noise and the mess. I suggested that we could work on making the shared spaces more comfortable for everyone.

However, my comment seemed to upset Amy, as she felt I was criticizing her choice in partners. I assured her it wasn’t personal and that I genuinely appreciated her as a friend. But she said she felt like I was trying to control her social life. I apologized for how it came off, but I also expressed that it was important for me to feel comfortable in my own home.

After that conversation, things got a bit tense between us, and I felt bad for upsetting her. I really just wanted to find a solution that felt fair for everyone. I’ve since tried to keep my distance and allow her to spend time with Jake without interference, but I still find myself feeling frustrated at times.

I spent weeks organizing everything—inviting friends and family, booking a venue, and arranging food and drinks. The day before the party, my partner's best friend reached out to me, expressing her concern that my partner might not be as excited about a big gathering as I thought. She mentioned that my partner had been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately and might prefer a low-key celebration instead.

I was torn. On one hand, I wanted to stick to my original plan because I thought my partner would love the surprise. On the other hand, I didn’t want to put them in a situation that could make them uncomfortable. I decided to reach out to my partner and asked if they would prefer a smaller celebration, letting them know that I had other plans in mind if they wanted something different. To my relief, my partner appreciated the consideration and said they would love a more intimate gathering with just a few close friends.

In the end, I switched the venue and kept it low-key, which made my partner happy. I felt a little disappointed that I couldn't execute my initial grand idea, but seeing my partner enjoy the day made it worth it.

However, my friend started pushing me to follow a strict diet and workout regimen that she had found online. I appreciated her enthusiasm but felt overwhelmed. I prefer a more balanced approach to fitness that allows for some flexibility and treats. I tried to explain this to her, but she insisted that my way was “too lenient” and that I needed to be more disciplined to see results.

I (29F) have a close friend, Sarah (28F), who I’ve known since college. We’ve always supported each other, but recently, her financial situation has become a point of contention between us. Sarah has a decent job, but she tends to spend her money impulsively on things she doesn’t need, like designer clothes and fancy dinners. She often borrows money from me and other friends to cover her bills, claiming she’ll pay us back next month.

Over the past year, I’ve lent her several hundred dollars, which she has yet to repay. I’m not wealthy, and it’s starting to affect my own budgeting. I’ve tried to talk to her about being more responsible with her finances, suggesting she create a budget or even take a personal finance class. She gets upset and insists that I’m judging her and that it’s her money to spend as she pleases.

I care about her and want to see her succeed, but I feel like my attempts to help are falling on deaf ears. Recently, she asked to borrow $200 again for a weekend trip she wants to take with friends. I told her I couldn’t lend her any more money and that I think she needs to start taking her finances seriously. She got really upset and accused me of being unsupportive.

I recently found myself in a bit of a family dilemma. My sister, who is 30, just had her first baby, and the whole family is understandably excited. We’ve all been rallying around her to support her in this new journey. However, I noticed that my sister was becoming overwhelmed with visitors and advice from everyone, and it was beginning to stress her out.

I have always been very close to my sister, and I wanted to help her through this transition in a way that suits her best. I reached out to her and asked if she would prefer a quieter approach to visitors, or if she wanted me to help manage the influx of family wanting to drop by. I thought this was a considerate move, as I could tell she was feeling a bit anxious about hosting so many people.

To my surprise, she appreciated the offer but expressed that she felt it was important for her to spend time with everyone, even if it was overwhelming. I totally understood that and assured her that I would help as best as I could. However, during one particular weekend, I noticed that she was struggling to keep up with all the visitors and was starting to feel burnt out. I decided to take it upon myself to send a group message to our extended family, asking them to space out their visits over the next few weeks to give her some breathing room.

My sister saw the message and was initially upset. She felt that I overstepped by trying to control the situation and that she was capable of managing it herself. I explained my intention was to help her, but it turned into a bit of a disagreement. We eventually talked it through and came to an understanding, but I still felt bad for having unintentionally upset her.

My partner’s sister recently had a baby, and she’s been sharing a lot of photos and updates on social media. I’m genuinely happy for her, but I have to admit that I’m a little overwhelmed by how much she’s posting. It’s almost every day, and some of the photos are very similar. 

I don’t want to seem unsupportive, but I’ve started to feel like my own social media feed is flooded with baby pictures, and I’m having a hard time finding interest in them. I realized this was affecting my mood, so I decided to mute her posts on social media. I thought this was a harmless way to manage my feelings without hurting anyone.

A few days later, my partner noticed that I hadn’t liked or commented on any of the baby pictures. When I explained the situation and my decision to mute her posts, my partner was taken aback. They felt that I should be more supportive and that muting her was a passive way of showing disinterest. I explained that I still love their sister and the baby; I just needed a little break from the constant updates. 

We had a long conversation about it. My partner was upset but also understood where I was coming from. They suggested I could just unfollow the posts instead of muting her, but I felt that muting was a more private way to deal with my feelings. We ultimately agreed to just let it go for now and revisit it if needed.

One of our friends, Alex, is known for being a little competitive, especially when it comes to board games. I enjoy a bit of competition too, but I also love keeping the atmosphere light and fun. We agreed on a new game that none of us had played before, which added an extra layer of excitement.

During the game, Alex was really invested in winning, which started to create a bit of tension. We had some friendly banter, and I joked that winning didn’t matter as much as having a good time. However, Alex took my comments the wrong way and seemed to get more frustrated with every round. I tried to lighten the mood with a few playful comments, but it only seemed to escalate things.

After that, the atmosphere felt tense. I could see that Alex was genuinely annoyed, and I felt bad because I didn’t want to ruin the night. We finished the game, and I decided to talk to Alex privately afterward to apologize for any misunderstanding and to make sure there were no hard feelings.

I said something like, ""I didn’t mean to upset you with my jokes; I just wanted us all to have a great time. I appreciate your competitive spirit, but I hope you know I value our friendship more than any game."" Alex admitted that they had let the game get to them more than they should have and appreciated my willingness to talk it out.

They thought it would be better for him to be in a stable environment, and since we had space, we agreed.

At first, I was excited about having him around. I thought it would be fun to bond and maybe even help him out with schoolwork. But I quickly realized that my boyfriend’s brother is not the easiest person to live with. He’s a very typical teenager; he often leaves his stuff all over the place, doesn’t clean up after himself, and can be quite disrespectful.

I sat down with him to talk about it, trying to be supportive, but he ended up yelling at me and saying I’m not his parent.

A few weeks ago, I (28f) was invited to my friend’s (30m) wedding. Let’s call him Mike. Mike and I have known each other for years and have always gotten along well. He’s getting married to someone I don’t know very well, but I was really looking forward to celebrating with him. However, a few days before the wedding, I got a text from Mike asking if I could give a speech at the reception. He said he wanted something personal and heartfelt, and I felt honored that he’d ask me.

I spent a lot of time thinking about what to say. I wanted to make it special but also knew that public speaking isn't my strong suit. On the day of the wedding, I was really nervous but excited. The ceremony was beautiful, and when it came time for the reception, I stood up to give my speech.

I started by sharing some memories about Mike and what a great friend he’s been to me. As I spoke, I noticed that Mike’s fiancée (let's call her Sarah) seemed a bit uncomfortable. I thought I was just being paranoid, but I carried on. I ended the speech on a positive note, wishing them both love and happiness.

After the speech, Sarah approached me and thanked me, but she looked a bit strained. It turned out that she wasn’t thrilled with the focus on Mike’s past rather than the two of them as a couple. From her perspective, she felt overshadowed by the stories I told about Mike, and it made her feel like she was just an accessory in the celebration rather than a spotlight.

I didn’t mean to upset her, but I also felt like I was just sharing my friendship with Mike. I talked to Mike the next day, and while he appreciated my speech, he acknowledged that Sarah had some valid points about wanting the day to be more about them as a couple.

I was a bit concerned because my budget was already stretched thin, and I had been trying to save up for some upcoming bills.

I brought up my concerns with my friend, suggesting that we look for more budget-friendly options. I mentioned that while I’m excited for the trip, I didn’t want to end up feeling financially strained afterwards. My friend seemed disappointed and said they were really looking forward to these activities and felt like I was trying to hold them back from having fun.

We both got a bit frustrated and had a back-and-forth about how to balance our plans. In the end, we found a compromise where we decided to go for one nice dinner but keep the other activities more affordable. I felt bad for initially pushing back too hard, but I didn’t want to appear ungrateful for the trip or ruin the experience for my friend.

No one is the Asshole,"A few months ago, I was at a friend’s housewarming party. It was a great gathering with lots of people I knew and some I didn’t. One person I hadn’t met before was a guy named Tom. He seemed nice enough, but he quickly got a bit too comfortable when he started sharing some very personal stories about his life. 

The more he talked, the more I realized he had some pretty extreme views on a lot of things—politics, relationships, and social issues. I found myself feeling increasingly uncomfortable, as he began to dominate the conversation and express opinions that were quite offensive. At one point, he made a joke that I found incredibly inappropriate, and I couldn't help but speak up. I told him that I thought his joke crossed a line and that it wasn't funny at all.

Tom didn’t take it well. He became defensive and insisted that I was being overly sensitive. I could feel the tension rising, and before I knew it, we were engaged in a back-and-forth that left the surrounding guests awkwardly silent. Eventually, I just walked away from the conversation because I didn’t want to escalate things further.

Later, some friends approached me and told me that I was being too harsh on Tom, while others said I did the right thing by calling him out. I honestly didn’t mean to make a scene; I just felt the need to stand up for what I believed was right.

The night ended with Tom sulking in the corner, and I felt bad that my reaction had ruined the mood for everyone, including myself. I don’t think I was an asshole for speaking out, but I also didn’t want to ruin the party for everyone else. 

I reached out to Tom the next day to apologize if I had come off too strong, but I also reiterated that I stand by my beliefs. He seemed to understand, but it was clear that we wouldn’t be having any more deep conversations.

When we moved in together, we decided to split all our expenses equally, which worked for a while. However, my partner recently lost their job, and although they’re actively looking for work, they’re understandably stressed about finances. I’ve been supportive and encouraged them to take their time to find a job that’s a good fit rather than rushing into something they might not like.

To help alleviate some of the financial pressure, I suggested we adjust our living expenses temporarily. I offered to cover a larger portion of the rent and bills while they looked for work. My partner appreciated the gesture at first, but then they became upset, feeling that me offering more support implied they were incapable of contributing equally.

We had a long conversation about it, and I explained that I wanted to help, not take away their autonomy or make them feel less valued. But my partner felt like the situation was unfair, and that it might create a power imbalance in our relationship.

Ultimately, we decided to keep our original arrangement for now, but it’s been a bit tense as we both navigate this situation. We both care for each other deeply, and we’re trying to communicate openly, but it’s tough.

No one is the Asshole,"My best friend, Sarah, is pregnant and due in a few months. She's been really open about her struggles with anxiety and depression throughout her pregnancy, and I admire her for being so candid. She's been seeing a therapist and trying to take care of herself as best as she can, but some days are definitely harder than others.

Recently, she decided to have a small baby shower at her house and invited a handful of close friends and family. I was excited to help her with the planning since I love throwing parties. As we discussed details, I offered to help with decorations, food, and organizing games. Sarah appreciated the help and we started making plans together.

A couple of weeks before the shower, Sarah mentioned her sister, Emily, who has been struggling with her own issues, including addiction. Emily has been in and out of rehab for several years and their relationship has been strained. Sarah expressed concern about inviting Emily to the shower, knowing that it might be a trigger for her, but she also didn’t want to exclude her.

I suggested that maybe it would be better for Sarah to have the shower without Emily, considering how much stress Sarah was already under. I didn't want to put pressure on Sarah, but I felt that if Emily came, it could lead to a lot of chaos and take away from what should be a happy occasion for Sarah. Sarah was torn; she felt guilty for even thinking about not inviting her sister, but she also recognized that her mental health needed to come first.

After a lot of discussion, Sarah ultimately decided to invite Emily but set some firm boundaries. She made it clear that if Emily was under the influence or caused any disruption, she would have to leave. I supported Sarah's decision, though I was still a bit nervous about how it would play out.

The day of the shower came, and Emily did show up. Initially, things were going well, but about halfway through the event, it became evident that she was using and it started to affect her behavior. It was uncomfortable, and Sarah had to calmly ask her to leave, which was hard for both of them.

Afterward, I talked to Sarah about how everything unfolded. She felt conflicted about having invited Emily and was worried that she had made the wrong choice. I reassured her that she had done her best to be inclusive while also protecting her own well-being. I told her that it was okay to prioritize her mental health, especially during such a vulnerable time in her life.

TL;DR: My best friend is having a baby shower and is unsure whether to invite her sister who struggles with addiction. I suggested it might be better not to invite her for the sake of Sarah's mental health. In the end, Sarah invited her sister, but it led to an uncomfortable situation that left her feeling conflicted about her decision.",646,2454,0.62,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_51396,2022-12-28 00:00:00,NAH,2817,AITA

I made a large gluten-free and dairy-free cake for Sarah, along with some other snacks that fit her dietary restrictions.

The other guests seemed happy with what I provided, but it turned into a bit of an awkward situation.

Then, a few days before the party, she posted on social media that she was going to have a small gathering instead, due to some last-minute changes. I didn’t think much of it; I just assumed the dinner was still happening, but maybe in a more casual way.

When I arrived at the party, I was surprised to see that it was a very small gathering, and the atmosphere felt quite relaxed. Everyone was just hanging out and there was no fancy dinner or cake, only snacks. I felt a bit out of place with my gift, but I decided to give it to her anyway.

When I presented the bracelet, she looked a bit taken aback. She thanked me, but I could tell she felt awkward about it. Later, she pulled me aside and told me that she really appreciated the thought, but that she was trying to keep things low-key and didn’t expect gifts. I felt terrible and apologized, saying that I didn’t realize the vibe had changed.

Now I’m left feeling unsure if I overstepped by bringing a gift when she explicitly wanted a simple gathering. I didn’t mean to make her uncomfortable, and I genuinely wanted to celebrate her. Was I in the wrong here?",275,887,0.98,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_63750,2024-05-31 00:00:00,NAH,1596,AITA

I love my sister, but weddings have always made me anxious. The large gatherings, the socializing, and the pressure to dress up and act a certain way really stress me out.

I thought maybe I could help with decorations or organizing some of the pre-wedding events, which might make me feel more comfortable. But she feels strongly about having her family there, and it’s important to her that I attend.

My partner thinks I should just go and support my sister, even if it makes me uncomfortable, because it's a once-in-a-lifetime event. I’m torn because I don’t want to hurt her feelings, but I also don’t want to put myself in a situation that I know will cause me a lot of anxiety.

No one is the Asshole,"Hello Reddit! First time posting here, so please bear with me!

I am a single mother of a 15-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter. Recently, they both started showing an interest in cooking, which I think is fantastic! They’ve been watching cooking shows and asking to try out recipes. I love that they want to learn, but here’s the thing: my son has become very passionate about it and has taken over the kitchen a bit too much.

He started experimenting with recipes without checking with me first, and while some of the meals have been great, there have been a few disastrous attempts too. One night, he tried making a fancy pasta dish and ended up burning it, which filled the house with smoke. I had to step in and open windows, and it took a while to air everything out. 

After that incident, I talked to him about the importance of safety in the kitchen and the need to communicate when he’s trying something new. He got really upset, saying I was undermining his cooking journey and that I didn’t appreciate his efforts. I didn’t mean to hurt his feelings; I just wanted to ensure that cooking remains fun and safe for him and his sister.

I also pointed out that it would be better if we worked more as a team in the kitchen instead of him going solo all the time. He thinks I’m being too controlling, while I just want to keep a good balance and ensure everything is safe.

AITA for wanting to set some boundaries while they explore their new interests? 

Edit1: Just to clarify:
- I absolutely encourage them to cook and learn, and I think it’s great they’re taking an interest.
- I never intended to discourage him; I just wanted to establish some safety guidelines.
- My daughter is also interested in cooking, and I want to make sure they can both feel involved without any mishaps.
- I really appreciate their creativity, and I want to support that while also keeping the kitchen safe and manageable.",858,1485,0.84,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_84487,2018-07-09 00:00:00,NAH,1919,AITA

But then she mentioned that she felt bad I did all the work and implied that I shouldn't have cleaned without discussing it with her first. I tried to explain that I just wanted to help out and that it had been bothering me, but she felt I was overstepping by not waiting for her to contribute.

So, I suggested we switch to a different activity that involved everyone more equally. The group agreed, and we ended up playing a team-based game instead which everyone enjoyed, including Mark.

We ended up having a friendly discussion about boundaries and the importance of communication, especially since we’re living together. I assured her I appreciated her efforts in making the home inviting, but I’d like to keep my belongings in my space unless we discuss it first.

Now, I’m worried that I may have come off as ungrateful or too attached to a plant. I don’t want to create tension in our living situation, but I also want to feel comfortable in my space.

No one is the Asshole,"I (27/F) recently moved in with my boyfriend (30/M) after dating for about two years. We both come from different financial backgrounds—he grew up in a family that prioritized saving and living frugally, while my family never really discussed money and I often found myself spending impulsively. 

Before moving in, we had several discussions about finances and how we would manage expenses together. He expressed his desire for us to have a budget and stick to it, which I agreed to, hoping it would help me be more responsible. 

A few weeks after moving in, I accidentally overspent on groceries one week and was feeling really down about it. I confessed to my boyfriend, and instead of being upset, he was understanding. He suggested we sit down and review our budget together. However, during our discussion, he pointed out that I tend to overspend in certain areas, which made me feel defensive. I thought we were working together to manage our finances, not just him critiquing my habits.

During the conversation, I mentioned that I felt pressured by his very strict budgeting approach, and he seemed surprised. He thought I was on board with the idea of saving and budgeting, and I realized that maybe I hadn’t communicated my feelings effectively. 

After some back and forth, we agreed to find a middle ground. He promised to be less rigid with his expectations, and I committed to being more mindful of my spending. We even created a fun way to track our discretionary spending together, turning it into a little challenge rather than a chore. 

Now, I feel like we're on the same team, and while we both had moments where we felt frustrated, I think it was just a misunderstanding of each other's perspectives. 

Am I the Asshole for not initially being clear about my feelings on budgeting, or was he out of line for being too strict with our finances? Or are we both just learning how to communicate better?",46,597,0.7,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_88311,2019-12-06 00:00:00,NAH,1922,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I was at the park on a Saturday afternoon, enjoying some fresh air and reading a book. It was a beautiful day, and there were lots of families around. As I was absorbed in my reading, I noticed a little boy, maybe around five or six years old, playing with a soccer ball nearby. He was having a great time kicking it around.

Suddenly, the ball rolled towards me and came to a stop at my feet. The boy ran over, looking a bit shy but eager to get his ball back. I picked it up and smiled at him, saying, ""Here you go, buddy!"" Just as I was about to hand it to him, he said, ""Can you kick it back to me?"" 

I thought it would be fun, so I took a few steps back, lined up, and gave the ball a good kick. It soared across the grass, heading straight for him, and he squealed in delight. However, I didn’t realize how hard I had kicked it, and it ended up flying past him and crashing into a nearby picnic table, knocking over a couple of drinks and scattering food everywhere.

Instantly, I felt terrible and rushed over to help. The boy's parents were understandably upset, but I apologized profusely and offered to help clean up. I even offered to buy them refreshments to replace what had been spilled. They appreciated the gesture, and we ended up chatting for a bit while cleaning up the mess.

After everything was sorted out, we all laughed it off, and the parents assured me that it was just an accident. The little boy gave me a high-five for kicking the ball, and I left the park feeling relieved but still a bit shaken by the incident.

I hope I handled it well in the end, but I still feel guilty about the initial mishap.

No one is the Asshole,"I’ve been grappling with a situation that happened at work, and I’m hoping to get some perspective on it. 

A couple of weeks ago, my coworker, Tom, brought in some homemade cookies to share with the team. I absolutely love cookies and was really looking forward to trying them. When I went to grab one, I noticed that he didn’t specify any allergens, and I’m allergic to nuts. I asked him if they contained nuts, and he confidently said no. 

After I took a cookie, I saw another coworker, Sarah, looking hesitant. I asked her if she was okay, and she mentioned she also had a nut allergy but had eaten one of the cookies already because she thought they were safe. 

Tom seemed surprised, insisting he had checked all the ingredients and that there were definitely no nuts involved. However, after a brief discussion, we both realized he had used a mixed nut butter in the cookies without thinking to label it. 

I felt really bad for Sarah, who was now feeling unwell, and I talked to Tom about how important it is to label food brought into the office, especially when it comes to allergens. Tom apologized and said he’d be more careful in the future, but I also suggested we have a rule going forward to label any homemade snacks we bring in.

I’m wondering if I overstepped by bringing this up with Tom. I didn’t want to make him feel bad, but I thought it was important for everyone’s safety.

However, she's been quite vocal on social media about her experiences and the challenges she faces, often sharing personal stories about the animals she's working with.

I noticed that she posted about a specific dog that had been rescued and was looking for a forever home. She used the dog's story to highlight the importance of adopting pets rather than buying them. While I totally support her message, I felt that some of her posts were a bit too emotional, and I worried that they might be discouraging potential adopters who could see them as overly dramatic.

I mentioned this to her in a private message, suggesting that while her passion is admirable, she might want to focus more on the positives and successes, rather than the heart-wrenching stories that could scare people away from adoption. She responded that she appreciated my concern but felt that sharing the realities of shelter life was necessary to raise awareness.

I didn't mean to upset her, but I also wanted to express my perspective. Now I'm wondering if I was out of line for suggesting she change her approach, or if it was valid feedback.

After a couple of weeks, he invited me to a gathering at his place with some of his friends, and I was thrilled to go.

At the gathering, I was introduced to everyone and really enjoyed myself. As the night went on, I noticed that one of the friends (27/F) seemed a bit off. She was sitting alone while everyone else was chatting and laughing, so I decided to include her in the conversation.

I asked her about her interests, and we started talking about books. She shared that she loved reading but felt like no one else in the group was interested in the same genres. I could tell she was a bit shy but genuinely appreciated the attention. I encouraged her to share her favorite books, and the other friends joined in, asking questions and engaging with her. 

After a while, I noticed that the mood shifted slightly. The hostess, who had been super welcoming, suddenly seemed annoyed. I later found out from my coworker that she didn't like how I was trying to pull attention away from the group and that she had been working hard to keep the conversation lively. I didn’t mean to overshadow anyone; I just wanted to help someone feel included.

I felt really bad because I didn't intend to make anyone uncomfortable. My coworker reassured me that it wasn’t a huge deal, but I still felt like I might have crossed a line. The girl I was talking to thanked me afterward for including her, but I could tell that I might have unintentionally caused some tension.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently organized a small reunion for our college friend group since we haven't all been together in years. We planned it for a Saturday afternoon at a local park where we could enjoy the nice weather, have some food, and catch up. Everyone was excited, and I sent out a group message to gauge interest and finalize the details.

One of my friends, Sarah, mentioned that she would love to come but would need to bring her dog, as she doesn't have anyone to watch him. I thought it was a great idea, as many of us are dog lovers, and it would be fun to have him there. I told her it was totally fine, and I made sure to let everyone know that there would be a dog at the reunion.

As the day approached, I started to feel a bit concerned about having a dog in a public space, especially since some of our friends have allergies and not everyone is comfortable around pets. I reached out to Sarah privately and expressed my concerns, suggesting that maybe it would be better for her to leave the dog at home this time, especially since some of our friends might not enjoy the dog being around.

Sarah was understandably hurt by my suggestion. She felt that it was unfair for her to have to choose between attending the reunion and bringing her dog, as she didn't have many opportunities to socialize with both her friends and her pet. I realized that she had a point and that it was important for her to feel included.

Eventually, we decided to go ahead with the reunion as planned but made sure to create a space where the dog could stay away from those who might be allergic or uncomfortable. We also made a point to communicate our boundaries regarding the dog to ensure everyone felt safe and included.

Looking back, I feel like everyone was trying to do their best to include each other, but it did lead to a bit of tension. I wonder if I handled it well or if I came off as inconsiderate.

No one is the Asshole,"I (30F) have a close friend, Max (30M), who I've known for over a decade. We both love hiking and have made it a tradition to go on a big hiking trip every year. This year, we decided to hike a popular trail that’s known for its stunning views and challenging terrain.

Leading up to the trip, Max was really excited and started talking about how he wanted to push himself to complete the entire trail in two days, camping overnight. I, on the other hand, have been dealing with some health issues that have made me less physically active lately. I was looking forward to the trip, but I knew I wouldn't be able to keep up with the ambitious plan Max had in mind.

A few days before the trip, I had a conversation with Max where I expressed my concerns. I told him I was worried I wouldn’t be able to handle the strenuous pace and suggested we could take our time and enjoy the hike, maybe even do it over three days instead. Max was disappointed but ultimately agreed, saying he just wanted to spend time with me regardless.

When we started the hike, it quickly became clear that I was struggling more than I anticipated. I was falling behind, and Max, who was eager to complete the trail in two days, started to get frustrated. He kept encouraging me to push harder, and I could see he felt held back by my pace. I felt bad for slowing him down, but I was also trying my best to keep up without overexerting myself.

By the end of the first day, we had only covered half the distance Max wanted to. He was visibly upset and told me he felt like we weren’t making the most of our trip. I tried to explain that I was doing my best given my current condition, but he said he was hoping for a different experience and that he wanted to reach the summit in time to see the sunrise.

Feeling stuck, I suggested we split up for the next day: he could go ahead and complete the hike as planned, and I could take my time and meet him at the campsite later. He hesitated but eventually agreed, saying he didn’t want to ruin my experience. We parted ways the next morning, and I took a more leisurely route.

When we met up later, Max was happy he completed the hike but seemed conflicted about how things went down. We had a long talk about it that evening, and while we both acknowledged the situation wasn’t ideal, we agreed that we still valued our friendship and the time spent together, even if it wasn’t what we had originally envisioned.

To help with this, I decided to start meal prepping on Sundays to save time during the week. I mentioned this to my partner, who was supportive but expressed a concern that it might take away from our time together. He suggested that maybe I could just prepare simpler meals instead.

I appreciated his concern but explained that meal prepping would actually give us more time together during the week since I wouldn’t be scrambling to cook each evening. I asked if he could help me with the prep, so we could make it a fun activity. However, he seemed hesitant and said he’d rather spend that time relaxing together instead.

After a bit of back and forth, we reached a compromise where I would prep meals for lunches and dinners, but I’d also set aside time for us to relax together on Sundays. I felt good about the arrangement, but I noticed he still seemed a little frustrated about it.

Our neighbors have a cat named Whiskers who loves to roam around the building and is quite friendly. One day, I was coming back from work and saw Whiskers sitting in the hallway. I thought he looked a bit lost, so I picked him up and went to knock on my neighbor's door to return him. To my surprise, the door swung open to reveal them hosting a small gathering. 

Realizing the situation, I tried to explain, but instead, I ended up making it sound like I was complaining about their cat being out. I said something like, ""I just found Whiskers in the hall, he shouldn't be roaming around like that!"" They looked at me a bit taken aback, and I realized my tone was a bit off. It felt like I was scolding them rather than just returning their pet.

They laughed it off and assured me that Whiskers is free to roam as he pleases, but I could tell I made them feel a little uncomfortable. I apologized for coming off too harshly and explained that I just wanted to make sure he was safe. They accepted my apology, and we all ended up laughing about it after a few moments.

Later on, I felt bad for how I handled the situation and decided to bake some cookies as a peace offering. I brought them over and made sure to express how much I appreciate having them as neighbors. They loved the cookies and thanked me for being thoughtful.

However, I've noticed that his focus on fitness sometimes leads him to make comments about my own lifestyle choices, particularly around food and exercise.

I’ve been trying to maintain a healthy balance in my life, but I also enjoy indulging in my favorite foods and sometimes skip workouts. Recently, he made a comment during dinner about how I should really consider cutting back on carbs if I wanted to feel better and be more energetic. I understand he means well, but his comments often come off as judgmental rather than supportive.

After a few instances like this, I finally expressed how his comments made me feel. I told him that while I appreciate his intentions, they sometimes feel like pressure rather than encouragement. He seemed genuinely surprised and apologized, saying he just wants the best for me and thought I could benefit from his perspective.

Now, I find myself wondering if I overreacted. I know he cares about my well-being, but I also wish he could be more sensitive to my feelings and choices. It’s a tricky situation because I understand where he’s coming from, but I also don’t want to feel judged or pressured in my relationship.

So, am I being unreasonable for feeling this way, or should I be more understanding of his intentions?",201,2312,0.51,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_46339,2019-05-20 00:00:00,NAH,1486,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I work as a teacher at a local middle school. A few weeks ago, I was chatting with a colleague during lunch about our students and how challenging some of them can be. We started discussing how we both have a couple of students who struggle with their grades, and I mentioned a particular student who has been having a tough time with math. 

This student, let's call her Sarah, has been working hard, but she often gets discouraged quickly. I encouraged my colleague to reach out to her and perhaps offer some extra help after school since my colleague has a great rapport with the kids. 

Fast forward to last week, I decided to stop by the school after hours to pick up some materials I had forgotten. As I was leaving, I noticed my colleague in the classroom with Sarah, working on some math problems. They seemed to be having a productive session, and I was really glad to see it. 

However, as I was walking past, I overheard Sarah expressing how overwhelmed she felt and that she didn’t think she’d ever be good at math. My colleague was trying to reassure her, but I felt compelled to step in. I knocked on the door and, after being invited in, I told Sarah that I believed in her and that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. I shared a personal story about how I struggled with math in school, but with support, I managed to improve. 

Afterward, I left feeling like I might have made a positive impact. However, later that evening, I received a text from my colleague expressing that while they appreciated my support, they were concerned that I might have overstepped by entering their session uninvited. They felt it could have disrupted the flow of their conversation.

I genuinely didn’t mean to intrude, and I thought I was helping. But now I’m wondering if I should have kept my distance and let my colleague handle the situation on their own.

No one is the Asshole,"My friend Mia and I have been close for several years, and we recently started a book club together with a few other friends. We all take turns choosing the book each month, and last month, it was Mia's turn to pick. She chose a novel that I thought was really interesting, but when we had our discussion, it turned out that some of the themes in the book were more controversial than I anticipated.

During our meeting, a few members started to express their discomfort with certain aspects of the book. Mia got defensive, insisting that the themes were important and thought-provoking, and she made some strong arguments in favor of it. I tried to support her but also brought up that it might be beneficial to consider how different perspectives could impact our enjoyment of the book as a group. I suggested that maybe we could pick something lighter for next time to keep everyone engaged.

After the meeting, Mia approached me privately and said she felt like I undermined her choice and that I should have backed her up more, since the book was meaningful to her. I told her I was just trying to facilitate a more inclusive conversation, but it seemed to have made her feel belittled. I didn’t intend to hurt her feelings; it was a tough balancing act between supporting her and addressing the concerns of the others in the group.

Now I’m wondering if I should have just kept my mouth shut and let her have her moment or if I was right to bring up a valid concern.

Sarah mentioned that she was planning a small get-together at her place this Saturday to distract herself and spend time with close friends. I immediately thought it was a great idea, and I wanted to be there to support her. However, I had already promised my cousin that I would attend his engagement party this Saturday, which he planned months in advance and had been looking forward to. My cousin is also very close to me, and I know how much it means to him to have family at his engagement celebration.

I considered attending the party for a little while and then heading over to Sarah’s afterward, but I found out that my cousin's party would be quite far and would likely last well into the night. I realized it would be tough to split my time and that I wouldn’t be able to give my full attention to either event.

I called Sarah and explained my situation. I told her how much I wanted to be there for her but that I had already committed to my cousin’s engagement party. Sarah was really understanding and appreciated my honesty. She said she would be okay and that we could plan to hang out another time when she was feeling better.

I felt torn between wanting to support my friend and honoring my commitment to family. I hope I made the right choice by not trying to juggle both events.

No one is the Asshole,"My (F27) partner (M29) and I have a really close-knit group of friends, and we often hang out on the weekends. We've been doing this for years, and everyone knows each other well. Recently, we decided to have a game night and chose to play some party games, which everyone was excited about.

One of our friends, Alex (M28), is really competitive and tends to take games a bit too seriously, often leading to tension during our game nights. I love Alex and appreciate his enthusiasm, but sometimes it can be overwhelming for others who just want to have fun. I noticed that the last few times we played, he would get really upset if he lost and would make snide comments, which made the atmosphere a bit uncomfortable.

Before game night, I talked to my partner and a couple of other friends about how we could encourage a more relaxed vibe. We agreed to emphasize fun over competition and to remind each other that it's just a game if things got heated.

During game night, everything started off well. We were laughing and joking, and everyone was getting into the spirit. However, when it came time to play a particularly competitive game, I noticed Alex starting to get tense again. As we played, I could see him getting frustrated whenever he made a mistake, which made me worry that he might ruin the fun for everyone.

So, I decided to lighten the mood. I started making silly comments, joking around with the other players, and even pretended to mess up on purpose, which got everyone laughing. I thought this would help Alex relax and enjoy the game more. It worked to some extent, but afterward, he pulled me aside and said he felt like I was undermining the game and his chances of winning. He said that my antics were distracting and made him feel like I was mocking him.

I genuinely didn't mean to hurt his feelings; my intention was to foster a fun environment for everyone. I apologized, and we had a heart-to-heart about how we could balance competitiveness and fun in future game nights. In the end, everyone agreed that we should check in with each other during games to make sure everyone’s having a good time.

No one is the Asshole,"So, my friend group and I are all in our early 20s, and we decided to have a game night last weekend at my place. We had a blast playing board games, eating snacks, and just hanging out. It was one of those evenings where everyone was relaxed and comfortable.

During the night, one of my friends, Jake, who tends to be a bit more socially anxious, seemed to be a little quieter than usual. I noticed he was sitting alone on the couch, and I thought it might help if I sat with him to keep him company. There was plenty of space, but I decided to sit on the armrest next to him instead of taking a spot on the couch.

As we were chatting, I noticed that he was really opening up about some things that have been bothering him lately. I genuinely wanted to support him, so I leaned in a bit closer to make sure he could hear me over the noise of the game—we were all laughing and having fun, but I wanted him to feel included. 

At one point, I accidentally bumped into him while reaching for some chips, and he kind of froze for a second. I realized a moment later that it might have put him in an uncomfortable position, so I quickly pulled back and apologized, saying, “Sorry, I didn’t mean to invade your space!” 

He laughed it off, but I could tell he was still a bit flustered. I tried to lighten the mood by suggesting we both get back to the game and I shifted back to give him more space. The rest of the night went well, but I noticed he seemed a little embarrassed for the rest of the evening.

After everyone left, Jake texted me saying he appreciated me checking in on him and that it meant a lot. He mentioned he felt a bit awkward about what happened when I bumped him, but he understood it was unintentional. I told him there was no reason to feel awkward and that I was just trying to be a good friend.

Now I'm wondering if it was inappropriate for me to lean in like that, even though my intentions were pure. I genuinely wanted to be supportive, but I also don’t want to make him uncomfortable. I feel like everyone handled the situation well, and we both ended up feeling good about the night overall.",636,1786,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_53744,2022-03-09 00:00:00,NAH,2122,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Good Evening Reddit,

I hope you’re all doing well. I’d like to share a situation that recently unfolded in my life and get your thoughts on it.

A few months ago, my best friend Sam unexpectedly lost his father to a long battle with cancer. It was incredibly difficult for him and his family, and I tried my best to support him through the grieving process. One way I wanted to help was by organizing a small fundraiser to raise money for his family’s expenses during this tough time.

I reached out to our friends and managed to collect about $2,000, which we presented to Sam and his family. They were grateful, and it felt good to be able to help them in some small way. However, I later learned that Sam's father had a significant life insurance policy that would cover all of their financial needs. Sam's mother mentioned this when I checked in with her after the fundraiser.

I started to feel conflicted about the fundraiser. While I intended to help, I wondered if it was necessary since they would be financially stable due to the insurance payout. When I brought this up with Sam, he was appreciative of the support and said that the money would help with immediate expenses, regardless of the insurance. 

I just feel a bit uneasy about the whole situation—did I overstep by organizing the fundraiser when they might not have needed it? I never intended to undermine the impact of their father's insurance policy or add to their stress. 

So, AITA for organizing the fundraiser even though I later learned they were going to be fine financially?

Last week, he made a big dinner for his friends, and after they left, the kitchen was a disaster. There were dirty dishes piled up everywhere, food scraps on the counter, and the trash was overflowing. I had a big deadline coming up, so I decided to clean up the kitchen myself during my break. 

When Jake came home, he noticed the kitchen was clean and thanked me, but I could tell he felt a bit awkward. I mentioned that I would appreciate it if he could try to clean up after himself a little more, especially when he cooks for a group. He looked a bit defensive and said that he thought it was fine since we live together and it’s a shared space. 

After talking it over, I realized I might have come off as too harsh. I want him to feel comfortable in our home, but I also need to maintain my own work environment. 

So, I suggested we create a cleaning schedule for shared spaces to avoid any future issues. He agreed, but still seemed a bit put out.

After thinking it over, I decided to have an open discussion with my partner. I expressed my happiness for their opportunity but also shared my concerns about the potential impact on our relationship. I suggested that we could find a balance, where they could take the promotion but also set boundaries on their work hours so that we could still have time for each other.

My partner was receptive to my concerns and appreciated my honesty. They agreed that they didn’t want their promotion to come at the expense of our relationship and said they would talk to their boss about flexible hours and the possibility of working from home a few days a week.

I volunteer at a local animal shelter, which is usually a rewarding experience. One Saturday, we had a big adoption event at a local park, and it was pretty crowded. People were milling about, looking at the animals we had brought, and I was helping out with the dogs.

While I was walking a particularly energetic puppy, I noticed a family nearby. They had two young kids, both of whom were fascinated by the puppy. The kids were tugging at their parents’ sleeves, asking if they could pet him. I could see that the parents were hesitant, likely due to the puppy’s energy.

After the kids expressed their interest a few times, I walked over and asked if they wanted to meet the puppy. I made sure to explain how to approach him and let him sniff them first. The kids were thrilled, and the parents seemed to appreciate the gesture. However, I noticed that the father looked a bit uncomfortable but didn’t say anything.

As the kids were petting the puppy, the dad suddenly said, “I think we should move on. We’re not looking to adopt a pet right now.” I immediately felt embarrassed, as if I had overstepped or made them uncomfortable. I quickly apologized and thanked them for stopping by, but I could tell the dad was a bit irked.

I really just wanted to share the joy of the puppy with them, and I thought it would be a fun experience for the kids. But now I'm wondering if I was wrong to approach them without confirming they were interested first. I didn’t mean to make anyone uncomfortable, and I really didn’t intend to pressure them into adopting a pet they weren’t ready for.

However, this time we invited a new friend, Sarah (F28), who had recently moved to town. Sarah is an introvert and can be a bit shy, but she's also very sweet.

To make her feel included, I suggested we play a cooperative game that requires teamwork and communication. Everyone agreed, and we set up the game while I prepared some snacks. I made sure to include a variety of options to cater to everyone’s preferences, including some vegan snacks since I knew Sarah follows a vegan diet.

As we were playing, I noticed that Sarah was struggling to contribute to the game. She seemed hesitant to share her ideas, and it was clear she was having a hard time breaking out of her shell. I tried to encourage her by asking for her thoughts on the game strategy, but she still seemed uncomfortable.

At one point, to lighten the mood, I jokingly said, ""Come on, Sarah! Don’t be shy! We promise we won’t bite! Unless you’re into that, then we might!"" I thought it would help her relax, but instead, she went quiet and seemed even more uncomfortable. The atmosphere shifted a bit, and I felt bad that my joke might have crossed a line.

Initially, I was excited to have siblings, but things didn’t go as smoothly as I hoped. Jake and Emily were both very outgoing, while I was more reserved and preferred reading or doing crafts alone.

At first, I tried to get along with them, but Jake would often tease me or try to drag me into their games, which I didn’t enjoy. Emily was sweet and would try to include me, but it felt forced. As a result, I often withdrew and spent more time in my room. Things got complicated when I started to notice that my stepdad would often favor Jake and Emily during family activities, and I felt left out.

Fast forward a few years, and my mom and stepdad divorced when I was 16. After the divorce, Jake and Emily moved in with their mom, and I moved back in with my mom. I didn’t see them much after that, but I always felt a little guilty for not being closer to them. 

Recently, Jake reached out to me via social media, asking if I wanted to hang out. I was hesitant because I hadn’t seen them in years and wasn’t sure if we had anything in common. I politely declined, saying I was busy, and I honestly didn’t feel comfortable. Jake responded by saying he missed me and hoped we could reconnect.

As her going-away party approached, I felt conflicted. I wanted to support her and celebrate this new chapter in her life, but I dreaded the idea of saying goodbye. The closer the date got, the more anxious I became about attending.

On the day of the party, I decided to go but ended up feeling overwhelmed by the emotions swirling around. When it was my turn to say goodbye, I got choked up and found myself tearing up, which made it hard for me to express what I wanted to say. Instead of my usual cheerful self, I ended up being a bit distant and quiet. 

My friend noticed and later reached out to me, saying she felt like I wasn't present at the party and it made her sad. I explained how I was feeling and how hard it was for me to see her go. She understood, but I worried that I might have ruined her special night.

In the end, we both realized that it was a tough situation for both of us. We agreed that it was okay to feel sad about goodbyes and that we were both just trying to navigate our feelings in the best way we could. It wasn’t a matter of one of us being wrong; it was just a really emotional time for both of us.",885,1247,0.79,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_51674,2021-08-24 00:00:00,NAH,1401,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"WIBTA for setting boundaries with my sister during family gatherings?

My sister and I have always had a complex relationship. She's fun and outgoing, but she tends to take things too far when it comes to jokes and teasing, especially around our family. Recently, during a family dinner, she made a joke about my career that felt more hurtful than funny. It wasn't the first time she’s crossed the line, but I usually brush it off to keep the peace.

With the holidays coming up, I want to set some boundaries for our next family gathering. I plan to tell her that while I appreciate her humor, there are certain topics that I would like her to avoid, especially anything related to my job and personal life. I believe it's important to create a comfortable environment for everyone, and I think she might not realize how her jokes can affect me.

I don’t want to sound overly sensitive, but I’ve noticed that her humor often makes others uncomfortable too, even if they don’t say anything. I think it would be beneficial for our family dynamic if I expressed my feelings directly, but I’m worried that it might lead to tension between us.

So, WIBTA for wanting to set these boundaries and encourage a more respectful atmosphere during our family gatherings?",466,2735,0.58,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_75747,2022-09-17 00:00:00,NAH,1259,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I've been friends with Sarah for years, and she recently got engaged. She asked me to be one of her bridesmaids, which I was thrilled about! I love her and want to support her on her special day. The wedding is set for next summer, and she has been sharing her ideas for the big event.

Recently, Sarah sent out a group message to the bridesmaids, asking for our input on the flower arrangements. She was expressing her excitement but also some stress about what to choose. I genuinely wanted to help, so I took some time to research different flower options and sent her a few ideas that I thought would fit her style and the vibe she wanted for the wedding.

A few days later, Sarah called me to discuss the flowers and mentioned that she really loved the ideas I shared. However, she also said she felt overwhelmed and wasn’t sure if she wanted to go with any of them because they didn’t match her original vision. I could hear the stress in her voice, and I understood that planning a wedding can be incredibly daunting.

I gently suggested that instead of trying to please everyone, she should focus on what she truly wants for her wedding day. I encouraged her to follow her gut instinct because that’s what will make her happiest. I also mentioned that if she wanted, I could help her brainstorm flowers that aligned more with her vision, instead of just throwing in ideas that might not resonate with her.

Later that week, Sarah texted me to say she appreciated my support but then said that she felt a bit guilty for not taking everyone's suggestions, including mine. I reassured her that it's her day, and she should choose what she loves. It’s important to me that she feels comfortable and happy on her wedding day. 

I’m glad we had that conversation, and I hope it relieved some of her stress. We're all in this together, and I just want to be a good friend during this time.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I work at a local grocery store, and we have a pretty strict policy about not allowing customers to eat or drink in the aisles. This is mainly to keep the store clean and to prevent spills that might create hazards for other shoppers. Most customers respect this, but occasionally, someone will push back.

One day, a mother came in with her toddler, who was clearly hungry and cranky. As I was restocking some shelves, I noticed the child was getting upset, and the mom was trying to calm him down. She pulled out a snack from her bag and began to open it. I approached them and politely reminded her of our store policy.

I said, ""I’m really sorry, but we ask that customers don’t eat in the aisles to help keep everything clean. I know it’s tough with a little one, but there’s a sitting area near the entrance where you can feed him.""

The mom looked frustrated, and she said, ""But he's hungry, and I just need a minute!"" I understood her struggle, and I did feel bad for her, but I reiterated the policy. She sighed and said, ""Fine,"" and moved to the sitting area, where she was able to feed her son.

Afterward, a nearby customer nodded at me and said, ""Good job sticking to the rules,"" but I felt bad about the interaction. I know it can be tough juggling kids and errands, and I didn’t want to come off as unsympathetic. 

I talked to my manager later, who said I handled it correctly, but I still wonder if I was too rigid in that situation. So, am I the asshole for enforcing a store policy in a tough moment for that mom?",387,1659,0.63,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_76268,2022-03-07 00:00:00,NAH,1536,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I (female) recently had a situation during a group study session at the library with a few classmates. We were preparing for a big exam, and everyone was feeling the pressure. One of my classmates, Jake, was really stressed out and kept expressing his anxiety about not understanding some of the material.

At one point, he got up to grab a snack and left his notes on the table. I noticed that he had highlighted some key points that I hadn't thought to study, so I quickly jotted down a few notes from his papers while he was gone. When he returned, he saw me writing and immediately got upset, thinking I was stealing his study materials.

I tried to explain that I was just taking notes from what he had highlighted and not copying his entire work. He cooled down a bit, but the tension was palpable. The other classmates chimed in, saying they understood both perspectives: I was just trying to help myself study, but Jake was right to feel protective of his notes, especially since we were all stressed.

In the end, we collectively decided to share our notes with each other to help everyone prepare better. Jake apologized for overreacting, and I felt bad for making him uncomfortable, even though it wasn’t my intention.

She spends a lot of time working on her paintings and has even started selling some of them at local markets. I've always admired her dedication and creativity, but I also noticed that she can get quite stressed when preparing for shows. 

Recently, she had a big exhibition coming up. She invited a group of friends, including me, to support her on the opening night. I was excited to go, but as the day approached, I started feeling unwell. I came down with a bad cold, complete with a sore throat and a fever. I didn't want to risk getting her or anyone else sick, so I decided to stay home and rest. 

On the night of the exhibition, I sent Sarah a message wishing her the best and apologizing for not being able to make it. I thought she would understand, but later that night, she posted on social media about how overwhelmed she felt. In her post, she mentioned how it would have meant a lot to have all her friends there, especially since she had put in so much effort into her artwork.

The next day, I reached out to her to check in. She seemed a bit distant and told me she was feeling a bit let down that I didn't come. I explained my situation and that it was not personal, but she still seemed hurt. I felt bad for not being there for her, but I also thought it was important to prioritize health.

I realized that both of us were just trying to navigate our feelings—she wanted support, and I wanted to be responsible.

No one is the Asshole,"I’m in my late 20s, and I’ve always had a rocky relationship with my parents. They were strict growing up, and I felt like I could never live up to their expectations. Fast forward to a few years ago, I finally decided to move out and start living life on my own terms. It was a big step for me, but I felt liberated and happier.

However, my decision didn’t sit well with my parents. They took it as a personal rejection and would often make passive-aggressive comments about my lifestyle choices. I tried to maintain some level of communication with them, but every conversation would inevitably turn into them criticizing my decisions, whether it was about my job, my friends, or my relationship status.

A year later, I had to attend a family gathering for my grandmother’s birthday. I was looking forward to it, but once I arrived, the atmosphere was tense. My parents started in on me again, and while I tried to stay calm, I eventually snapped and told them that I was tired of their negativity and that I wasn't going to let them dictate my life anymore. It escalated into a heated argument, with me walking out in tears.

After that incident, I decided to take a step back from my relationship with my parents. I felt it was necessary for my mental health, as I realized that every interaction left me feeling drained and anxious. I didn’t cut them off completely, but I started limiting my responses and interactions. I would check in occasionally, but I wouldn’t engage in deeper conversations.

Now, my older brother, who has always been more aligned with my parents, is caught in the middle. He reached out to me recently, expressing his concern about the distance between me and our parents. He feels that by not engaging with them, I’m pushing them further away and making things worse. I understand his perspective, but I also feel like he doesn’t fully grasp how toxic our interactions have been for me.

I told him that while I appreciate his concern, I need to prioritize my mental health and that I don’t want to be pulled back into the cycle of negativity. I also reassured him that I’m not completely shutting them out; I’m just setting boundaries.

Now, I’m wondering if I’m being unreasonable for taking this step back from my parents, especially since it seems to have upset my brother. I don’t want to be the bad guy here, but I also need to look out for myself.

No one is the Asshole,"My friend (f26) and I (f25) have been close since college, and we generally have a good rapport. Recently, she started dating someone new (m28) who seems nice enough, but I can tell my friend is infatuated and a bit swept away in the romance. 

Last week, she invited me over for dinner to meet him. I was excited to see her and get to know her new boyfriend. However, during the dinner, I noticed her checking her phone multiple times, and she seemed distracted. I thought maybe it was just nerves about introducing us.

As the night went on, things took a turn. My friend’s boyfriend started making some offhand comments about how he doesn’t understand why people spend so much time on their phones instead of enjoying the moment. He made a joke about “people who can’t put their phones down” and looked directly at my friend, who quickly put her phone down. I could tell she felt embarrassed.

After dinner, I tried to lighten the mood by suggesting we play a board game. My friend’s boyfriend seemed uninterested and even suggested we play a video game instead, which felt a bit dismissive to me, but I rolled with it. I thought maybe he just wanted to bond with her in a different way.

Towards the end of the night, I noticed my friend looked increasingly uncomfortable. At one point, I couldn’t help but mention how it seemed like her boyfriend was putting her on the spot about her phone usage, which felt unfair. She got defensive and said I was overreacting and that he was just teasing her. I told her I was looking out for her, but she snapped at me, saying I was being rude to him and that I should try to get to know him instead of picking at his jokes.

I felt bad for bringing it up in front of him, but I also thought it was important for her to be aware of how he was treating her. After they walked me home, I could tell she was upset, and I apologized for saying anything. Now, she hasn’t responded to my texts, and I feel like I might have crossed a line.

I care about my friend and want her to be happy, but I also don’t want her to feel like she can’t speak up if something bothers her.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I was at a local park with my dog, enjoying the sunny afternoon. There were a few other people around, including a couple of families with kids. My dog, a friendly golden retriever, loves to play, so I let him off his leash in a designated area where dogs are allowed to run free.

As I was tossing a ball for him, I noticed a little girl, maybe around 5 years old, watching him play. She seemed really excited and wanted to join in, but her parents were sitting on a bench nearby, not really paying attention. After a few minutes, the girl approached us and asked if she could throw the ball for my dog.

I thought it was sweet, so I said, “Of course! Just make sure to throw it gently.” She was thrilled and started throwing the ball, and my dog loved chasing after it. However, after a few throws, she accidentally threw it a bit too hard, and it went flying into a nearby patch of bushes.

The girl looked a bit sad and said, “Uh-oh, I can’t reach it.” I went over to help her get the ball, but at that moment, her parents noticed and started calling her back, saying she shouldn't play with strange dogs. They came over, looking a bit upset, and the dad said, “We don’t know this dog. It’s not safe.” 

I understood their concern, but I also felt bad for the girl who was just trying to have fun. I said, “I promise, he’s friendly, and I’ll keep him close while we get the ball.” The parents were still hesitant, and I could sense that they were worried. After a brief exchange, I reassured them and brought my dog back to show that he was calm and well-behaved.

In the end, the parents seemed to relax a bit, and we all retrieved the ball together. The girl was happy, and I felt good about helping out, but I also didn’t want to overstep any boundaries with her parents.

So was I in the wrong for letting her throw the ball for my dog in the first place, or for trying to help? I genuinely just wanted everyone to have a nice time at the park.",679,1244,0.88,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_74823,2020-08-19 00:00:00,NAH,1956,AITA

Before we met, I traveled a lot for work and saw many places, while she hasn't had the chance to explore as much outside of a few family trips.

As we were planning our next vacation, I suggested we go to a destination I really enjoyed during my travels, a beautiful city known for its art and culture. I thought it would be exciting to share that experience with her. However, she expressed a desire to go somewhere completely different, maybe a beach resort where she could relax and unwind.

I understood her perspective but felt a bit disappointed since I wanted to share this special place with her. I shared my feelings, explaining how meaningful that destination was to me and how I thought she'd love it too. I also offered to compromise by spending a few days there followed by a beach getaway.

After some back and forth, we both realized we were each coming from different places. I was fixated on my own experiences, while she was looking forward to creating new ones in a setting she preferred. We ended up deciding to take turns choosing vacation spots, so we can both experience what we want and sometimes meet in the middle.

No one is the Asshole,"I've been living in a small apartment with my roommate for the past year, and we've developed a pretty good friendship. We both have our quirks, and we generally get along well. However, there's been a recent issue that I feel we handled pretty well, and I’d like to get some outside opinions.

I have a small collection of plants that I’ve been nurturing for a while, and it’s something I genuinely enjoy. I have a few rare ones that I’ve spent quite a bit of time and money on to acquire. My roommate, on the other hand, isn’t really into plants and thinks they’re kind of a hassle. He jokingly calls them “the jungle” and has expressed that he finds them a bit overwhelming.

A few weeks ago, I noticed that he was cranking the air conditioning quite low in our apartment, which can be rough on the plants. One day, I mentioned to him that I was concerned about the temperature for them and suggested we could keep the AC at a moderate temperature instead. He shrugged it off and said he liked it cold.

I decided to compromise and started keeping my plants in my room, where the temperature is more stable. However, he then complained that the kitchen and living room felt ""too hot"" when he was trying to relax. I lightly suggested that maybe he could wear a sweater if he was cold, but he felt I was being dismissive of his discomfort.

We had a heart-to-heart about it, and I explained why my plants mean so much to me, while he shared his feelings about the temperature. In the end, we agreed to a middle ground: we would keep the AC at a temperature that worked for both of us, and I would keep my plants in my room, with the occasional one allowed in common areas for aesthetic balance.

I feel like we both made sacrifices to reach a mutual understanding, but I’m still worried I might have been selfish by insisting on keeping my plants.

Recently, Sarah started dating a guy named Jake. They hit it off immediately, and I was thrilled for her. However, I noticed that once they became a couple, Sarah began to spend almost all her time with him. I completely understand wanting to be with someone you care about, but it felt like I was losing my best friend in the process. We used to hang out almost every day, and now I’d be lucky to see her once a week.

One day, feeling a little hurt and neglected, I reached out to Sarah and expressed how I was feeling. I told her that I missed our time together and wished we could still have our friendship, along with her new relationship. I didn't mean to come across as jealous, but I think it might have sounded that way. Sarah got defensive and said that she was still there for me and that I needed to be happy for her instead of making her feel guilty.

After our conversation, Sarah seemed distant, and I felt awful for saying anything. I realized that I might have overstepped by trying to dictate how she balanced her relationship and friendships. A few days later, I reached out to apologize, and we talked it out. She reassured me that our friendship was still important to her, and I promised to give her space without feeling abandoned.

A week before the trip, we both realized that the weather forecast predicted heavy rain for the entire duration of our trip.

I suggested that we postpone the camping trip to avoid the rain and make the most of our time outdoors, but my friend was adamant about going anyway. She said she didn't mind the rain and insisted it would be a fun adventure. I wasn't convinced, but I didn't want to be the party pooper, so I reluctantly agreed to stick to our original plan.

Background: I (28F) have a close-knit group of friends, and we’ve always celebrated our birthdays together. This year, I decided to throw a surprise party for my best friend, Sara (27F), since she’s been feeling down lately. I wanted to make it special, so I planned a whole day of activities leading up to a big dinner.

However, another friend, Mia (26F), had also been planning to celebrate her own birthday around the same time, but she hadn’t discussed it with us. When I mentioned my plans to the group, Mia expressed that she felt upset because she wanted a celebration too, and she felt overshadowed by my surprise for Sara.

I genuinely didn’t mean to hurt Mia’s feelings, and I offered to combine the celebrations. We could celebrate Sara’s surprise during the day and then have Mia’s birthday party in the evening. Mia, however, felt that combining the two would take away from her special day and said she would rather not celebrate at all if it meant sharing the spotlight.

This led to some tension in our friend group. Sara was excited about the surprise, and I didn’t want to cancel it. I suggested that if Mia wanted to celebrate her birthday separately, we could plan something for her the following weekend, but she seemed hurt and refused to discuss it further.

In my mind, I felt torn because I wanted to support both friends. Ultimately, I decided to move forward with the surprise party for Sara, but I made sure to reach out to Mia afterward to apologize for any hurt feelings and to reassure her that her birthday was important to me too.

No one is the Asshole,"**UPDATE (original post deleted, see it in the comments)**

I wanted to share an update because things have taken an unexpected turn. This is going to be a bit long.

***TL;DR: After reflecting on everything, I realize we all had our reasons, but nobody was really at fault.***

So, a few weeks ago, my friend Emily and I had a falling out over some misunderstandings. She and I have been close for years, but recently, I felt like she was pulling away. When I confronted her about it, I ended up saying some hurtful things, accusing her of not caring about our friendship anymore. She got upset and told me that she was going through a tough time personally and had simply been overwhelmed.

After our argument, I felt awful and reached out to apologize. Her response was measured; she accepted my apology but mentioned that she had been feeling really stressed and needed some space to process everything. I realized that I had put too much pressure on her to maintain our friendship in the same way during her difficult time.

In the following days, I took the time to think about my own actions. I spoke to a mutual friend who helped me see things from Emily's perspective. It wasn’t just about me feeling neglected; she was genuinely struggling with her mental health, and my expectations were adding to her stress.

So, I decided to give her the space she needed but also gently checked in after a week. I sent her a text saying I was thinking of her and that I missed our chats. She responded warmly, thanking me for being understanding and told me she was starting to feel better. We ended up having a long conversation where we both expressed our feelings about our friendship changes and how tough life has been for both of us lately.

In the end, we both realized that we were neither fully in the wrong nor completely innocent. We had simply lost touch amid our individual struggles. We agreed to be more open with each other moving forward and to check in more frequently.

I feel relieved that we could work it out, and I learned a valuable lesson about empathy and communication. So, I guess it's true what they say: sometimes misunderstandings happen, and it’s okay to take a step back and reevaluate.

I just wanted to thank everyone who offered advice and insight. It helped tremendously, and now I think we're in a better place as friends.",408,1105,0.62,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_56444,2024-11-23 00:00:00,NAH,2358,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I recently organized a surprise birthday party for my best friend, who has been going through a tough time. She loves the outdoors, so I decided to host the party at a local park with a picnic setup. I invited a mix of her friends and family, making sure to keep it a surprise.

To keep things simple, I asked everyone to bring a dish to share. I made sure to specify that it would be a potluck-style event so that no one felt pressured to spend a lot of money. However, I also mentioned that my friend is vegetarian, so I encouraged people to bring vegetarian-friendly dishes if they could.

The day of the party arrived, and I was excited to see everyone come together. However, as the guests started to arrive, I noticed that a few of them had brought meat-based dishes despite my request. I understand that not everyone is familiar with my friend's dietary preferences, but I felt a bit frustrated. I wanted the day to be special for her and was worried that she might feel uncomfortable with the food choices.

When my friend arrived, she was completely surprised and thrilled. Everyone cheered, and we all sat down to eat. As we started serving the food, I noticed my friend looking at the meat dishes with disappointment. I tried to divert her attention to the salads and vegetarian options, but she still seemed a bit put off.

After the initial excitement wore off, I gently spoke to the guests who had brought meat dishes, explaining that I had mentioned my friend's vegetarianism in the invitation. They apologized and said they didn’t realize it was such a big deal, but they were just trying to contribute. I appreciated their intentions, but I also felt it was important to communicate the dietary preferences clearly.

In the end, my friend had a wonderful time, and everyone enjoyed the party. However, I still felt a bit conflicted about how to handle the food situation. I didn’t want to make anyone feel bad for bringing food, but I also wanted to ensure my friend felt celebrated and comfortable. Am I the asshole for being disappointed in the food choices at her surprise party, or were the guests just trying to contribute in their own way?",497,1366,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_17482,2019-12-18 00:00:00,NAH,2162,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Anonymous account for me:

I (34M) have a younger sister (22F) who has always been a bit of a free spirit. She recently moved in with me after a rough break-up, and I’ve been trying to support her as she gets back on her feet. However, she has a tendency to leave her belongings scattered around the house, and it’s been driving me a bit crazy. 

I’m generally pretty tidy and like to keep things organized, so I’ve tried gently reminding her to clean up after herself. I know she’s going through a tough time, and I don’t want to be too harsh, but it just feels overwhelming sometimes. The other day, I came home from work to find the kitchen covered in dirty dishes and the living room a mess. I took a deep breath and decided to clean up myself, but I also wrote her a text letting her know how I felt and that I’d appreciate it if she could be more considerate.

When she got home, she was upset about the text. She felt that I was being too critical during a time when she’s struggling. I explained that it wasn’t just about the mess but also about mutual respect in our shared living space. We ended up having a heart-to-heart conversation, and I realized that I could have approached the situation more compassionately. She apologized for not being more aware of how her actions affected me and promised to try harder.

We both agreed that we need to communicate better moving forward. It felt like a productive conversation, but I can’t help but wonder if I overstepped by texting her about it instead of talking face to face first.

No one is the Asshole,"I really need some perspective on this situation, so here goes.

A few months ago, my best friend, Sarah, and I were planning a trip to a music festival that we’ve both been looking forward to for over a year. We have been friends for nearly a decade, and we always have a great time together. However, about two weeks before the festival, Sarah’s sister was involved in a serious car accident. Thankfully, she’s okay now, but it was a very stressful time for Sarah and her family, and she was understandably worried about her sister.

I felt terrible for Sarah and wanted to support her, but I also really wanted to go to the festival. It had been a big deal for us, and I had already bought non-refundable tickets. After some back and forth, Sarah insisted that she couldn’t go because she needed to be there for her sister, and I completely understood. I didn’t want to pressure her, but I was also feeling disappointed.

A couple of days later, I decided to reach out to another friend, Emily, who I knew loved the same bands and would enjoy the festival just as much. I asked her if she wanted to go with me, and she agreed. I told Sarah about it after I had made plans with Emily, and she seemed a bit hurt. She said that she felt like I was abandoning her during a tough time, even though I reassured her that I would support her and check in regularly.

I tried to explain that while I wanted to be there for her, I also needed to take care of my own feelings and plans. I figured it was okay to go with someone else since she couldn’t make it, but now I feel like I might have crossed a line. Sarah has been a bit distant since then, and I’m worried that I might have hurt her feelings.

So, AITA for going to the festival with another friend when my best friend couldn’t make it due to family issues? I didn’t mean to hurt her, but I also wanted to enjoy something I had been looking forward to for a long time.",263,1972,0.89,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_91026,2020-11-19 00:00:00,NAH,1921,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I (F17) have a close group of friends, and we often hang out together after school. One of my friends, Sarah (F17), has been going through a tough time lately. She recently broke up with her boyfriend, and it's clear she's been feeling pretty down about it.

To lift her spirits, I suggested we have a girls' night at my place. I invited our other friends, and we planned a fun evening with movies, snacks, and some games. Everyone was excited and committed to making Sarah feel better.

On the day of the event, I noticed that another friend, Emily (F16), seemed a bit distant and withdrawn. She didn't respond to the group messages about our plans and even told me she had other things to do that evening. I reached out to her and said we’d love to have her join us, but she insisted she wasn't feeling up to it.

That night, we had a great time, laughing and chatting, but I couldn't help but feel a little guilty for leaving Emily out, especially since she usually brings a lot of energy to our group. I later found out that Emily felt really left out and said she was hurt we didn't try harder to get her to join us.

I understand that she needed space, but I also feel that we did try to include her. It was mainly about supporting Sarah, and I don’t want anyone to feel rejected.

I've always been a bit shy when it comes to meeting new people, but I wanted to make an effort to get to know my neighbors, especially since I was really excited about living in this community.

One day, I decided to host a small gathering in my apartment to break the ice. I invited a few neighbors I had met briefly in passing and made sure to keep it casual, offering snacks and drinks. I even printed out a little flyer with my name and apartment number, encouraging anyone who was interested to drop by.

As the evening went on, I felt really good about the atmosphere. People were chatting, laughing, and sharing stories. At one point, I noticed that a couple of neighbors were a bit more withdrawn. They were sitting together, looking uncomfortable, so I decided to approach them. We started talking, and I could sense they were hesitant to fully engage.

I tried to lighten the mood by cracking a few jokes and inviting them to share more about themselves. However, they remained a bit distant, and I noticed one of them seemed to be getting increasingly annoyed. Eventually, they excused themselves and left the gathering early.

I later learned from another neighbor that those two had recently gone through a tough experience and were not in the mood for socializing. I felt terrible for not being more sensitive to their situation and for possibly making them feel pressured to engage.

I’ve been reflecting on the situation and wondering if I might have pushed them too hard to join in the fun, even though I was just trying to be friendly.

To combat this, I suggested we take a weekend trip to a nearby cabin in the woods to unwind and reconnect. My partner was initially excited, but then expressed some concerns about the cost. I completely understood, as we’re both trying to save money for our future. I offered to cover the cost of the cabin rental since I had some extra savings, which made my partner feel a bit more at ease.

However, as we planned the trip, my partner started bringing up other expenses like food and activities, suggesting we should cut back and find cheaper options. While I agreed that budgeting is important, I really wanted this trip to be a chance for us to indulge a little and enjoy each other's company without the usual pressures. I felt that spending a bit more was worth it for the memories and quality time we’d have.

This led to a bit of tension as my partner felt stressed about the potential financial burden, and I felt frustrated that my intentions were being misunderstood. Eventually, we talked it out and I reassured them that I was happy to cover the costs and that it was okay to splurge a bit for our mental health.

In the end, we agreed on a balance where we could enjoy the trip without going overboard. It took some communication, but we both recognized that our individual concerns were valid, and we didn’t want to let financial worries spoil our time together.

Initially, I tried to be supportive and gave her space, understanding that new relationships can be consuming. However, as time went on, I started to feel neglected. I miss our regular hangouts and the deep conversations we used to have. It seems like every time I try to reach out, she’s busy with her new partner.

One day, I decided to talk to her about it. I approached the situation delicately, expressing that I was happy for her but also felt a bit left out. I suggested that maybe she could set aside time for us to catch up, even just for a coffee. To my surprise, she became defensive and said that I was being selfish for wanting her attention when she was happy. She accused me of not supporting her relationship.

After a bit of back-and-forth, we both realized we weren't really angry with each other but were just trying to navigate this change in our friendship. We ended up having a heartfelt conversation about balancing friendships and romantic relationships. We both agreed that it was important to make time for each other, no matter how busy life gets.

I was thrilled for her, but I was also disappointed because I had already committed to the camping trip with my friends. My sister asked me to be there for her wedding, and I felt torn.

I talked to my friends about the situation. They were understanding, but they expressed how much they were counting on me to be there since I help plan the activities and keep the group organized.

I informed my friends, and they were supportive but expressed their disappointment.

The thing is, he has a wife and two young kids, and I worry about their financial stability. When he told the family about his decision, I expressed my concerns, trying to be supportive but also honest about my worries. I mentioned that while I believe in chasing dreams, I felt he should consider getting a part-time job or at least having a solid plan in place before making such a drastic change.

I didn’t mean to come off as dismissive of his dreams, but my brother seemed really hurt by my comments, and it led to a bit of a heated discussion.

I'm a 30-year-old man and I've always had a complicated relationship with my younger brother, who is now 25. Growing up, we had a typical sibling rivalry, but things took a turn when our parents divorced about five years ago. My brother took the divorce really hard and leaned heavily on me for support since I had already moved out and was settled in my own life. At first, I was happy to be there for him, but over time, I started to feel overwhelmed and burdened by his constant need for reassurance.

Recently, my brother called me up, distressed about a breakup he was going through. He seemed to spiral deeper into sadness over the course of the week, and I could feel my own frustration mounting. I tried to be supportive, but I also found myself needing some space. I decided to take a day for myself, disconnecting from my phone and focusing on self-care. I didn’t respond to his texts or calls that day, which I felt guilty about.

The next day, I reached out to him and explained that I needed a little time to recharge. He was upset and told me that he felt abandoned when I didn’t respond. I reassured him that I love him and want to support him, but I also need to take care of my own mental health. He seemed to understand but has since been a bit distant, and I worry that I hurt his feelings.

I think we both need to learn how to navigate this new territory in our relationship, especially since things have changed so much after our parents' divorce.

No one is the Asshole,"First time posting here, so here goes!

Last weekend, my friends and I decided to have a movie night at my place. I offered to host and provide snacks, and everyone was super excited. I went all out and bought popcorn, chips, candy, and drinks. About an hour before the movie started, one of my friends, Sarah, messaged me asking if she could bring her own snacks since she was trying to stick to a diet. I thought it was a bit odd since I was already providing a lot, but I told her it was totally fine.

When Sarah arrived, she brought a bunch of healthy snacks like veggie sticks and hummus, which I appreciated. But during the movie, she kept making comments about how unhealthy the food I provided was. At first, I tried to laugh it off, but it started to feel a bit judgmental. After a while, I just said, “Hey, you're welcome to enjoy whatever you brought, but maybe we can focus on the movie instead of food?” 

She seemed a bit taken aback and said she was just joking. The vibe shifted a bit, and I felt bad for saying anything at all. My other friends were just trying to enjoy the snacks, and I didn't want to create any tension. 

Edit: AITA for asking Sarah to lighten up about the snacks and just enjoy the movie? 

I really just wanted everyone to have a good time without judgment over food choices.",581,2280,0.64,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_63123,2024-12-16 00:00:00,NAH,1316,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"This happened a few days ago, and I’m using a throwaway because I really want an unbiased perspective on this.

So, I’m 16/M, and I was hanging out with a couple of my friends at a local park. We often go there to chill, play some games, and just enjoy the fresh air. That day, there was a large family gathering nearby, and they were celebrating something with a big picnic. There was a lot of laughter and fun, and we could hear them from where we were sitting.

At one point, I noticed a little girl, about 5 or 6 years old, who was trying to catch the attention of her parents. She was being really cute and energetic, running around and waving her arms, but every time she got close to them, they seemed distracted or busy with the festivities. I thought it was kind of sad, so I jokingly said to my friends, “I bet they’re too busy with the food to notice her!” 

I didn’t mean it in a mean way; I was just trying to lighten the mood. My friends laughed, and we continued our conversation. A few minutes later, the girl ran past us, and I couldn’t help but smile at her enthusiasm. I even waved back at her, and she waved at me with a huge grin.

Then, a relative of the girl, who looked to be in her late 20s, came over and gave me a stern look. She said something like, “That’s not funny, you shouldn’t mock her parents like that.” I was taken aback because I honestly didn’t think my comment was hurtful. I tried to explain that I was just trying to be lighthearted and that I thought the girl was adorable, but she walked away, clearly upset.

Later, I talked to my friends about it, and they felt I didn’t do anything wrong. They thought the relative overreacted. I’m still left feeling a bit guilty, though, because I didn’t want to come across as disrespectful. Do you think I was TA for making that comment, or was the relative overreacting?",101,889,0.9,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_48767,2020-02-23 00:00:00,NAH,1855,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, I want to share something that happened recently at a family gathering, and I’m not sure if I handled it the best way. 

My family has always been a bit complicated. My parents divorced when I was in my early teens, and while they both moved on and are in better places now, the tension around holidays can sometimes feel palpable. My mom is generally the more emotional one, while my dad tends to keep things light-hearted, even in sensitive situations. 

Last week, we had a family reunion, and it was nice to see everyone. My mom and dad were both there, which is always a bit of a balancing act for me. At one point during dinner, my dad made a joke about his new girlfriend, and everyone laughed. I appreciated his attempt to keep the mood light, but I noticed my mom’s expression changed. She looked bothered, and I could tell it hit her hard.

Later in the evening, I was chatting with my siblings when my mom approached us and mentioned that she felt uncomfortable when my dad joked about his new relationship. I immediately noticed the shift in her mood, and I felt torn. I wanted to support my mom, but I also didn’t want to ruin the atmosphere that my dad was trying to create. 

In an attempt to smooth things over, I reassured my mom that it was just a joke and that my dad meant no harm. I thought I was being helpful, but she seemed even more upset and said I didn’t understand how she felt. I felt bad, and I tried to explain that I loved her and wanted her to enjoy the evening, but I think I might have come off as dismissive.

Afterward, I spoke to my dad about it, and he expressed that he didn’t mean to hurt anyone. He was just trying to lighten the mood. We ended up having a good conversation about being sensitive to each other's feelings, and I think we both learned something.

So, I’m left wondering if I should have taken my mom's side more emphatically or if I handled the situation well by trying to keep the peace. AITA?",943,1839,0.7,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_59070,2023-06-22 00:00:00,NAH,1956,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I've been friends with L for over a decade. She's always been ambitious and driven, but over the past few years, she’s been struggling with burnout. After a tough year at work and a family crisis, she decided to take a break from her job, which I fully supported. I thought it would be a great chance for her to recharge and focus on her mental health.

However, as the months went by, I noticed L wasn't really doing much to take care of herself. She seemed to be spending most of her days binge-watching shows, eating junk food, and isolating herself. While I understand that everyone copes differently, I began to worry that she was falling into a rut that might be hard for her to get out of.

I tried to encourage her to join me for walks or to pick up a hobby we used to enjoy together, but she often declined, saying she just didn't feel like it. I didn’t want to push too hard since I knew she was going through a lot, but part of me felt that if I didn't say something, I might be enabling her to remain stuck.

One day, during a conversation, I gently suggested that maybe it was time to start looking for a part-time job or to volunteer to help her regain some structure. I thought it might help her feel accomplished and give her a reason to get out of the house. She reacted quite defensively, saying that I didn’t understand what she was going through and that I was being unsupportive.

I felt terrible. I only wanted the best for her and to see her happy again, but I worried that my suggestion might have come off as me being judgmental or dismissive of her feelings. It left me questioning whether I was being a good friend or if I was just meddling in her life when she needed space.

Now, I'm feeling a mix of concern and guilt. I want to help, but I also don’t want to overstep. I care deeply for L, and I hope she finds her footing again, but I’m unsure if I crossed a line by bringing it up. I genuinely want to support her without coming off as pushy or insensitive.",663,2948,0.59,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_97316,2019-12-24 00:00:00,NAH,1990,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I'm 24F and I have a younger brother, 20M. Growing up, we were very close, but our relationship started to change when he went off to college. He made a lot of new friends and slowly started to drift away from our family traditions. I get that he wants to explore his independence, but it hurt to see him prioritize hanging out with friends over our family events.

Last month, we had our family reunion, which we’ve been doing every year for as long as I can remember. I was really excited to see everyone, especially my brother. However, when I found out he decided to skip it to go to a concert with his college friends, I was really upset. I felt like he was choosing his new life over our family.

In the heat of the moment, I sent him a message expressing my disappointment, saying that it was hurtful he wouldn’t even consider coming to something that’s important to our family. He responded by saying that he still loves us but that he needs to live his life and have fun, which made me feel guilty for expressing my feelings.

That night, I reflected on our conversation and realized I might have overreacted. I didn’t want to make him feel guilty for wanting to enjoy his college experience, but I did want him to understand how much our family events mean to me. I decided to apologize the next day for being harsh and told him that I just wanted him to know how much I value our family. He appreciated my apology, and we ended up having a good conversation about finding a balance between his new friends and family.

No one is the Asshole,"I (28F) recently had a disagreement with my sister (26F) that left us both feeling hurt, but I’m not sure if one of us is in the wrong. 

A few weeks ago, my sister announced that she was engaged to her long-term boyfriend. While I was excited for her, I also felt a bit sad because I had been planning to propose to my girlfriend (29F) soon. I had been waiting for the right moment to do it, but now I was worried about overshadowing my sister’s big news. 

I talked to my girlfriend about it, and we decided to hold off on our engagement for a bit so my sister could enjoy her moment. I told my sister what we were planning and she seemed genuinely appreciative, but I could sense she was a little disappointed that I wasn't going to propose soon. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks, and my sister asked me to be her maid of honor, which I happily accepted. However, during her wedding planning, she started dropping hints about wanting to have the wedding before the end of the year. I pointed out that if she chose a date too soon, it might still be too close to my own proposal, and I didn't want her to feel overshadowed.

This led to a heated conversation where she accused me of trying to control her wedding plans and being overly sensitive. I was just trying to be considerate, but I could tell she was really stressed about the wedding and felt like I was adding to it. 

We both ended up feeling hurt, and it seems like neither of us wanted to back down. I understand she wants her day to be special, but I also feel like my feelings are valid. 

Maybe I am being too sensitive about the timing, but I really want to support her without feeling like I’m sacrificing my own happiness. AITA for bringing up my proposal plans in conversation about her wedding?",303,1112,0.52,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_59596,2018-07-06 00:00:00,NAH,1767,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Hi everyone,

I’m in a bit of a situation and could use some outside perspective. I (27F) have a younger brother (19M) who recently started attending university. He’s been struggling to adjust and has had a tough time making friends. I’ve been trying to support him as best as I can, but I’m also busy with work and my own life.

Recently, he asked if I could help him throw a small gathering at my apartment for him and a few classmates. He wanted to create a comfortable environment where he could get to know them better. I agreed, happy to help him out, and we set a date for the gathering.

The day of the event, I got home from work and started preparing snacks and drinks. My brother had invited three friends, and all seemed fine until the guests arrived. One of them, a girl named Sarah, seemed to take charge of the event. She started rearranging my furniture, suggesting different games to play, and generally directing everyone. I felt a bit sidelined, but I didn’t want to ruin my brother's chance to bond with his friends.

As the night went on, I noticed that Sarah was very vocal and dismissive of my brother’s attempts to contribute to the gathering. It felt like she was kind of overshadowing him, which made me uncomfortable. I gently tried to intervene a couple of times, suggesting ideas that my brother had, but Sarah would cut me off and go back to her suggestions.

At one point, I decided to step outside for some fresh air, needing a moment to collect my thoughts. When I came back inside, I overheard my brother telling Sarah that he appreciated her help but would like to have more input too. I felt proud of him for standing up for himself, but Sarah took it poorly. She made a snide comment about “needing a backbone” and stormed out of the apartment.

After that, the atmosphere became tense. The remaining friends ended up leaving shortly after, and my brother looked really upset. I comforted him, but I feel caught in the middle. I wanted to help him, but I don’t want to step on anyone’s toes, especially if they’re just trying to be friendly.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for not saying something to Sarah during the gathering? I was trying to support my brother, but I also didn't want to create a scene. I’m just confused about whether I should have been more assertive in the moment.

**EDIT:** Thanks for the feedback, everyone! I’ll talk to my brother and see how he feels about what happened. I appreciate the perspective!",587,2229,0.86,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_91661,2021-11-12 00:00:00,NAH,2465,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Throwaway account since I'm not a regular Reddit user.

So, I need some perspective on a recent situation that happened with my friend and I. 

We were hanging out at my place last weekend when the topic of our favorite childhood movies came up. My best friend, who I’ll call Sam, mentioned a movie that I absolutely loved as a kid but had completely forgotten about. We both got really excited reminiscing about it and started sharing our favorite scenes. 

At one point, I got a bit carried away and suggested we have a movie night soon to rewatch some of our favorites – I even offered to host it and provide snacks. Sam seemed enthusiastic at first, but then suddenly became quiet. When I asked if everything was okay, Sam hesitated before admitting that they had some bad memories associated with that particular movie. I felt a bit blindsided because I had no idea, and I totally understand that people have different experiences with certain films.

I apologized for bringing it up and assured Sam that I didn’t mean to make them uncomfortable. But Sam seemed a little upset and expressed that they didn’t want to dwell on the past. I felt bad for not realizing that the movie was a sensitive topic for them, and I wondered if I should have known better given our long friendship.

Later, I reached out to Sam in a message to check in, and they appreciated that I cared, but I still can’t shake the feeling that I may have crossed a line. I certainly didn’t mean any harm, but I can see how it could have been awkward for them.

So, am I the asshole for bringing up a movie that caused discomfort? Or are we both just navigating our feelings and memories?",129,761,0.79,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_43816,2022-01-31 00:00:00,NAH,1662,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I (30M) have a close friend, Sarah (28F), who is passionate about her work in environmental conservation. She often organizes weekend clean-up events at local parks and beaches, and she always invites me to join her. While I admire her dedication, I often feel overwhelmed with my own responsibilities—balancing work, family commitments, and personal projects. I participate occasionally, but I can’t commit to every event.

Recently, Sarah planned a big clean-up event at a popular beach. She was really excited about it and put in a lot of effort to organize volunteers, get supplies, and promote the event. A few days before it was scheduled, she asked me again if I would help out. I explained that I had family visiting that weekend and wouldn’t be able to join. I felt bad, but I also knew I needed to prioritize my family time.

On the day of the event, I saw her social media posts with pictures of the clean-up and all the volunteers. She looked happy, but I also noticed that she had expressed disappointment that some of her close friends, including me, weren’t there to support her. I reached out to her later to tell her I was proud of the work she did and that I was sorry I couldn’t be there, but I was with my family.

She responded, acknowledging my message but also shared that she felt let down that I didn’t make an effort to be there for something so important to her. I completely understood where she was coming from, but I also felt like I had a right to prioritize my family commitments.

In the end, we had a heartfelt conversation about our differing priorities. I appreciated her passion and commitment to her cause, while she understood that I had my own responsibilities to manage.

No one is the Asshole,"I (28F) have been friends with my best friend Sarah (27F) for over a decade. We’ve always been incredibly close, sharing everything from our dreams and fears to our most embarrassing moments. Recently, however, things have become a bit complicated between us.

Sarah has been in a relationship with her boyfriend, Jake (30M), for about two years. While I think Jake is a decent guy, I’ve noticed that Sarah has been changing since they got together. She’s become more distant with me, often prioritizing her time with him over our friendship. I understand that this happens in relationships, but it’s been frustrating for me, especially given how close we used to be.

A few weeks ago, Sarah invited me to a weekend getaway with her and Jake. Initially, I was excited, as I thought it would be a fun opportunity to spend time together and reconnect. However, when I got there, it felt like I was just a third wheel. They were constantly whispering to each other, sharing inside jokes, and I felt more like an intruder than a guest. I tried to participate and engage, but it was clear they were in their bubble.

On the second night, I decided to express how I was feeling. I sat down with Sarah and told her that I missed our friendship and felt sidelined since she started dating Jake. She seemed taken aback and defensive at first, insisting that she still cares about our friendship but that things change when you’re in a relationship. I agreed and acknowledged that I understood that, but I also felt like I was losing her.

After our conversation, things felt a bit strained. She said she would work on balancing her time better, but there was still some tension. A few days later, I reached out and suggested we do something just the two of us to reconnect. She responded that she was busy with Jake and would let me know when she was free.

I felt hurt by this and wondered if I should take a step back from the friendship entirely to give her space. I didn’t want to come off as controlling or needy, but the distance was tough for me.

So, I’m wondering, would I be the asshole for wanting to take a break from our friendship to give Sarah some time with Jake, even if it means missing her? I really value our friendship, but I’m also feeling pretty upset about how things have been changing.",115,1330,0.88,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_30470,2024-09-07 00:00:00,NAH,2302,AITA

We had several discussions about this, where I expressed my excitement and the potential this opportunity holds for both of us. I told him that this could also be a chance for him to explore new horizons, but he insists that he loves his job and doesn’t want to leave. He feels that uprooting our lives just for my career aspirations is unfair to him.

I understand where he's coming from, but I can't help but feel frustrated. After all, I've always supported his career choices, and I just want him to see the potential in this move.

I grew up in a home where chores were split fairly evenly, while my partner was raised in a more traditional household where one person took care of most of the home duties. 

A couple of weeks ago, I noticed that dishes were piling up in the sink and the apartment was getting messy. I tried to bring it up gently, suggesting we sit down and discuss how we could split the chores more evenly. However, my partner took it personally and got defensive, saying they felt overwhelmed with everything else they had going on, including work and a side project.

I didn't mean to make them feel attacked, but I could see that I had struck a nerve. We ended up having a heated argument about it, where we both said things we didn't mean.

A couple of weeks ago, my close friend decided to throw a dinner party for her birthday and picked the same weekend as my sister’s bridal shower, which I’m also helping to organize.

Recently, my partner decided to take a cooking class, which I thought was a great idea. They were excited to learn new techniques and recipes, and I fully supported them.

After the class, my partner came home with a new dish they had learned to make: a fancy risotto. They spent a lot of time preparing it, and I could see how proud they were. When I tasted it, I thought it was delicious, but I made a comment about how I usually prefer a simpler version of risotto that I grew up eating.

However, my partner seemed to take it the wrong way and got a bit defensive. They said they wanted to impress me with their new skills and felt disappointed that I didn’t appreciate the effort. I assured them that I thought the risotto was great and that I loved how they were trying new things, but I admitted that I sometimes just like the comfort of familiar flavors.

This led to a deeper conversation about our cooking styles and preferences. I realized that my comment had unintentionally hurt their feelings, and I didn’t want to dismiss what they had worked hard to create. I apologized for how I framed my preference and reassured them that I genuinely appreciated their cooking.

Sarah was understanding, but I could tell she was disappointed. She mentioned that her friends were looking forward to having me along and she hoped I would change my mind. I felt really bad for letting her down, especially since I liked her and wanted to build our friendship.

I could see that she was really torn, and I didn’t want to add to her stress, but I also felt compelled to share my thoughts. I gently suggested that she consider what would make her happiest, regardless of what others might want, and that she should not feel pressured into a big wedding if it didn’t resonate with her.

She took my advice to heart and eventually decided to have a small wedding, which she feels more comfortable with. However, she later mentioned to me that she felt guilty for not considering her fiancé’s wishes enough, and that I might have influenced her decision too much. I reassured her that it was her wedding and she deserved to feel happy and comfortable, but I also felt a bit bad, thinking I might have overstepped by encouraging her to prioritize her feelings.

Now I’m wondering if I should have kept my opinions to myself to avoid complicating things for her. Was I wrong in suggesting she prioritize her own feelings? Would I be the asshole for possibly influencing her decision?",925,1708,0.72,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_45372,2020-11-14 00:00:00,NAH,1552,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been together for about five years, and we both have quite different approaches to organizing things in our home. I tend to be more laid-back about clutter and like to keep items where they naturally land, while my partner is very particular about organization and prefers everything in its designated spot. 

Recently, I started a new hobby that involves a lot of materials and tools scattered around the living room. I was really excited about it but didn’t realize how it was affecting my partner until they mentioned feeling overwhelmed by the mess. They expressed their frustration in a calm way, saying that it felt chaotic and it was hard for them to relax in that environment.

I completely understood where they were coming from and apologized. I didn’t mean to create a stressful atmosphere, but I was also a bit disappointed because I felt like I was being asked to suppress my enthusiasm for this new hobby. We ended up sitting down together and discussing how we could create a designated space for my materials that wouldn’t interfere with the living room.

In the end, we found a compromise that worked for both of us. I got a storage bin and a corner of the room to keep my hobby supplies, and they felt more at ease with the space. It was a good lesson in communication and understanding each other’s needs, and I think we both came out feeling respected.

She recently decided to take a step towards recovery by joining a local support group and starting therapy. I was really proud of her for making that decision because I know how hard it can be to reach out for help.

She asked me to come to her first support group meeting for moral support. I agreed without hesitation, wanting to be there for her. However, I found out the day before the meeting that it was a closed group, meaning only participants could be present. I told her this and suggested we could meet afterward for coffee instead.

When she got upset, saying she wanted me there for her, I felt bad but explained that it was a rule for the group to maintain confidentiality. I offered to attend future meetings or support her in any other way she needed, but she was still disappointed and said it felt like I was abandoning her in her time of need. I assured her I wasn't abandoning her and that I would always be there for her outside the meetings.

The next day, she went to the meeting without me. She later expressed that she felt alone and that my absence made her anxious about participating. I apologized for not being able to attend but reiterated that it was important to respect the group's guidelines.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently had a situation with my friends that has been weighing heavily on me, and I’m not sure if I handled it the right way.

Some Background...

A few weeks ago, my friend Sarah organized a small dinner party at her house. She invited a few close friends, including me and another friend, Mike. Sarah is a great host and loves to cook, so we were all excited to enjoy her homemade meals. 

As the night went on, the conversation turned to travel plans. Mike mentioned that he had been wanting to take a trip to Europe next summer and was looking for travel buddies. Sarah immediately chimed in, saying she would love to go with him. They started discussing potential itineraries and seemed really excited about the idea.

At this point, I felt a bit left out. I had also mentioned to Mike before that I would love to travel to Europe, but I hadn't said anything that night because I didn't want to interrupt their enthusiasm. However, after a while, I decided to express my interest too. I told them that I would love to join the trip if it happened. 

Sarah's response caught me off guard. She said, ""Oh, I didn't realize you wanted to go. I thought it was just going to be a trip for Mike and me."" I felt embarrassed and like I had overstepped. Mike tried to play it off, saying we could all go together, but the mood shifted a bit. It felt like Sarah was upset that I had intruded on her plans with Mike, even though I wasn't trying to do that at all.

After the dinner, I received a text from Sarah saying she was feeling a bit uncomfortable about the whole situation and that she didn’t want to complicate things between us. I felt awful because I really didn’t mean to make her feel that way. I apologized for bringing it up and told her that I completely understood if she wanted to keep the trip as just a two-person thing with Mike.

Now I’m left wondering if I did something wrong by expressing my interest. I never meant to create tension between my friends, and I genuinely thought we could all enjoy the trip together.

So, my sister (F28) and I (M26) have always been really close, but things have been a bit rocky lately. She’s been going through a tough time with her job and her mental health, and I’ve been trying my best to support her. She recently decided to take a break from work to focus on herself, which I totally respect and think is important.

Last week, she called me in tears because her friends had made plans to go on a weekend trip, and she felt left out since she couldn’t afford it right now. I listened and offered support, but I also gently reminded her that it might be a good idea to focus on her mental well-being instead of trying to keep up with everyone else.

Well, during our conversation, I mentioned that I had a wedding to attend soon and was super excited about it. I casually said that if she wanted to join me, I’d be happy to cover her ticket as a way to get her out of the house and have some fun together. She initially seemed excited about the idea, but then she snapped at me, saying that I was trying to “fix her” and that she didn’t want to be a burden.

I was really taken aback by her reaction because that wasn’t my intention at all. I just wanted to help her have a good time. I tried to explain that I genuinely wanted her to come along, but she wouldn’t hear it and ended up hanging up on me.

Now I’m left feeling confused and upset. I care about her and want to support her, but I also don’t want to overstep or make her feel worse.

No one is the Asshole,"Alright, so I need to share a situation that happened recently between my roommate, Alex, and me. We’ve been living together for about a year now, and for the most part, we get along really well. Alex is a great guy, but he has this habit that’s been driving me a little nuts.

To give you some context, I’m a pretty organized person. I like to keep our living space tidy, and I often do the dishes and other chores to keep everything in order. Alex, on the other hand, is a bit more laid-back about cleanliness. He sometimes leaves his dishes in the sink for a few days, and it doesn’t really bother him when clothes pile up in common areas.

I usually try to bring it up gently when his mess starts to pile up. A couple of weeks ago, after multiple reminders, I decided to just tackle the mess in the kitchen myself one Saturday. I cleaned up the dishes, wiped down the counters, and even organized the fridge a little. I thought it would be a nice surprise for him when he got home.

When Alex came back, he seemed really upset. He told me that he felt disrespected because I hadn’t talked to him about it first and just went ahead and cleaned up without consulting him. I explained that I was trying to keep our home nice, but he felt like I was undermining his space and not giving him a chance to clean up himself. I really didn’t mean to overstep; I just thought I was helping.

We ended up having a long conversation about boundaries and how we could communicate better about cleanliness. We both apologized for how we handled things. I didn’t realize he felt that way, and he acknowledged that he could do better about keeping the common areas tidy. 

In the end, we decided to create a cleaning schedule so we both knew what to expect. I feel like we both learned something from the situation and came out stronger as roommates.

However, our parents went through a rough patch a few years ago and decided to separate. After the separation, things got complicated. My brother took it very hard and started to rely heavily on me for emotional support, often calling me late at night to talk about how he was feeling.

I tried my best to be there for him, but eventually, it became overwhelming. I was dealing with my own emotions about the divorce, and balancing my work and social life while being his primary support started to take a toll on me. I had to set some boundaries, and I told him that while I care about him, I can’t always be available to talk. I suggested that he consider speaking with a therapist instead, as I thought it might help him more than just leaning on me.

That conversation didn’t go well. He felt hurt and said that I was abandoning him during a tough time. I was taken aback, but I stood by my decision to prioritize my mental health. A few weeks later, I noticed he was still upset and even had a talk with our parents about it.

No one is the Asshole,"I’m feeling a bit confused about a recent interaction I had, and I’d love some perspective on whether I was in the wrong or not. Here’s what happened:

A few days ago, I was at a local park enjoying a sunny afternoon. I brought a picnic blanket, some snacks, and my book to read. After finding a nice spot under a tree, I laid out my things and settled in. The park was pretty busy, with families and groups of friends scattered around.

About half an hour into my relaxing day, a woman and her little boy (maybe around 5 years old) set up their picnic just a few yards away from me. The boy seemed really excited and started running around, playing with a frisbee. After a while, he accidentally threw it in my direction, and it landed right next to my blanket.

I picked it up and called out to the mom, “Hey, I think this is your son’s!” She looked over and smiled, saying, “Oh, thank you!” She walked over to get it, and we exchanged a few friendly words about how busy the park was that day.

After that, I decided to take a quick break from my book and enjoy some snacks. I opened a bag of chips, and as I was munching away, the little boy came running back, clearly still in playful mode. He said, “Can I have some chips?” 

Now, I had a choice to make. I quickly assessed the situation. I didn’t mind sharing, but I also didn’t want to encourage him to think it was okay to take things from strangers. So I thought for a moment and then said, “You know what? Chips are a bit messy, and I’d rather keep them to myself, but I hope you enjoy your picnic!” 

He looked a bit disappointed but nodded understandingly. The mom, who had been watching the whole exchange, came over and thanked me for being honest. She explained that they were trying to teach him about asking before taking, which I appreciated. We ended up chatting a bit more, and it was a nice connection.

Later, though, I started to wonder if I could have handled that better. Maybe I should have offered him a couple of chips instead of just saying no. It felt like a harmless request from a kid, and I don't want to come off as overly rigid or unfriendly.

So, Reddit, AITA for not sharing my chips with a kid at the park?",502,2683,0.98,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_66211,2022-11-28 00:00:00,NAH,2195,AITA

I totally respect that, and I’ve been excited to support her during the planning process.

However, a few weeks ago, she called me in a panic because the venue she wanted was suddenly available for a larger guest list, and she was thinking about changing her plans to accommodate more people. She asked me what I thought, and I could hear the stress in her voice. I told her that I would support her no matter what she decided, but I also gently reminded her of her original vision for the wedding and how special it was for her.

After our conversation, I noticed she seemed even more conflicted, so I suggested she take a day to think about it and really reflect on what she wanted. I told her it was important to stay true to her vision and not feel pressured to accommodate everyone else. She thanked me for my honesty and said she would think about it. 

The next day, she decided to go with the larger guest list and mentioned that she felt relieved after making the decision. I felt a little guilty for not outright encouraging her to stick with her original plan, but I also understood that it was ultimately her choice to make.

However, my partner said he wanted to bring some meat options for himself, as he felt it would be more satisfying for him while we were hiking and active.

I was initially put off by the idea, as I thought it would contradict our shared values and felt uncomfortable cooking meat in our shared space. After discussing it, I realized that he was trying to find a balance between his own preferences and our shared goals. So, we compromised: I would prepare vegetarian meals for the two of us, and he could bring some pre-cooked meat that he would heat separately.

A few weeks ago, I was having a rough time and confided in Mike about some personal struggles and feelings I’ve been dealing with. I was feeling particularly down due to some family issues and work stress. Mike was supportive, as always, and listened to me vent.

However, I noticed that after I shared my feelings, he started to act differently around me. He became more distant, and I found out later that he mentioned our conversation to Sarah. I didn’t think much of it, but when I spoke to Mike again, he expressed concern that I might be developing feelings for him. I assured him that I don’t, and that I only see him as my best friend.

To clear the air, I suggested that we have a sit-down discussion about boundaries and our friendship, especially now that he’s in a relationship. I wanted to make sure that nothing would change between us, but Mike took it the wrong way. He thought I was trying to create drama and said that I was being overly sensitive. 

Honestly, I felt bad for bringing it up, but I just wanted to ensure that we could still be close friends without misunderstandings. I genuinely respect his relationship with Sarah and have no intentions of interfering. 

After that conversation, I’ve been feeling a bit awkward around him, and I’m not sure if I overstepped by wanting to talk things out. 

So, am I the asshole for wanting to discuss our friendship boundaries, or was Mike being too sensitive about my concerns?

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been together for about three years. We both have busy jobs, and after a long week, we look forward to our weekends together. However, I've noticed that my partner has been feeling overwhelmed with work lately, and I wanted to support them.

Last weekend, I planned a fun day out for us to unwind. I made brunch reservations at this cute café, and then I scheduled a visit to a local art exhibit. I thought it would be a nice break from our routine and a chance for us to relax together.

When I shared the plan with my partner, they seemed less than enthusiastic. They mentioned they’d rather have a quiet day at home to recharge instead of being out and about. I completely understood where they were coming from, but I felt disappointed because I had put effort into planning something special.

I tried to convince my partner to at least join me for brunch, saying that it would help them feel better and we could come back home afterward. I thought it was a compromise. However, they insisted that they just needed a day to themselves and didn’t want to go out at all.

In the heat of the moment, I said something along the lines of, “I just wanted to do something nice for us, but if you don’t care about that, fine.” I immediately regretted it because it came off as dismissive of their feelings, and their expression changed. They ended up going to their room to take a break.

After some time apart, I went to talk to them, and we ended up having a heartfelt conversation about our needs for leisure and rest. I realized that my insistence on going out was selfish at that moment, and my partner’s need for downtime was valid. We both apologized for how we handled the situation, and we decided to find a balance moving forward.

Now we’re working on communicating our needs better and trying to plan our weekends in a way that respects both our desires. I believe we both learned from this experience.

So, am I the asshole for wanting to plan a fun day and getting frustrated when my partner didn’t want to join?",145,2861,0.63,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_60661,2024-08-21 00:00:00,NAH,2045,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I (30f) recently started a new job at a marketing firm. I was excited to meet my colleagues and be part of a team. On my second week, a coworker, whom I'll call Mike, invited me to a casual after-work happy hour with some other team members. I thought it would be a great way to get to know everyone better, so I accepted.

At the bar, I found myself in a lively conversation with several people. The atmosphere was relaxed, and we were all joking around and sharing funny stories. At one point, I made a light-hearted joke about how my cooking skills are so bad that even my smoke alarm cheers me on when I attempt to cook. Everyone laughed, and it felt great to share a laugh.

However, I noticed that Mike seemed a bit uncomfortable with the banter. He eventually spoke up and said he preferred if we avoided making jokes about cooking or food because he had a sensitive relationship with it stemming from an eating disorder he had been in recovery from.

I immediately felt bad and apologized for not knowing. I assured him that I didn’t mean to offend and would be more mindful of the topics I joked about in the future. The group shifted the conversation to something else, and the rest of the night went smoothly.

Afterward, I felt conflicted. I wanted to be supportive of Mike, but I also realized that humor can sometimes be subjective, and I didn't intend to hurt anyone’s feelings. I spoke to a couple of other coworkers later, and they expressed that they appreciated my humor and didn't find it offensive, but they understood Mike’s point of view.

I genuinely didn’t mean any harm, but I wonder if I should have been more aware of his feelings beforehand. AITA for making the joke, or is it reasonable to expect people to communicate their sensitivities more directly?",959,881,0.92,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_40153,2020-05-23 00:00:00,NAH,1783,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I’ve always been really close with my sister, and we’ve shared a lot over the years. We’re both in our late twenties, and while we have our differences, we generally get along. Recently, she moved to a new city for work, and I couldn’t be happier for her. 

However, she’s been feeling a bit lonely in her new place and invited me to visit. I was excited about it and wanted to make the most of the trip, so I decided to surprise her by bringing along her best friend, who also recently moved to a different city. I thought it would be a fun reunion, and we could all spend time together.

I reached out to her best friend, and she was thrilled about the idea. I told her I’d coordinate with my sister to make it a true surprise. When I arrived at my sister’s place, she was genuinely shocked and overjoyed to see both me and her best friend. 

Things were going great until halfway through the visit when she expressed that she felt overwhelmed. She appreciated the surprise but admitted she was feeling pressured to entertain both of us and make sure we were having fun. It was clear she hadn’t anticipated having both of us there at the same time, and I could see that it was a lot for her to manage.

I felt bad because my intentions were purely to make her happy, but I ended up putting her in a position where she felt stressed instead. After some heart-to-heart discussions, we talked things through. She clarified that it wasn't that she didn’t want us there, but rather that she wasn’t prepared for the dynamics of having both of us in her space at once.

In the end, we had a good time, and I made sure to give her some space when she needed it. I apologized for not checking in with her about the surprise beforehand, and she appreciated that I had good intentions.

Now I’m left feeling a bit conflicted. I didn’t mean for her to feel overwhelmed or pressured, but at the same time, I wanted to create a joyful experience for her. It ended well, but I wonder if I should have approached the surprise differently or checked in with her first.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently started dating someone new, and everything has been going really well. We've been together for about a month, and we've shared some great moments. However, there's one thing that's been bothering me a little. My partner has a pet cat that is very attached to them, which is sweet, but the cat has a habit of jumping onto the bed and curling up between us whenever we're trying to be intimate. 

At first, I thought it was cute, but it started to feel like the cat was interrupting our moments together. I love animals, and I don't want to come off as insensitive, but I also want to create a comfortable space for both of us. So, I mentioned to my partner that it might be nice to keep the cat out of the bedroom during those times. They looked a bit taken aback and said the cat has always been allowed on the bed and it's part of their routine.

I completely understand their attachment to their pet and didn't want to hurt their feelings. I suggested that we could set up a cozy spot for the cat outside the bedroom so they wouldn't feel left out and we could have some uninterrupted time together. My partner seemed to think about it but didn't give me a definite answer. 

I just want to make sure we both feel comfortable while still respecting their bond with their cat. Am I wrong for wanting to make this adjustment, or should I just let it be? WIBTA if I insisted on keeping the cat out during intimate moments? 

Update: After thinking it over, I decided to approach the topic again in a gentle way. I told my partner that I really value our time together and just wanted to find a balance that respects both their relationship with their cat and our intimacy. My partner appreciated my honesty and agreed to try having the cat sleep in its own space during those times to see how it goes. We both feel good about the compromise, and I think it will help our relationship grow stronger!",110,1732,0.57,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_38441,2022-05-15 00:00:00,NAH,1908,AITA

I noticed a group of kids playing soccer, and they were really getting into it. At one point, the ball got kicked too hard and it flew right into my picnic area, knocking over my drink and spilling it everywhere.

I was a bit annoyed, but I understood that kids can get carried away. One of the kids, about ten years old, came over to apologize and offered to help clean up the mess. I appreciated his effort, and I told him it was alright, accidents happen. I even suggested they take a break and have some snacks from my picnic since I still had plenty of food.

The other kids in the group thought that was a great idea, and they all came over to share the snacks. The parents eventually noticed what was happening and came over to thank me for being so understanding. We ended up chatting and bonding over our favorite picnic foods while the kids enjoyed themselves.

Looking back, I felt good about how I handled the situation. I didn't get upset with the kids or their parents, and instead, turned it into a positive experience for everyone involved.

During the party, I tried to engage with everyone, but one of the guests, Sarah, made a snarky comment about my outfit that stung a bit. I laughed it off, but later on, when she continued to make little jabs, I decided to calmly address it. I told her, “Hey, I’m all for joking around, but I’m here to have fun, not to be put down. Can we keep it light?” 

She seemed taken aback and apologized, but the atmosphere got a bit tense after that. I felt bad for speaking up because it was Mark’s day, and I didn’t want to ruin the vibe. After a while, I noticed Mark looking uncomfortable too, trying to navigate between his friends and the growing tension.

At the end of the night, I approached Mark and apologized for any awkwardness, explaining that I just wanted to stand up for myself. He appreciated my honesty but mentioned that he didn’t want anyone to feel uncomfortable at his party. 

I think everyone was just trying to enjoy the party in their own way, and while I felt justified in addressing Sarah’s comments, I also realized that it’s tough to balance honesty with keeping the peace in social situations.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I recently started a small book club with some friends from college. We all have varying tastes in books, but we agreed to pick a different genre each month to keep things interesting. This month, I suggested we read a classic science fiction novel that I absolutely love. I thought it would be a great choice since it’s not only entertaining but also has deep themes that can spark some interesting discussions.

When we met to discuss the book, I was excited to hear everyone’s thoughts. However, one of my friends, Sarah, expressed that she really didn’t enjoy it and found it hard to get through. I could tell she was frustrated. She mentioned that she prefers more contemporary works and felt that the language and pacing of the classic were outdated and off-putting. I tried to engage her in conversation about what she didn’t like, but she seemed pretty set on her opinion.

As the discussion continued, I realized that other members of the group were either indifferent or also didn't enjoy the book as much as I had hoped. I felt kind of bad because I had really pushed for this book, thinking everyone would love it like I do. I tried to defend my choice by highlighting its significance in the genre, but that just made Sarah and a few others a bit more annoyed.

After the meeting, I reached out to Sarah to check in on her. She told me that she appreciated me wanting to share something I love, but she wished I had considered the group’s preferences more. I realized that while I was excited, I might have been a bit too pushy with my choice. We talked it out, and she understood that I just wanted to share something meaningful to me. 

I admitted that I might have prioritized my own tastes a bit too much and promised to be more considerate in the future. We both agreed that it’s important for everyone to feel included in the book selection process.

No one is the Asshole,"I have a friend, “Josh,” who is a huge sports fan. He’s always talking about his favorite teams, and he even has a dedicated space in his living room for memorabilia. I’m not really into sports at all, but I enjoy hanging out with Josh because he’s a great guy and we have a lot in common outside of sports.

A couple of weeks ago, Josh invited a few friends over for a game night while his favorite team was playing on TV. He was really excited about it, and I didn’t want to be a downer, so I agreed to come along. I figured I’d just enjoy the snacks and the company, even if I wasn’t into the game.

When I arrived, I noticed that the room was decorated with team colors and banners. I thought it was a bit over the top, but it made Josh happy, so I didn’t say anything. As the game went on, I tried to engage a bit. I asked him questions about the players and the rules, but I could tell he was getting frustrated with my lack of knowledge.

At one point, Josh got really into a play, and I jokingly pretended to be super excited about a random play—like I was genuinely cheering for his team. I thought it would make him laugh, but instead, he looked at me with annoyance and said, “It’s not funny if you don’t even know what’s going on.” I didn’t mean to upset him; I just wanted to lighten the mood.

After that, things got a bit tense. I tried to stay engaged without pretending to care too much, but Josh kept bringing up sports-related topics, and I felt out of place. Eventually, I just sat back and silently munched on snacks. 

After the game, Josh mentioned to me that I should’ve just been honest about not being into sports instead of pretending. I told him I was only trying to have fun and support him, but he felt like I was making a joke out of something he really cared about.

I told this story to another friend, and they said that I was being inconsiderate by joking about something that means a lot to Josh.

No one is the Asshole,"I am 32 and recently went through a tough breakup with my long-term girlfriend. We had been together for five years, but we realized that we were growing apart and had different life goals. While it was mutual and amicable, it still hurt a lot, and I found myself feeling quite lost for a while.

About a month after the breakup, I met up with a close friend, Sarah, whom I hadn’t seen in ages. We used to hang out a lot in college, but life got busy, and we lost touch. We had a great night catching up, reminiscing about old times, and sharing where we were in life now. It was refreshing, and I felt a connection rekindle between us.

Over the next few weeks, we started hanging out more frequently. She was supportive of my breakup and really encouraged me to talk about my feelings. I found myself opening up to her about my struggles, and she shared her own challenges too, which developed our friendship even deeper.

However, I began to notice that I was developing feelings for her, which made me uneasy. I didn’t want to jeopardize our friendship, and I was still processing my breakup. I decided to have an honest conversation with Sarah about my feelings. I let her know that I valued our friendship and didn’t want to rush into anything, especially since I was still healing.

She appreciated my honesty and admitted she had also felt a spark between us but was hesitant because of my recent breakup. We talked about taking things slow and just enjoying each other’s company without any pressure. It felt good to be on the same page.

A few weeks later, we attended a mutual friend’s birthday party together. I enjoyed spending time with her, and we ended up sharing a kiss. It felt natural and right, but I still had that nagging worry about whether I was moving on too quickly.

After the party, I brought it up with Sarah again. I told her that while I enjoyed our connection, I wanted to ensure we were both ready for this and that it didn’t complicate our friendship. We agreed to take it slow and see where things go, keeping communication open.

Now, I’m feeling more positive about this new chapter. I still think about my ex sometimes, but I also see the potential for something meaningful with Sarah. It’s a delicate balance, and I hope I’m handling it respectfully.

Last week, I noticed that our fridge was overflowing with food. We both tend to grocery shop weekly, but it seemed like we were buying too much of the same things and not eating them before they expired. I suggested that we try meal prepping together to make sure we used up what we had and to save money. I was really excited about the idea and thought it would be fun to bond over cooking.

However, my roommate wasn’t on board. She got defensive and said that she liked having the freedom to cook what she wanted when she wanted, and she felt like I was trying to control her. I didn’t mean to come off as controlling; I just thought it would be a practical solution to reduce waste and save us both some cash. I apologized for making her feel that way and tried to explain my perspective, but she seemed really hurt.

After thinking about it, I decided to back off. I didn’t want to push her into something she wasn’t comfortable with.

I also made an effort to clean up after myself more thoroughly, in case that was part of her frustration.

Jake was supportive at first, even asking to see my paintings, but it seemed like he was growing increasingly frustrated.

To make things right, I suggested we set aside one night a week just for us to hang out without distractions. I also invited him to join me in painting, thinking it might be a fun way for us to spend time together. However, he didn’t seem interested, saying he wasn’t really into art. 

After a few weeks of this, I noticed Jake started venting to other friends about how I was ""too focused on my art"" and was ""losing touch"" with him.

As I was unloading the groceries, she came out to greet me and thanked me for my service. She seemed cheerful but also a bit overwhelmed.

The issue arose when one of my friends, Jamie, who is known for being a bit of a control freak, decided to take over the planning. While we all contributed ideas, Jamie insisted on organizing everything down to the minute. A few of us including myself tried to suggest some changes, like splitting the cooking duties or having some free time to explore, but Jamie shot down every suggestion, saying that we had to stick to ""the schedule."" 

As the weekend approached, I was feeling pretty stressed and frustrated with how tightly controlled everything felt. I didn’t want to ruin the trip, so I tried to keep my mouth shut. However, when we got there, Jamie’s behavior became even more intense.

In a moment of frustration, I snapped at Jamie and told them that not everything needed to be so meticulously planned, and that we should be able to go with the flow a little. This led to an argument, and soon enough, everyone was involved. Friends were taking sides, and it ended up turning into a big fight that overshadowed the entire trip.

No one is the Asshole,"I'm a 28f and I have a close friend, 29m, who recently went through a tough breakup. We've been friends for years, and I always try to be there for him during difficult times. He’s been really down lately, and I’m worried about him.

Last week, I invited him over for dinner to cheer him up. I cooked his favorite meal and we ended up talking about everything that had been going on in his life. I could see he was really struggling to cope, so I tried to offer some encouragement and support.

During our conversation, I made a comment about how I felt like he had so much potential and that I believed he would find someone great again. I mentioned that he’s funny, smart, and attractive, and that he just needs to get back out there. I didn't think much of it, but he suddenly went quiet and seemed really uncomfortable. I asked if he was okay, and he told me that comments like that remind him of his ex and make him feel worse.

I felt terrible and immediately apologized, saying I didn’t mean to upset him and that I was just trying to be supportive. I reassured him that I was there for him and would never want to make him feel bad. He seemed to accept my apology, but the atmosphere was still awkward for the rest of the evening.

I’ve been reflecting on the situation, wondering if I overstepped by trying to encourage him. I genuinely thought I was being a good friend, but now I'm worried that I might have put my foot in my mouth. Did I cross a line, or was I just trying to help?

No one is the Asshole,"My English is not perfect, but I’ll do my best to explain my situation. I have been married to my husband for 10 years, and we have two kids, ages 7 and 4. Recently, my husband’s mother, whom I’ll call Linda, has been trying to be very involved in our lives, which is a bit overwhelming.

Linda has always been a caring grandmother, but ever since we moved back to our hometown, she seems to think that she should be heavily involved in our day-to-day parenting. She calls multiple times a week, asking for updates on the kids, and offers unsolicited advice on everything from discipline to education. While I appreciate her concern, it can feel intrusive at times, especially when I feel like I’m being second-guessed as a parent.

A few weeks ago, she suggested that we should let her take the kids for an entire weekend every month. At first, I thought it was a nice gesture, but I realized that my kids and I enjoy our family time together on weekends. I also worry that my kids might start to prefer being with Grandma over us if they see her too often.

I talked to my husband about it, and he understands where I’m coming from. However, he feels that it might hurt Linda’s feelings if we decline her offer for weekend visits. I don’t want to cause any family drama, but I also don’t want to compromise our family time. 

So now I’m in a bit of a dilemma. Would I be the asshole for asking Linda to tone down her involvement and not push for weekend visits, even though her intentions are good?",10,2465,0.83,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_77018,2024-03-01 00:00:00,NAH,1500,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Last month, my younger brother, Jake, moved in with me after a rough breakup. He was going through a tough time emotionally and needed a supportive environment. I was happy to help him out at first, but things quickly became overwhelming. 

Jake started to rely on me for everything—he would ask me to cook for him, to take him grocery shopping, and even to listen to him vent about his ex every night. I tried to be there for him, but I was also working long hours, and I have my own responsibilities to manage. I felt like I was losing my own sense of routine and well-being. 

One evening, after a long day at work, I came home to find Jake sitting on the couch, tears streaming down his face. He told me he felt like he would never be happy again and that he didn't know what to do with himself. I offered him some comfort, but by then, I was feeling burnt out. I suggested that he might benefit from talking to a therapist, but he brushed it off, saying he didn't want to burden anyone else with his problems.

A couple of days later, he asked if I could help him apply for jobs since he was feeling low on motivation. I felt guilty but told him I couldn’t do that right then because I had my own work to catch up on. He got upset and accused me of not caring about him. That hurt, but I realized I needed to set some boundaries for my own mental health. 

I decided to have an honest conversation with him, explaining that while I wanted to support him, I also needed him to take steps to help himself, like seeking professional help or trying to regain some independence. I told him I was always there for him, but I couldn’t be his sole source of support. He seemed to understand, and we talked it out without any lingering resentment.

Now, he’s looking into therapy and trying to pick up some freelance work, and I feel like we’re both in a better place. I’m relieved that I stood firm on my boundaries, but I still worry whether I was too harsh in my approach.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I need some advice on a situation that's been brewing in my friend group.

We have a close-knit group of friends, and we often get together for game nights. Recently, we decided to host a big game night at my place and invited everyone. I have a decent-sized living room, but it's definitely not huge.

A few days before the event, one of my friends, who has a tendency to be a bit loud and boisterous, mentioned that he was planning to bring his new girlfriend. This is great, but I know from experience that when he gets together with her, they tend to be really animated and take up a lot of space, both physically and with their energy.

I casually mentioned to my friend that I was concerned about the noise level since I didn’t want to disturb my neighbors. I suggested maybe they could hang out in the kitchen or another room if things got too loud. He seemed a bit put off by my suggestion and said I was being too controlling.

Now, I feel kind of bad for even bringing it up, but I also don’t want to deal with neighbors complaining or the party getting out of hand. I value our friend group and want everyone to have a good time, but I also want to maintain some level of comfort in my home.

While I was waiting for my order, I noticed a woman at the next table who seemed to be having a rough day. She was trying to work on her laptop, but her screen was shattered, and she was visibly frustrated.

When my order was ready, I noticed she sighed and put her head in her hands. I thought it might brighten her day a little if I offered to buy her a coffee. So, I approached her and said, ""Hey, I couldn't help but notice you're having a rough time. Can I buy you a coffee?"" She looked surprised and grateful, so I ordered her a cappuccino.

After I paid, I sat back down to wait for it. While I was waiting, I overheard a conversation she was having with a friend on the phone about how her laptop was her only means of working. When my drink was ready, I handed her the cappuccino and wished her a better day. She thanked me profusely.

However, when I got home, my partner was upset with me. She said I should have asked if the woman needed help with her broken laptop or at least offered to help with whatever she was working on. She felt I was a bit inconsiderate for not doing more. I explained that I just wanted to do a small, kind gesture and that I didn't want to pry into her personal situation.

Now I'm left wondering if I should have done more or if my kindness was enough as it was. Was I wrong to just buy her coffee and walk away? Am I the asshole for not offering further assistance?",558,2036,0.87,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_65242,2020-08-09 00:00:00,NAH,1538,AITA

One of my roommates, Alex, has a cat named Luna who is super sweet but also has some behavioral issues. She tends to scratch and bite when she gets overstimulated, and I’ve learned to be cautious around her.

Last week, I was studying in the living room when Luna jumped onto my lap. I was busy and didn’t really want her there, but I petted her for a bit. As I was trying to push her off gently so I could focus, she nipped at my hand. I yelped and instinctively swatted her away. I didn’t hit her hard, just a gentle push, but Alex saw it happen and freaked out.

He told me I was being cruel and that I should be more patient with her, especially since she’s had a rough past. I felt terrible because I didn’t mean to hurt her or scare him. I tried to explain that I was just startled and didn’t mean to react that way. Alex said that I should just let the cat do what she wants and that I have to accept her quirks.

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I live in a small apartment complex with six units. Recently, we had a new neighbor move in, and I noticed that he seemed a bit reserved and kept to himself. I wanted to be friendly, so I baked some cookies and brought them over as a welcome gift.

When I knocked on his door, he opened it a crack and hesitantly accepted the cookies. He thanked me, but I could tell he was uncomfortable. I made some small talk, asking if he needed help settling in or if he had any questions about the building. He politely declined and mentioned he preferred to keep to himself, which I respected.

A few days later, I saw him in the hallway and tried to wave and say hello. He seemed startled and quickly walked past me without responding. I thought maybe he was just having a rough day, so I didn’t think much of it at the time.

However, later that week, I overheard some of the other neighbors discussing my attempts to be friendly with him. They suggested that I might be coming on too strong and that he might be introverted or have social anxiety. One neighbor even mentioned that they had a similar experience with him and decided to give him space after realizing he wasn’t interested in socializing.

After hearing this, I felt a bit embarrassed. I genuinely just wanted to be nice, but I didn't want to make him feel uncomfortable. I decided to back off and let him be, but it left me wondering if I had unintentionally overstepped or if I could have approached the situation differently.

My partner thinks I was just being friendly and that there’s no harm in trying to get to know a neighbor, but I can’t shake the feeling that perhaps I misjudged the situation.

Max and Luna have had a rocky relationship since the beginning. Max is very playful and energetic, while Luna is more reserved and can be easily stressed. 

Recently, we decided to move in together to a new place, and I thought it would be a good opportunity to help Max and Luna get along better. I suggested that we try some gradual introductions, keeping them separated at first and then slowly allowing them to interact while supervised. My partner agreed, and we set up a plan.

However, during one of the introduction sessions, things went south. Max got a little too excited and chased Luna, causing her to hiss and run under the couch. My partner got really upset and blamed me for not controlling Max better, saying that I should have known how to handle him in that situation. I felt hurt because I thought we had agreed to this approach and I was trying my best.

After a tense discussion, we both realized we were just trying to do what was best for our pets, and it led to some misunderstandings. We apologized to each other and agreed to take things slower with the introductions and to communicate better about our pets' needs.

I love both Max and Luna, and I want them to be happy together, but I also feel like my partner and I need to be on the same page when it comes to handling them.

He seemed overly controlling, making comments about what she should wear and who she should hang out with. I tried to bring it up casually, thinking maybe I was just being paranoid. I didn’t want to come off as a jealous friend, but I genuinely cared about her well-being.

One evening, Sarah invited me over to hang out with her and her boyfriend, Brian. During the night, I noticed him making several dismissive remarks towards her, and it started to get under my skin. I couldn’t help but get a little confrontational. I told him that I thought he was being a bit harsh and that she deserves to be treated with respect. Sarah looked really uncomfortable, and I instantly regretted saying anything.

I apologized for overstepping, explaining that I just wanted what was best for her.

While we were decorating, Sarah found a box of old photographs of her grandmother and suggested we display them at the party. I thought this was a wonderful idea, so I helped her sort through the pictures and pick out the best ones.

However, while going through the box, I noticed a photo of Sarah’s grandmother from her youth that really struck me. It was a beautiful picture, and I casually mentioned how stunning her grandmother looked in it. Sarah seemed to get a bit quiet and asked if I could not display that particular photo, as it was a sensitive memory for her family because her grandmother had faced some hard times during that period.

I immediately felt bad and apologized for not knowing. I assured her I wouldn’t use that photo. Later, during the party, I noticed that Sarah's mood seemed off.

A few days ago, I took my younger sister, who is 12, to a local art fair. She’s been really interested in painting and wanted to get some inspiration from the artists there. I thought it would be a fun day, and I was excited to share that experience with her. 

When we arrived, the fair was packed, and there were various booths selling art, crafts, and food. We wandered around and even participated in a small painting workshop. My sister was having a blast, and I was so happy to see her enjoying herself. 

As we moved from one booth to another, we came across this one artist who was displaying some beautiful paintings. My sister was captivated and wanted to buy a small piece. She had saved up some of her birthday money, and I encouraged her to go for it. However, while we were discussing her purchase with the artist, I overheard another family nearby who seemed to be having a somewhat tense conversation.

They were visibly frustrated, and the kids in the family looked really disappointed. I felt bad for them, especially since it was supposed to be a fun day for everyone.

At that moment, I made the decision to approach the family and offered to help them out. I suggested they could use the small table that my sister and I had been using for our art supplies, and we could share the space. I thought it would be nice to help out and maybe even make some new friends.

The family was grateful for the gesture, and we spent the next couple of hours together, chatting and sharing stories about our art. My sister was thrilled because she got to show her paintings to the family, and they even encouraged her to keep pursuing her passion.

The family was enthusiastic about their art, and while I wanted to support them, I also wanted my sister to feel celebrated for her work.

At one point during dinner, Sarah made a comment about how important it was to be mindful of dietary restrictions, especially in social settings. I agreed, but I also mentioned that it’s tough to please everyone, especially when people have different needs. This led to a bit of a back-and-forth where Sarah felt that I was downplaying her concerns. I didn’t mean to offend her; I was just trying to express that it’s a challenge to accommodate everyone.

No one is the Asshole,"A little background: I work as a graphic designer in a small agency, and we’ve recently undergone a significant project that required all hands on deck. My colleague, Sarah, has been with the company for about a year, and we've developed a decent working relationship. 

A few weeks ago, Sarah approached me to ask for help with her portion of the project. She was feeling overwhelmed with the workload, and I could see she was stressed. I agreed to assist her, but I had my own deadlines to meet as well. I spent a couple of evenings helping her out, sharing design tips, and brainstorming ideas.

After we completed the project, Sarah suggested that we celebrate our success with a small get-together at her place, inviting a few other coworkers. I thought it sounded fun, so I agreed. However, when I arrived at her apartment, I quickly realized that the gathering was more of a party than I had anticipated, with drinks and loud music. 

While I enjoyed the atmosphere, I felt a bit out of place since I tend to prefer quieter, more intimate gatherings. I noticed that Sarah had invited a few people who seemed to be more than just coworkers, and they were all having a great time. I started to feel uncomfortable and decided to leave after a couple of hours.

Later that week, I overheard Sarah discussing the gathering with another colleague, and she mentioned feeling like I didn’t enjoy myself. I didn't want her to think I didn’t appreciate her effort, but I also didn't know how to express my feelings without making her feel bad. 

Now I'm wondering if I should have been more open with her about my discomfort or if it was reasonable to just leave when I felt out of place. I don't want her to think poorly of me or feel like I don't value our working relationship. 

EDIT: I’ve spoken to a few friends about this, and they suggested that I could reach out to Sarah and let her know that I appreciated her inviting me, but that big gatherings aren’t really my thing. I think I’ll do that to clear the air. It’s important for me to maintain a good working relationship and be honest about my feelings without hurting her.",150,1956,0.84,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_71923,2019-01-15 00:00:00,NAH,2132,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I (30M) have a younger sister (25F) who has always been a free spirit. She's adventurous and often travels to different countries for months at a time. Recently, she returned from a trip to South America and announced that she was getting serious with a guy she met there. I’ll call him ""Diego.""

Diego is an amazing person, but he has a very different lifestyle than what our family is used to. He’s from a rural area and has a passion for living off the land. He’s planning to move back to South America to start a farming project, and my sister wants to go with him. She’s excited about the idea of living a simple life and connecting with nature.

While I support her independence and desire for adventure, I'm genuinely worried about her decision. I voiced my concerns to her, explaining that living in a rural area with limited access to healthcare, education, and resources might not be the best choice, especially since she’s always lived in urban settings. I also mentioned that she might face challenges adjusting to a life that’s so different from what she’s known.

My sister got upset and said that I was being overprotective and that she was an adult capable of making her own choices. I didn’t mean to come off as controlling; I just want what’s best for her. I tried to explain that my worries came from a place of love, but she felt like I was dismissing her dreams.

Ultimately, I respect her decision, but I can't shake off the feeling that she might be jumping into something without fully thinking it through.

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I recently went through a tough situation concerning our holiday plans. We're both 30, and we’ve been together for about five years. Every year, we usually spend the holidays with my family, which is a tradition I cherish. My family is quite large and lively, and the holidays are a time for us to come together and celebrate.

This year, however, my partner expressed a strong desire to spend the holidays with their family instead. They are a bit estranged from their family, and they felt that this would be an opportunity to reconnect. I completely understood their feelings and recognized that it was important for them to have this time.

Initially, I was excited about the idea of spending the holidays with their family, but as the date approached, I started feeling anxious about not being with my own family. I brought this up to my partner, expressing that it would be hard for me to miss out on my family’s traditions. They were understanding but mentioned that they really wanted to give their family a chance. We both were in a tough spot, wanting to support each other but also feeling the weight of our own family expectations.

After some back and forth, we decided to split the holidays: we would spend Christmas Eve with my family and then travel to their family for Christmas Day. It felt like a good compromise. However, when we shared this plan with our families, both sides had mixed reactions. My family felt disappointed that we wouldn’t be there for the entire holiday, and my partner’s family felt like we were rushing through the visit.

Now, my partner feels guilty for upsetting my family, and I feel guilty for not fully committing to either side. We both tried to make the best decision we could, but it's led to some lingering tension. I’m wondering if I handled this situation poorly.

Recently, Alex and I decided to take a weekend trip to a nearby amusement park. We thought it would be a fun bonding experience for everyone. On the first day, while we were waiting in line for a ride, Noah turned to me and said, ""Mom, can I get a snack after this?"" I paused, a little surprised, and smiled, but I felt it was important to clarify. 

I said, ""You can call me [Your Name], buddy. I know I’m not your mom, and I want to make sure you feel comfortable."" Noah looked a bit confused, but he nodded. Alex later told me they had a conversation about it, and Noah expressed that he just thought of me as a second mom because of how close we all are.

Later that night, I spoke with Alex about whether I overstepped. I explained that while I cherish our family dynamic, I didn't want to take anything away from Noah's relationship with his mom. Alex understood my point of view but also felt that it's okay for Noah to see me as a mother figure in his life.

I’m wondering if I was wrong to address the situation in the first place. AITA for suggesting that Noah should call me by my name instead of “mom”?

Recently, she decided to host a small gathering for her friends to show off her garden and share some homemade dishes. She asked me to bring a dessert, and I happily agreed.

I’m not the best baker, but I have a go-to recipe for chocolate chip cookies that everyone loves. The night before the gathering, I made a big batch and even added a little sea salt to elevate the flavor. When I arrived at Sarah's place, she was excited to see the cookies and said they smelled amazing.

As the evening went on, I noticed that Sarah seemed a little off. She eventually confided in me that she had been feeling really anxious about her garden. A few weeks ago, she had planted some new flowers, and she was worried they wouldn’t survive the upcoming frost. She had been checking the weather obsessively and felt overwhelmed trying to protect her plants.

I wanted to cheer her up, so I suggested we take a break from the party and go check on the flowers together. She agreed, and we stepped outside for a few minutes. I reassured her that she had done a great job with the garden, and we spent some time just enjoying the beauty of what she had created. 

When we returned to the gathering, Sarah thanked me for being there for her, and she looked a bit more relaxed. Everyone enjoyed the cookies, and I felt glad to have supported my friend.

However, some of our other friends thought it was strange that I had interrupted the party for what seemed like a minor concern. They expressed that I could have waited until later to check on her flowers. I understand their point, but I also felt that supporting a friend in need was worth it.

In the end, no one was really upset, but there was some light-hearted debate about whether I overstepped by taking Sarah away from her guests. I don’t think anyone was wrong, but I’m curious to hear what others think.",279,646,0.7,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_49588,2022-03-25 00:00:00,NAH,1959,AITA

She had planned a surprise birthday party for her husband, and the only date that worked for everyone was the exact weekend of our anniversary. She begged me to come, explaining how much it would mean to her and that her husband would be heartbroken if we didn’t attend. I felt really torn because I didn’t want to let my sister down, but I also didn’t want to ruin our anniversary plans.

After a lot of back and forth, my partner and I decided to go to the party but only for a few hours, and then leave for our trip late that same evening. I talked to my sister about it, and she understood, saying she just wanted us to make an appearance.

So, on the day of the party, we went, and it was actually a really nice time. We helped with the setup, celebrated with my brother-in-law, and then left for our cabin around 8 PM. Although it wasn't what we initially planned, it ended up being a good compromise.

Emily is a nice person, but she can be really controlling. She’s been trying to isolate Jake from his friends, including me. Jake often cancels our plans to hang out with her, and when we do hang out, she’s always there, making it awkward.

One evening, I decided to talk to Jake about it. I expressed my concerns about how Emily was influencing him and asked if he felt like he was missing out on our friendship. Jake got defensive and said that he loves spending time with Emily and that I need to respect his choices.

So, a couple of weeks ago, I (28F) went to a local coffee shop to get some work done on my laptop. It was one of those cozy places where people usually come to relax, work, or chat. As I sat down, I noticed a group of college students at a nearby table who seemed to be working on a project together. They were lively and laughing, which made the atmosphere nice. 

After a while, I overheard them talking about a class project that seemed to be stressing them out. I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I couldn't help but hear them mention they were struggling with some concepts.

I offered to help them if they wanted. They seemed surprised but also relieved and thankful for the offer.

We ended up spending a couple of hours working together. I helped clarify some concepts and provided some resources they could use. They were really appreciative, and I was happy to help them out. As we were wrapping up, one of the students joked that I should come back the next week to help them with their final presentation, and they all laughed. I said I would be happy to help if I had the time, but I didn’t want to impose.

B has been going through a tough time with his family, which I understand can be overwhelming. He often takes longer breaks than usual at work and sometimes shows up late or leaves early without much explanation. While I completely empathize with what he’s going through, I’ve noticed that his behavior has started to affect our team’s workload.

For instance, we had a project deadline approaching, and I was counting on B to complete his portion. The day before it was due, he informed me that he hadn’t finished because he was feeling ""really low"" that week and needed to take more time for himself. I offered to help him with his work, but he declined, saying he wanted to do it on his own terms. I get that he might need that space, but it left the rest of us scrambling to pick up the slack.

In another instance, during a team meeting, B seemed disengaged and kept zoning out. It was noticeable, and I tried to bring him back into the conversation, but he just brushed it off. I felt uncomfortable calling him out in front of everyone because I didn’t want to exacerbate what he’s already dealing with.

He’ll often ask me to join in or for tips, and while I don’t mind helping him, it’s starting to feel a bit one-sided. 

Last weekend, he was playing a game online with his friends, and when he lost, he got really upset. He asked me to play for him just to prove to his friends that he could win. I told him that I’d be happy to play with him, but I didn’t think it was fair for me to play his game while he just sat back. I encouraged him to try again and work through the challenge himself. He got really frustrated and accused me of not wanting to help him. 

I understand that he’s still learning and getting upset is part of it, but I also want him to develop his own skills and confidence. I feel bad for not jumping in to help him right then, but I also feel like it’s important for him to learn to face challenges on his own. 

My mom overheard our argument and said I should have just played for him, because it would have made him happy. Now I’m feeling guilty for putting my foot down. Was I wrong for wanting him to solve his own problems and not just rely on me?

No one is the Asshole,"I’ve been part of a book club with a group of friends for a couple of years now. We meet monthly to discuss a chosen book and share snacks. Recently, we decided to do a themed potluck for our next meeting, where everyone would bring a dish that relates to the book we were reading.

I had a busy week and didn’t have time to cook anything intricate. I decided to bring a simple dessert, a store-bought cake, thinking it would be a nice treat. I let the group know in advance that I’d be bringing it.

When the day of the meeting arrived, I brought the cake along, and everyone seemed excited. However, one of the members, Lisa, who is known for her amazing baking skills, expressed disappointment that I didn't make something homemade. She felt that store-bought items were not in the spirit of our potluck theme.

I understood where she was coming from, but I also felt like I shouldn’t be criticized for my choice, especially since I had informed everyone ahead of time. During the meeting, I tried to keep the mood light and suggested that we all enjoy the cake together, regardless of its origin. 

In the end, everyone enjoyed the cake, but Lisa didn’t seem to get over her disappointment and continued to make comments about homemade vs. store-bought throughout the night. I felt a bit awkward but didn’t want to escalate things further.

A couple of weeks later, Lisa reached out to me privately, apologizing for her comments and explaining that she was just having a rough week. We both agreed that it was a misunderstanding and decided to move forward.

When I arrived, I noticed she had made a recipe that I had shared with her a while back. I thought it was great that she was trying it out, but when I tasted it, I felt it was underseasoned. I mentioned that I thought it could use a bit more salt and some herbs, and she seemed taken aback. She explained that she wanted to follow the recipe exactly as it was written because she wanted to do it “right.” I understood her perspective but felt that cooking is also about personal taste and adjustments.

After a brief discussion, I suggested that next time she could experiment a bit more with flavors. I didn’t mean to come off as critical, but I think I may have made her feel like she wasn’t a good cook. She got quiet for the rest of the dinner, and I could tell I had hurt her feelings.

They’re great kids, but they can get pretty loud, especially when they're playing video games or having friends over. I work from home, and there have been several times where I’ve been on important calls when the noise level spikes, making it really hard for me to concentrate.

The other day, I was on a video call with a client and the kids were playing a particularly intense game, which escalated into lots of shouting and laughter. I was worried it would reflect badly on me, so I decided to step out onto my front porch and talk to them from there. I politely asked if they could keep the volume down a bit, especially during weekday afternoons when I have calls. 

The mom came out soon after and seemed a bit defensive, saying she was trying her best to manage her kids but sometimes it just gets loud. I felt bad for putting her in that position, and I honestly didn’t mean to come off as rude or demanding. We ended up having a decent conversation, and I assured her that I understood kids need to have fun.

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I recently had a disagreement about how to handle our shared living space regarding a pet we adopted together. We got a small dog about six months ago, and while I absolutely adore him, I’ve noticed that my partner has been struggling with the responsibilities of pet ownership.

I’m currently working from home, which gives me the flexibility to take care of our dog during the day. My partner, however, is working long hours at a job that doesn't allow for breaks. I’ve been the primary caretaker, taking him for walks, feeding him, and ensuring he gets plenty of playtime.

A couple of weeks ago, my partner asked if we could start crate training the dog, as they had read that it might help with his anxiety. I was hesitant because the dog had previously had a rough start and I felt that crating him for extended periods might exacerbate his anxiety. I proposed that we could work on this together, gradually introducing crating while making sure he wasn't confined for too long, especially since I was home most of the time. My partner agreed but mentioned they would like to start immediately.

One evening, after a long day of work, my partner decided to crate the dog while they took a quick shower. I was in the other room and didn’t realize they had done this until I heard the dog whimpering. It broke my heart, and I rushed in to let him out. My partner was surprised and a bit upset that I had intervened. They felt that I was undermining their decision and not respecting their authority as a co-owner.

We ended up having a long discussion about our differing views on pet care. I really want to be a team in this, but I also feel a strong responsibility towards our dog’s well-being. My partner, on the other hand, was feeling overwhelmed and just wanted to establish some structure for the dog.

In the end, we both apologized for how we handled the situation. I realized that my partner is trying their best, even if their approach is different from mine. We agreed to communicate more openly about decisions regarding the dog and to compromise on our training methods.

So, AITA for letting the dog out of the crate when he was whimpering, or was my partner too harsh in wanting to crate train him immediately?

One of my friends, Sarah (27F), has been struggling financially lately and has been open about it. We all care about her, and I often offer to cover her share when we go out, but she always insists on paying me back.

Last week, we decided to go out for dinner to celebrate someone’s promotion. Sarah mentioned she was feeling really stressed about money, so when the bill came, I offered to cover her portion again, emphasizing that I didn’t mind at all and wanted her to enjoy the night without worrying. She hesitated but finally accepted, saying thank you and that she appreciated it.

However, when we were leaving, I overheard Sarah talking to another friend about how she felt embarrassed that I was always paying for her meals and that it made her feel like a charity case. I didn’t mean for it to come across that way, and I thought I was being supportive by helping her out. I felt a bit hurt that she was uncomfortable with my offer, but I also understand her feelings.

I wanted to ask her directly if she would prefer that I stop offering to cover her meal, or if there was a way for us to make it more comfortable, but I didn’t want to put her on the spot. I talked to another mutual friend about it, and she said I was trying to be kind, but I should be mindful of how Sarah might perceive it.

I’ve been trying to support her as much as I can, but I also have my own struggles with stress from work and personal issues.

One day, Mia reached out to me and asked if I could help her with a project she had for school. I was already feeling pretty drained, but I didn’t want to let her down, so I agreed to help her. We set a date for the weekend to work on it together.

As the weekend approached, I realized that I had a ton of work to catch up on and was feeling really anxious about it. I know Mia needs support, but I also need to take care of my own mental health. So, the day before we were supposed to meet, I texted her and said, “Hey, I’m really sorry, but I’m feeling really overwhelmed with work right now. Can we reschedule for another time?”

Mia was understanding but seemed a bit disappointed. I felt guilty for not being there for her, but I also knew I needed to prioritize my mental health.

Later, I texted her again to suggest a different day and offered to help her even more once I had a handle on my own stuff. She appreciated that but I still felt bad about canceling.

No one is the Asshole,"Throwaway account because I don't want my friends to see this.

So I’m a 27F and my younger brother, 22M, just graduated from college. When he was in his final year, my parents decided to go on a big vacation to celebrate his graduation and also to take some time for themselves. They planned a trip for about two weeks to Europe and were really excited about it.

Here's where the issue comes in: my brother, who has always been a bit reckless with money, ended up in a tough spot. He had a couple of unexpected expenses right before graduation and was stressing about how to afford the trip. I offered to help him out because I had some savings and I thought it would be nice for us to enjoy this experience together as a family. I told him I'd cover his share of the trip, but he needed to pay me back after he started working.

Fast forward to the trip itself, and he was having a blast. I was happy to see him enjoying himself, but I noticed he was spending money on things like fancy dinners and souvenirs, which made me feel a bit used. I brought it up casually one evening, asking him if he was planning on sticking to our agreement. He brushed it off, saying he’d pay me back once he got a job, and that I should just enjoy the trip without worrying about it. I let it go for a few more days, but it was eating at me.

Eventually, I confronted him more seriously about it, and he got defensive. He said that I was ruining the trip for him by worrying about money, and that I should just be happy for him. I felt guilty for bringing it up, but I also felt like he wasn’t taking our agreement seriously. I tried to explain my point of view, but it turned into a heated argument.

By the end of the trip, the atmosphere between us was tense, and I felt bad for ruining what was supposed to be a celebratory time. I still believe that I had the right to express my feelings about the money, but I also understand that it might have been better to wait until we were back home. 

TL;DR: I offered to pay for my brother's trip under the condition he would pay me back, but when I brought up the topic during the trip, it led to an argument and some tension. Now I'm wondering if I was in the wrong for addressing money concerns while we were supposed to be celebrating his graduation.",627,878,0.65,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_64198,2024-02-25 00:00:00,NAH,2287,AITA

One day, the center was hosting a potluck, and everyone was encouraged to bring a dish to share. I decided to make a large salad and brought it with me to the event.

When I arrived, I noticed that a few people were already setting up their dishes on the tables. One woman, who seemed a bit overwhelmed, was struggling with a large casserole dish. I offered to help her set it up, and we started chatting. Her name was Sarah, and she explained that she was new to the area too and was trying to make connections.

As more people arrived, I noticed that the tables were getting crowded, and there wasn’t a lot of space left for my salad. I approached the organizers and asked if there was an extra table I could use. They said there was a small folding table in the back that I could set up. 

I took my salad back there, and while I was arranging it, I overheard some people near the main table discussing the layout. It turned out that the organizers were planning to move everything outside since the weather was nice, and they wanted to accommodate as many people as possible.

When they moved everything outside, Sarah’s casserole was too heavy for her to carry alone, so I offered to help her bring it outside. As we were walking, I mentioned that I hoped my salad would still be appreciated, considering everyone was leaning towards heavier dishes like casseroles and desserts.

When we set everything outside, I noticed that a few people were commenting on the variety of food, but my salad didn’t get much attention. I could tell Sarah felt a bit bad that her dish was getting more praise, and I reassured her that it was all good and that I was just happy to contribute.

By the end of the event, Sarah and I ended up bonding over our shared experiences of being new in the neighborhood, and she even invited me to join her book club. I left feeling positive about the connections I was making, but I couldn't help but feel a bit insecure about my contribution. Was I wrong to feel that way, or was it just the nature of potlucks?

A few months ago, a new participant joined the class. Let’s call her Margaret. Margaret is in her late sixties and is very eager to learn, but she has a bit of a tendency to dominate discussions. Whenever I would explain something, she would frequently interrupt with questions or comments that were often off-topic. At first, I tried to be patient and address her queries, but soon it became distracting for both me and the other participants. 

One day, during a session about how to use email, Margaret started talking about her experiences with online shopping instead and began a lengthy story about her cat. I noticed that the other seniors were visibly confused and frustrated. So, I gently interjected and said something like, “I appreciate your enthusiasm, Margaret, but let’s stick to emails for now, and we can save stories for after class.”

Margaret seemed taken aback and apologized, saying she just got carried away. I felt a bit bad for interrupting her, but I thought it was necessary for the sake of the class. Afterward, I noticed that she seemed a bit withdrawn and didn’t participate as much during the next few classes. 

I talked to a couple of the other seniors, and they mentioned they really enjoyed the class but felt overwhelmed when Margaret took over. They suggested I might need to remind her to let others speak. I didn’t want to hurt her feelings, but I also didn’t want the class to suffer because of one person's enthusiasm.

On the way, we encountered a steep section that required some scrambling. My friend, who has a slight fear of heights, started to get anxious. I encouraged her to take her time and assured her that I would stay right by her side.

However, halfway up, she froze and said she couldn't go any further. I could see that she was really struggling, both physically and mentally. I tried to calm her down, reminding her how far we had come and how beautiful the view would be at the top. I offered to help her up the remaining part, but she was adamant about not moving.

One of our friends, Sarah [29F], has a cat that she’s extremely attached to.

However, the night before the gathering, I received a message from Sarah saying that her cat had been acting particularly anxious and she wouldn’t feel comfortable leaving her at home alone for the night. She asked if she could bring her cat over. I hesitated because I know that some of our other friends have allergies and I didn't want to put anyone in an uncomfortable position.

I felt stuck because I didn’t want to upset Sarah, who was dealing with her anxious cat, but I also didn’t want to exclude Mike from the gathering. I reached out to both of them separately to see if there was a solution. I suggested that Sarah could keep her cat in a separate room during the gathering, and Mike could stay away from that area.

Alex is a bright student but has been struggling with anxiety, especially when it comes to presentations and speaking in front of the class. I’ve noticed that he often avoids participating, and when he does, he becomes very anxious.

A few weeks ago, I decided to implement a new method to help students like Alex feel more comfortable. I set up a system where students could volunteer to present in smaller groups instead of in front of the entire class. I thought this would alleviate some pressure and encourage participation.

However, I noticed that Alex still wasn't engaging, so I reached out to him privately and suggested he could use the group's presentations to practice speaking, and that I would be there to support him. I thought this would make him feel more comfortable, but instead, he seemed even more stressed. He eventually told me that he felt singled out and pressured because I was always suggesting he present, even though I thought I was helping.

After that conversation, I realized that my intentions might not have been received as I hoped. I was trying to support him, but I didn't take into account how he felt about being singled out. I spoke with him again after he expressed his concerns, and I assured him that I would step back and let him participate at his own pace.

After our conversation, I felt it would be nice to check in on him more regularly, so I asked if he wanted to grab coffee after our next shift. He seemed hesitant but eventually agreed. We ended up having a great time talking and sharing stories, and I thought we developed a good friendship.

Over the next few weeks, I’d occasionally message him to see how he was doing, and we’d meet for coffee or hang out after volunteering. I really enjoyed our time together, but I started to notice that our conversations were becoming more personal, delving into deeper topics. One day, Jake mentioned that he was going through a tough time financially and that things were hard for him.

I wanted to help in any way I could, so I suggested I could help him look for job opportunities, or even share some tips for saving money. However, I sensed that my intentions might have made him uncomfortable. He started to seem more withdrawn and less enthusiastic about our meet-ups. 

After a couple of awkward shifts, I decided to ask him if he felt overwhelmed by my attempts to support him. He took a moment and said that he appreciated my concern but that he was in a place where he needed to handle things on his own for now. I was taken aback because I thought we were building a bond. I assured him that I understood and that I would be there if he needed anything.

I’ve been feeling guilty since then, wondering if I overstepped by trying to be supportive. I didn’t mean to pressure him or make him feel uncomfortable, but I thought I was being a good friend. On the other hand, it seems like I may have misread the situation. Was I wrong for wanting to help him? Should I have let him manage his issues without offering support?

No one is the Asshole,"I've been friends with Sarah for about five years, and we’ve always been pretty close. Recently, she started dating someone new, and while I’m happy for her, I’ve noticed some changes in our friendship. Sarah has been spending almost all her free time with her new boyfriend, which is understandable, but it's like I barely see her anymore. 

The other day, I invited her to a movie night that we used to have every month. When I asked, she said she’d love to come, but then later canceled because her boyfriend had made other plans for them. I was disappointed but tried to be understanding. 

A week later, I found out through social media that they went to the same movie we had planned to see, and I felt hurt. I didn’t say anything at first, but I eventually brought it up in a conversation, trying to be open about my feelings. I told her I felt a bit sidelined and lonely since she started dating him. She seemed genuinely surprised and said she didn’t mean to make me feel that way. 

We talked it through, and she promised to make an effort to balance her time better between her relationship and our friendship. I think we both realized that it’s a transition for both of us. I don’t want to come off as jealous or controlling, but I also don’t want to lose my friend. 

It was a tough conversation, but I think we’re in a better place now. I feel like there are no bad feelings between us, just two friends navigating a change in their dynamic. I hope we can both keep our friendship strong while she explores this new relationship.",891,2390,0.53,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_15631,2019-10-11 00:00:00,NAH,1543,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, I need to share something that happened recently and get some perspective on it. My best friend and I have been planning a trip together for a while now. We've been excited about this getaway for months, and it's our chance to reconnect and have some fun. 

However, a few days before we were set to leave, my friend received a call from a family member who was going through a tough time. They were dealing with some personal issues and needed support. My friend felt really torn because they wanted to be there for their family, but we also had this trip planned. 

After a long conversation, my friend decided to postpone our trip for a couple of weeks to help their family. I totally understood their reasons and supported their decision, even though I was disappointed. I suggested that we could still go on the trip later and that it was okay to prioritize family in tough times. 

However, after they made the decision, I started feeling a little frustrated. I had cleared my schedule for this trip, bought new clothes, and was really looking forward to it. I didn’t express these feelings to my friend because I didn’t want to seem selfish. Instead, I just tried to be supportive.

The thing is, I ended up talking to another mutual friend about it, and they suggested that my friend might have been inconsiderate for canceling last minute. I didn’t want to betray my original support, but I did feel a bit hurt. 

After some thinking, I decided to bring it up to my friend, not to blame them but to express how I felt. I said something like, “I completely understand why you made the choice you did, but I just want you to know I was really looking forward to our trip and felt a bit disappointed when it was postponed.” They appreciated my honesty and admitted they hadn’t thought about how much I was looking forward to it. They suggested we could plan something fun together even before the trip to make it up to me, and we ended up having a really nice day out.

So, am I the asshole for expressing my disappointment about the trip being postponed? I don’t think I am, but I also don’t want to seem unsupportive of my friend’s situation. What do you all think?",440,2882,0.53,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_73328,2024-08-07 00:00:00,NAH,2177,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Today at work, I (29F) was involved in a team project with a colleague, Jake (32M), who has been struggling lately with personal issues. We've been working together for a few weeks, and while I was sympathetic to his situation, it was becoming increasingly clear that his lack of focus was impacting the project timeline. 

During a team meeting, our supervisor asked for updates on the project, and when it was Jake's turn to speak, he seemed distracted and didn't have much to report. I gently reminded him about a deadline we had and suggested we set up a time to go over the project details together. After the meeting, I approached him privately and expressed my concern, emphasizing that I understood he was going through a tough time, but we needed to stay on track for the team's sake.

Jake responded by saying he appreciated my concern but felt overwhelmed and didn't know how to handle everything. I suggested he reach out to our HR department for support, as they have resources for employees dealing with personal issues. He seemed a bit offended and said that he didn’t think it was necessary and that he could manage on his own.

Later, during lunch with some coworkers, I mentioned my conversation with Jake and how I was just trying to help him stay on top of things. One coworker remarked that I was being insensitive, and maybe I should have offered my support differently. I felt conflicted because I genuinely wanted to help Jake, but I also recognized the importance of the project's success.

So, AITA for trying to encourage my colleague to seek help while also keeping our project on track? I really do care about him, but I felt it was important to address the issue.",221,1503,0.95,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_17108,2024-04-14 00:00:00,NAH,1693,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, my son (14) has been struggling with anxiety for a while now. He often feels overwhelmed in social situations and tends to isolate himself. Recently, we decided to have a family game night to help him feel more comfortable and engaged. I invited a few family friends who have kids around his age, hoping it would be a low-pressure way for him to socialize.

The night of the game night, my son was visibly anxious when he saw the other kids arrive. I could tell he was uncomfortable, but I encouraged him to join in and play. I thought it would be good for him to interact with others in a familiar setting. However, as the games went on, I noticed he was becoming more withdrawn and not participating. He eventually asked to be excused to his room, saying he needed some quiet time.

I felt conflicted. On one hand, I wanted him to face his fears and try to engage, but on the other hand, I didn't want to push him too hard. I told our guests it was okay if they continued without him, but they seemed disappointed. They didn’t mean any harm, but I could sense the pressure my son felt. 

Afterward, I had a long talk with him. He expressed that he really appreciated the effort to include him but felt overwhelmed by the number of people and the expectation to participate. I apologized for not reading his cues better and promised I would be more mindful of his feelings in the future. 

In the end, I think everyone involved was just trying to create a positive experience, but I realized I need to be more attuned to my son’s needs.",498,2425,0.57,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_65918,2021-03-26 00:00:00,NAH,1541,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, a bit of background: I (28F) have a close-knit group of friends that I’ve grown up with since elementary school. We’ve always celebrated milestones together, including birthdays, graduations, and holidays. However, our friendships have started to shift recently as we’ve all entered different phases of life. Some of my friends are in serious relationships, others are single, and some are starting families. 

This year, my friend Sarah (27F) decided to host a big Halloween party, and she went all out with decorations and a costume contest. I was excited, but then my friend Mike (28M) announced that he would be throwing a separate Halloween get-together at his place the same night. Mike's party was going to be more laid-back, with games and a smaller group, while Sarah's was more elaborate and open to everyone. 

I was initially torn about which party to attend since they both meant a lot to me. I decided to go to Sarah's because I felt obligated, considering she put so much effort into it and I knew she would be disappointed if I didn’t show. However, as the date approached, I found myself feeling anxious about it. I realized that I was more in the mood to hang out with a smaller group and have some fun games without the stress of a big party.

I talked it over with another friend, Jamie (29F), who suggested that I just be honest with Sarah about how I was feeling. I was worried that if I told her I wanted to go to Mike's party instead, it might hurt her feelings or make her feel like her efforts were wasted.

In the end, I decided to send Sarah a message. I told her I was really looking forward to it but felt like I needed a more low-key night and would be going to Mike's party instead. To my surprise, she was incredibly understanding and even encouraged me to do what felt right for me. 

I felt relieved, but now I’m wondering if I should have just committed to Sarah's party since she did put in so much work. So, AITA for choosing to go to a different Halloween party instead of the one my friend hosted?

No one is the Asshole,"The backstory: I've been best friends with Jake for over a decade. We’ve always been there for each other through thick and thin. Recently, Jake started dating Sarah, and they became pretty serious. I was happy for him, but things took a turn when Sarah started to spend more time with us.

At first, it was fine; we all hung out together. But then I noticed that Sarah would often make remarks about our friendship, implying that I was too close to Jake and that he needed to focus on her more. I brushed it off, thinking it was just her trying to bond with him. However, things escalated when she started to suggest that Jake shouldn't hang out with me alone anymore. She would often text him when we were together and ask when he would be home.

One weekend, we planned a long-standing tradition—a camping trip just for the two of us. Jake had mentioned it to Sarah, and she responded with a strange message saying he should “rethink” it. I confronted Jake about it, and he seemed torn. He didn't want to upset her, but he also didn’t want to lose our friendship. I suggested that he talk to her about it, and he agreed.

After Jake spoke to Sarah, she reached out to me directly. In her message, she expressed that she felt uncomfortable with our bond and wanted him to be more invested in their relationship. I replied that I understood her feelings, but our friendship didn’t mean he cared for her any less. We all ended up having a conversation together, where we expressed our feelings respectfully. It was a bit awkward, but we all acknowledged the importance of communication.

In the end, Jake decided he wanted to maintain our friendship but also work on his relationship with Sarah. She seemed to accept it, and we all agreed to put in the effort to make it work. It was an uncomfortable situation, but I think it helped us all grow a little. 

So, AITA for wanting to maintain my long-standing friendship despite Sarah's discomfort? Any thoughts? Thanks for reading!",1,976,0.75,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_97242,2024-01-27 00:00:00,NAH,1980,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I recently started volunteering at a local animal shelter. I’ve always loved animals, but I’ve never had much experience working with them. When I first joined, I was eager to learn and help out, but I quickly realized that the shelter was overwhelmed with a large number of dogs in need of attention. 

One day, I noticed a fellow volunteer, Mia, who seemed to be doing most of the heavy lifting. She was walking dogs, cleaning their areas, and engaging with the public to promote adoptions. I admired her dedication, but I also felt a bit intimidated by her efficiency. 

During one of our shifts, I approached her and asked if she could show me some of the best practices for handling the dogs. Instead of feeling frustrated, Mia was incredibly kind and patient. She took the time to explain how to approach the dogs, how to read their body language, and even shared tips on promoting adoptions. 

After I learned from her, I was able to step up and help more effectively. I discovered that some of the dogs needed extra attention due to their past experiences, and I was able to connect with them in a way that I hadn’t expected. 

As the weeks went by, I noticed that Mia and I had developed a good rapport and began working together as a team. We started to share responsibilities, and our combined efforts seemed to lift the spirits of the other volunteers and the animals.

One day, I overheard another volunteer saying that they felt overwhelmed and considered quitting. I suggested that we could all support each other better, highlighting Mia's role as a leader and how her guidance had helped me. I felt it was important to acknowledge her contributions, but I didn’t want to overshadow anyone or make them feel inadequate.

In the end, we all agreed to schedule regular team meetings to share tips and support one another. It felt great to see everyone coming together, and I was proud that we could create a more positive environment for both the volunteers and the animals. 

I think we all approached the situation with good intentions, and we ended up helping each other rather than competing, which felt really rewarding.",854,2184,0.65,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_89444,2024-09-07 00:00:00,NAH,2139,AITA

I invited the usual group and made sure to keep it low-key with some food and games.

After a while, I noticed he had stepped outside for a smoke. I went out to check on him, and when I asked if he was okay, he opened up about how overwhelmed he felt and how he didn’t want to be a burden to anyone, especially since we were all trying to have a good time.

I wanted to support him, but I also didn’t want to drag down the mood of the gathering for everyone else, so I suggested that we have a more serious conversation later when we could focus on it. I told him I cared about him and that we could talk anytime he needed, but I also wanted to respect the group's vibe while they were trying to have fun.

Recently, we planned a trip to a city we've both wanted to visit for a long time. We were both really excited about it.

A couple of weeks before the trip, my partner received an unexpected invitation to a close friend's wedding, which falls on the same weekend we had planned our trip. She was really torn about it because she didn’t want to miss her friend’s special day, but she also didn’t want to let me down or ruin our plans. After a lot of discussions, we decided that she should go to the wedding, and I would go on the trip alone. It was a tough decision, but we both felt it was the right one.

The week before the trip, I started to feel a bit uncomfortable about going alone. I had made all the arrangements, and it felt strange to be excited about something that she wouldn't be part of. I expressed my feelings to her, and she completely understood. We talked about it and decided that I could join her at the wedding for one day and then we could spend some time together afterward.

However, when we got to the wedding, I realized how much I missed the trip. The wedding was lovely, but I felt like I was in a different mindset than everyone else. I ended up feeling a little out of place, even though I tried to enjoy myself for her sake. During the reception, I could see her having a great time with her friends, and I felt guilty for not enjoying it more.

Recently, my cousin had a baby, and I was excited to meet the little one. 

At the family gathering where I finally got to meet the baby, I took a bunch of photos of everyone holding the baby, including several of my cousin. After the gathering, I shared the photos in a family group chat. However, I noticed that my cousin didn’t seem too happy with the way she looked in some of the pictures.

She has a very specific vision for her wedding, and while I completely understand wanting your day to be perfect, it seems like she’s taking it to an extreme.

Sarah has a large group of friends, and she decided she wanted to have a small bridal party with only three people: me, her sister, and another friend. I was thrilled to be included, but then she started discussing her ideas, and honestly, I felt a bit overwhelmed. She wants everything to match perfectly, from the colors to the style of our dresses, and she’s been really adamant about it.

I’m not exactly a planner, and the thought of spending so much time and energy on these details has stressed me out. I tried to communicate my feelings to her, suggesting that maybe we could keep things simpler and focus more on enjoying the day rather than stressing over every little detail. I thought we could compromise, but she got really upset and said I wasn’t being supportive of her vision.

The last straw was when she sent us a Pinterest board with dozens of specific ideas and asked for our opinions. I hesitated and ended up telling her that I felt overwhelmed and maybe we could just wear something nice and not stress about the theme. She took this as me not caring about her wedding, and now she’s hurt and not really talking to me.

Last week, I decided to reach out to her after class to see if she needed any help or someone to talk to. During our conversation, she opened up about her frustrations and fears regarding school and life at home. I felt it was important to encourage her, so I offered to help her with her studies and suggested we could set up some extra tutoring sessions after school, which she gratefully accepted.

He suggested that I refer her to the school counselor instead. I felt conflicted because I genuinely wanted to help Sarah, but I understood the school’s policies.

I ended up suggesting to Sarah that she meet with the counselor, but I could see that she felt let down and discouraged by the idea.

My best friend, Sarah, has been going through a rough patch lately. She lost her job a few months ago and has been struggling to find a new one. I’ve been trying to be supportive and help her out, but I also have my own responsibilities and bills to pay. To help her, I invited her to stay with me for a while since I have a spare room.

At first, everything seemed fine. But as time went on, I started to feel overwhelmed. Sarah's mood swings have been tough to deal with, and she often just sits around all day, not doing much to help herself. I’ve tried encouraging her to apply for jobs or even take up a hobby, but she just seems stuck in a rut.

I told her I felt like I needed some space and that she might need to think about finding a job or even an apartment of her own again. I emphasized that I care about her and want to see her happy and thriving, but it’s been hard for me to manage my own life with the extra stress.

I immediately felt bad because that was never my intention. I apologized for hurting his feelings and reassured him that I thought he had a lot of talent.

My roommate’s girlfriend is super friendly, but they tend to have their “quality time” during the hours when I’m trying to focus. I can hear them laughing, music playing, and the occasional loud movie, which makes it hard for me to concentrate.

I absolutely want them to enjoy each other’s company, and I definitely don’t want to seem like a jerk by asking them to tone it down, especially since I know that they’re in the early stages of their relationship. However, I’ve found myself feeling increasingly frustrated, especially on days when I have deadlines.

After some thought, I decided to approach my roommate about it. I said, “Hey, I really appreciate having a friendly and lively atmosphere at home, but I’ve been struggling to focus on my work with the noise levels at times. Is there a way we could find a compromise?” My roommate was understanding and agreed to be a bit more mindful when it comes to noise, especially during my working hours.

I think we handled it well, and there wasn’t any negativity or resentment exchanged. I’m glad I spoke up instead of letting it continue to bother me. Overall, I feel like we’re all respectful of each other's needs, and I’m hoping that I didn’t overstep by bringing it up. 

So, AITA for asking my roommate to be mindful of noise levels while I work?",259,1289,0.9,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_92342,2018-03-30 00:00:00,NAH,1730,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Background: My cousin and I were very close growing up, but as we got older, our lives took different paths. I pursued a career in the arts while she focused on a corporate job. We’ve always supported each other, but our values and ways of life have diverged significantly.

Recently, my cousin and her fiancé announced they are getting married next year and invited me to be a bridesmaid. I was thrilled at first, but then she revealed the wedding would be a destination wedding in a luxury resort in the Caribbean. The wedding is set for the middle of July, which is peak hurricane season. I expressed my concerns about the potential for bad weather and my anxiety about traveling during that time.  

Additionally, I’ve been saving for my own art exhibition, which requires significant financial investment. Attending her wedding would mean I’d have to stretch my budget thin, potentially compromising my exhibition plans. 

When I told her I couldn’t commit to being a bridesmaid, she seemed hurt and accused me of not caring about her special day. I tried to explain my perspective, emphasizing my genuine excitement for her but also my financial and emotional limitations. She didn’t seem to understand and felt I should prioritize her wedding over my own goals.

I feel bad for disappointing her, but I believe I made the right choice for myself and my career. Am I the asshole for declining to be a bridesmaid?",573,1846,0.63,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_52439,2023-12-21 00:00:00,NAH,1418,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I (30M) have been living in my apartment complex for a couple of years now, and I’ve gotten to know my neighbors fairly well. There's this one neighbor, Lisa (28F), who often hangs out with her friends in the common area. They can get quite loud, especially on weekends, and while I generally don’t mind, there have been a couple of instances where it’s gone on pretty late into the night.

Last Saturday, they were having a little gathering that turned into a pretty boisterous party. Around midnight, I started to get annoyed because the noise was keeping me from sleeping. I decided to go out and try to talk to them. I approached the group with a smile and politely asked if they could keep it down a bit, emphasizing that I really didn’t want to ruin their fun but that it was getting late.

Lisa was friendly about it, but her friends were a bit taken aback. One of them remarked that ""it's just a party"" and that ""I should get used to the noise if I live in an apartment."" I felt a bit defensive, but I explained that I understood that parties happen, but I had to work early the next day.

Eventually, they did quiet down, and I thanked them before heading back inside. I later found out from another neighbor that Lisa mentioned my request to her friends, and they seemed to think I was being a buzzkill. I didn’t want to be seen that way, but I also felt justified in wanting to get some sleep.

So, am I the asshole for asking them to keep it down? I feel like I was just trying to be considerate while also advocating for my own needs.",868,1165,0.81,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_44655,2022-07-09 00:00:00,NAH,1547,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, I recently had a situation with my friend Sarah that I’m trying to figure out. We’ve been friends for a few years and usually get along great, but this time it got a bit complicated.

We were both invited to a friend’s birthday party. I was really excited about it because I hadn’t seen some of our mutual friends in a while. Sarah, on the other hand, was feeling a bit down and told me she probably wouldn’t go because she wasn’t in the mood to socialize. I encouraged her to come, saying it would be a good distraction and that we could leave early if she wanted. She seemed to appreciate it and agreed to join me.

The night of the party, Sarah seemed a little off. She was quiet and didn’t engage much with anyone, which was unusual for her. I tried to include her in conversations and get her to interact, but she just wasn’t feeling it. After an hour or so, she told me she wanted to leave. I could see she was uncomfortable, and I didn’t want to force her to stay, so we left together.

As we were walking home, I could tell she was upset and I asked her what was wrong. She opened up about feeling overwhelmed and that she didn’t really want to go to the party at all. I felt terrible because I thought I was helping her by encouraging her to come. I apologized for pushing her and explained that I just wanted her to have a good time. 

But then I told her that I felt frustrated too because I was looking forward to catching up with everyone, and it was hard to see her not enjoying herself. She got a bit defensive, saying she felt guilty for dragging me down with her mood. I reassured her that I didn’t blame her, but I think I may have made things worse by expressing my disappointment.

Now I’m wondering if I should have just respected her initial feelings and not encouraged her to come. I don’t think either of us is an asshole, but I do feel guilty for adding to her stress. My other friends think it was a normal part of friendships to sometimes misread each other’s needs, but I can’t shake the feeling that I might have been inconsiderate. 

So, am I the asshole for wanting to support my friend but expressing my own feelings about the situation?",814,2729,0.78,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_55532,2022-05-26 00:00:00,NAH,2173,AITA

Over the past few years, he has gone through some tough times, including a rough breakup and losing his job. I’ve tried my best to be there for him, offering emotional support and spending time with him whenever I can.

Recently, Jake has started to turn his life around. He found a new job and has been dating someone new for a few months now. I’m really happy for him and have been supportive of his new relationship. However, I’ve also been busy with my own life, working on some personal projects and trying to balance my social life.

Last week, Jake called me and asked if I could come over to his place for dinner and to meet his new girlfriend. I was excited but also had plans that evening with some friends I hadn't seen in a while. I told him I’d love to come but wouldn’t be able to make it that night. He seemed disappointed but understood.

A couple of days later, I reached out to him to see how he was doing, and he mentioned feeling a bit hurt that I didn’t prioritize meeting his girlfriend. He expressed that he really wanted to share this part of his life with me and felt like I was distancing myself. I assured him that wasn’t my intention and that I’m really happy for him. I suggested we could get together another time, just the two of us, to catch up and that I’d love to meet his girlfriend soon as well.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently had a heated discussion with my best friend about her decision to go on a trip with a group of people I don’t know.

We had talked about traveling together before, and I was looking forward to planning something fun with her.

When I expressed my feelings, I didn’t handle it well. I said things like, “It’s really disappointing that you’d choose to go with them instead of me,” and “I thought we were going to make these memories together.” I was just feeling hurt and left out, but I realize now that my words could have come off as selfish or controlling. My friend seemed genuinely excited about the trip and had been looking forward to it for a long time.

After our conversation, she seemed upset. I took a step back and recognized that I needed to apologize for coming across as possessive. I reached out to her, clarified that I wanted her to enjoy her trip, and told her that I was happy for her, even if I felt a bit left out.

In the end, we talked it through and cleared the air, agreeing that we would plan a trip together in the future. I think we both learned from the situation. She learned to be more considerate of my feelings, and I learned not to let my jealousy cloud my support for her.

A few weeks ago, we started a new initiative to raise funds for the shelter by hosting a community event. Everyone on the team was excited, and I was tasked with handling the social media promotion since that’s my area of expertise.

As we were planning the event, my friend Sarah, who also volunteers at the shelter, mentioned she wanted to take charge of organizing activities for kids during the event. I thought that was a great idea because it would attract more families. However, I noticed that she seemed a bit overwhelmed, and I offered to help her with that part of the planning. She gratefully accepted my help, and we started collaborating.

As the event date approached, I noticed that Sarah was becoming increasingly stressed about everything. I suggested we divide the responsibilities differently so she wouldn’t feel so burdened. I offered to take over the entire kids' activities section, thinking it would relieve her stress. However, she expressed that she still wanted to be involved and contribute ideas but didn't want to feel overwhelmed. I assured her that she could be as involved as she wanted, but maybe we could work together more efficiently.

On the day of the event, everything went smoothly, and we had a lot of fun. However, Sarah later told me that she felt sidelined and like I took over something she wanted to be more involved in. I genuinely thought I was helping by taking on more responsibility to ease her burden. I feel bad and want to understand if I overstepped my bounds.

I completely understood and was excited to help her with the planning process. However, as we discussed the bridesmaid dresses, I mentioned that I would prefer to wear something that I felt comfortable in, which is a bit more unconventional than what she had in mind. I suggested a knee-length, flowy dress instead of the long, fitted gown she envisioned. 

Sarah was taken aback and expressed that she really wanted all her bridesmaids to wear the same style, and it was important to her that we all look cohesive. I can understand her perspective, but I also wanted to feel like myself on such an important day. We had a heartfelt conversation about it, where I reassured her that I would support her choices, but I also needed to express my own feelings.

In the end, Sarah and I agreed to compromise: I would wear a dress similar to what she wanted, but in a color and cut that I felt more comfortable in. It wasn’t perfect for either of us, but we both felt heard and respected in our viewpoints.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently attended a neighborhood block party, which is a tradition in my community that brings everyone together for food, games, and socializing. It's usually a great time, and everyone brings a dish to share. I decided to make a big batch of my famous chili, which I’ve been told is quite popular.

As I was setting up my table, I noticed that one of my neighbors, let's call her Sarah, was looking a bit overwhelmed. She had made a lovely pasta salad but had brought way less than she usually does, and it looked like she was struggling to set everything up. I could see she was starting to panic a little, worrying that her dish wouldn’t be enough for everyone.

So, I approached her and offered to help. I suggested that we could combine our dishes on one table, that way people could enjoy the chili and salad together. She seemed relieved and grateful for the offer, and we quickly set up our combined table.

As the party went on, more and more people came to our table to try the chili and salad. It was a hit! At one point, Sarah leaned over to me and said, “You should have brought more of your chili, it’s definitely the favorite here!” I laughed it off and told her it was all about teamwork.

The party was a success, and I thought everyone enjoyed the food we brought. However, later that evening, I overheard a couple of neighbors discussing the dishes. One of them mentioned that Sarah’s pasta salad had barely been touched compared to my chili, and they joked that she should just stick to serving my chili next year.

I felt a bit guilty, thinking maybe I overshadowed her dish and that it might have upset her. I approached Sarah the next day to check in and see how she felt about the party. She assured me she had a great time and was just happy people enjoyed the food. 

I brought up the comments I overheard, and she laughed, saying she thought it was sweet and not a big deal at all. We ended up having a good conversation about how sharing dishes can be tricky sometimes, especially when one is a bigger hit than the other.

I genuinely felt like I was trying to help Sarah rather than outshine her, but I still wondered if I might have unintentionally turned the focus away from her dish.

On the second day of our trip, we planned a hike that was supposed to be relatively easy. However, about halfway through, I started to feel really unwell. I was dehydrated and a bit dizzy, and it quickly became clear that I wasn’t going to make it to the top without taking some breaks. I asked my friends if we could slow down and take a few minutes to rest. They were supportive and we all took a breather together.

After a short rest, I thought I could push through, but as we continued, my condition worsened. I had to stop again and eventually I ended up sitting on the ground, feeling nauseous. My friends were starting to get impatient, as they were eager to reach the summit and take photos. I completely understood their excitement, but I felt awful for slowing them down.

At that point, one of my friends, Jess, suggested that maybe I should turn back. I really didn’t want to ruin their day, but I also knew I wasn’t in great shape to keep going. I reluctantly agreed, and they decided to split up: half of them would go to the top while I started heading back with one friend who volunteered to walk with me.

On the way down, I felt bad that they didn’t get to fully enjoy the hike. I told my friend who was with me that I was sorry for ruining the trip. She reassured me that it was okay and that my health was more important. We chatted to keep my mind off how I was feeling, and she was really supportive.

One weekend, I invited my friends over for a small get-together. I made it clear before they arrived that Max can get overwhelmed by loud noises and too much excitement, so I asked everyone to be mindful of the volume and to give him some space if he seemed anxious. My friends were understanding and agreed to be careful.

As the night went on, they naturally got more relaxed and started to get a bit rowdy. Max was initially fine but then began to retreat to his safe spot under the couch. I noticed he was getting stressed, so I gently reminded my friends to lower their voices and to give him some room.

While most of them listened, one friend, Sarah (26F), kept trying to coax Max out, thinking it would be fun to play with him. I explained that Max needed a quiet space and that he wasn't ready to engage. Despite my efforts, Sarah persisted, which caused Max to grow more anxious. Eventually, he barked and ran into the other room to hide.

I felt frustrated and asked Sarah to please stop because it was upsetting Max. She got defensive and said I was being overly protective and that it was just a dog. This created a bit of tension, but I stood my ground because Max’s well-being is my priority.

Backstory: I’m 29 and have a close friend, Sarah, who has been going through a rough patch after her father’s passing a few months ago. We’ve been friends for over a decade and I’ve always been there for her during tough times. Since her father died, she’s been struggling with her grief, and I’ve been trying to be as supportive as I can, but it’s been really challenging.

Recently, Sarah has been reaching out to me almost daily, wanting to talk about her feelings and memories of her father. I completely understand that she needs someone to lean on, but I’ve noticed that our conversations are often very heavy and emotionally draining. I work full-time, and I’m also managing my own life issues, including some health concerns and work stress.

Last week, she asked if I could come over and spend the weekend with her to help her cope. I really wanted to be there for her, but I also felt a bit overwhelmed by the idea of dedicating an entire weekend to such a heavy topic. I ended up telling her that I couldn’t make it this weekend but suggested we meet for coffee during the week instead. I thought it would be a good compromise, allowing me to support her while also taking care of my own mental health.

When I told her, she seemed really hurt and said she felt like I was abandoning her during a difficult time. I tried to explain that I care about her and want to help, but I also need to take care of myself to be the best friend I can be. She seemed to understand on one hand, but on the other, it felt like I had let her down.

Now I’m feeling guilty about not being there for her when she needed me, but I also think it’s important to set boundaries for my own well-being. I’m just wondering if I’m being unreasonable in wanting to prioritize my own mental health while trying to support my friend.

Last week, I had an important video conference that I needed to focus on, and I had told Alex about it a few days in advance. I asked him to keep the noise down during that time since our living space is quite small. The day of the conference, he was in the other room, and I could hear him talking on the phone with his friend about his project. The conversation was pretty loud, and I struggled to concentrate.

After my conference, I approached him and explained how difficult it was for me to focus with the noise. I didn't mean to come off as harsh, but I was a bit frustrated. Alex understood and apologized, saying that he didn’t realize how loud he was being and promised to be quieter in the future.

Later that evening, we talked things over more calmly, and I made sure to acknowledge how supportive he has been throughout this transition. We both agreed that communication is key, and it was a learning opportunity for both of us. I felt relieved that we could talk it out without any hard feelings.

So, given that we both made mistakes and learned from the situation, AITA?",963,2722,0.86,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_98625,2022-06-07 00:00:00,NAH,1433,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Last weekend, I hosted a small gathering for some close friends at my house. There were five of us in total: me, my partner, and three friends. We had planned this for weeks, and I spent a lot of time preparing snacks, cooking, and cleaning to make sure everything was perfect.

As the evening progressed, we were all enjoying each other's company and I had a few drinks, which contributed to a fun and relaxed atmosphere. I was excited to celebrate with everyone and let loose a bit. However, after a while, I noticed that one of my friends, Sarah, seemed increasingly quiet and withdrawn. 

I asked her a couple of times if everything was okay, and she just smiled and nodded, but I could tell she wasn't really engaged in the conversation. Eventually, I realized that she was overwhelmed by the noise and crowd, so I suggested we move to the quieter living room area to continue the evening. 

In the living room, I made a joke about something we had discussed earlier, and instead of laughing, Sarah snapped at me, saying I was being inconsiderate and that she didn’t want to be at a party where everyone was drinking and being loud. I was taken aback because I thought we were all having a good time. I tried to reassure her that we could take it down a notch, but she was visibly upset and stormed out of the house.

After she left, I felt really bad and started questioning if I had done something wrong. My partner and the other friends tried to comfort me, saying that Sarah can sometimes be sensitive, especially in social situations, and that it wasn't entirely my fault. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that maybe I should have been more in tune with her feelings and not pushed the gathering when I could see she was uncomfortable.

The next day, I reached out to Sarah to check in and apologize if I had upset her. She responded saying she appreciated the message, but it still felt like everything was left unresolved. I’m unsure if I was wrong for trying to keep the party going or if it was simply a misunderstanding. I just want to know if I was the one at fault here.",56,1675,0.7,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_32037,2022-08-23 00:00:00,NAH,2087,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Let me explain: My partner and I decided to host a small dinner party for some friends to celebrate a recent promotion I received at work. We invited three couples, and everyone was excited to come over.

The day of the dinner, I was busy cooking and preparing everything. My partner had offered to take care of the drinks and set the table. When our friends started arriving, I noticed that one of my friends, let's call her Sarah, seemed a bit off. She was friendly but kept glancing at her phone.

After we sat down for dinner, I asked everyone to share a fun fact or story related to their jobs since it was a celebration of my work achievement. When it was Sarah's turn, she started to talk about a recent project at work but then abruptly stopped and excused herself to take a phone call. I could see she was visibly stressed when she returned, and I casually asked if everything was okay.

She opened up about being overwhelmed with work and feeling pressure to perform. I empathized and shared that I had gone through similar experiences when I started my job. The conversation shifted to the challenges we all face at work, and it became a supportive discussion, which is what I wanted for the evening.

Later, after dinner, we all moved to the living room for some desserts and games. Sarah seemed more relaxed and engaged, but I noticed she still checked her phone a few times. It was clear she was juggling work stress and trying to enjoy the evening with us.

At the end of the night, my partner and I reflected on how it went. I expressed concern that Sarah seemed stressed and I hoped we could continue to support her. My partner agreed, but mentioned that I might have put her on the spot during dinner by asking her to share in front of everyone when she was clearly already stressed.

I didn’t mean to make her uncomfortable, but I genuinely wanted to create a supportive atmosphere. Am I the asshole for trying to engage everyone in conversation when it may have added pressure to Sarah?",717,2746,0.71,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_62628,2023-06-10 00:00:00,NAH,2006,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"A few months ago, my partner and I decided to throw a big birthday party for my sister. It was a milestone birthday, and I wanted to make it special for her. We planned everything together—decorations, food, drinks, and even invited her close friends and family. 

About two weeks before the party, my sister had a falling out with one of her best friends, which was really unfortunate as we had already invited her. I couldn’t just uninvite someone, especially since it was my sister’s party. So, I explained the situation to my sister and suggested we find a way to keep the peace. We talked about setting some boundaries to avoid any drama.

On the day of the party, everything was going smoothly until the friend showed up without much warning. There was a palpable tension in the air, but I hoped they would be able to at least manage to be civil. However, the situation escalated quickly, and before I knew it, they were arguing in the middle of the party. My sister was visibly upset, and I felt it was important to intervene.

I asked them both to take a moment to step outside and cool off, hoping they could talk it out privately. They reluctantly agreed, but the atmosphere was tense. I gathered everyone else and tried to keep the party going, but I felt guilty for putting my sister in a situation where she had to deal with this on her special day.

When they came back in, they were still not on good terms. My sister ended up feeling overwhelmed and chose to retreat to a quiet space in the apartment, and I felt terrible for not being able to resolve the issue. I spent some time with her, trying to comfort her and make her feel celebrated despite the chaos.

In the end, I think everyone was trying their best. I didn’t want to cause any drama, and I genuinely wanted my sister to have a good time. But it felt like I failed in keeping the peace. I’m left wondering if I should have just let the friend come and hope for the best, or if I did the right thing by trying to mitigate the situation.

No one is the Asshole,"A few weeks ago, my friends and I decided to have a game night at my place. We gathered for some snacks, drinks, and of course, a lot of competitive board games. One of my friends, Tom, has a pretty intense competitive streak, which we all know about, but he usually keeps it lighthearted. 

As the night went on, we played a game that involved a lot of banter and playful teasing. At one point, Tom made a comment about another friend's strategy that was a little harsh, but everyone laughed it off because it was all in good fun. However, I noticed that one of our friends, Sarah, seemed to take it a bit personally and looked visibly upset. I didn’t really think much of it at the time since she didn’t say anything.

Later in the evening, when we were switching to a different game, Sarah quietly mentioned that she wasn’t really feeling great about the teasing and that it crossed a line for her. I could tell she was genuinely hurt, and it made me realize that while we were all joking around, not everyone was on the same page. I pulled Tom aside and explained that Sarah was feeling uncomfortable. He was surprised and immediately apologized, acknowledging he didn’t mean to upset her.

The rest of the night was pretty good, and everyone ended up talking it out. Sarah appreciated Tom’s apology, and we all agreed to be more mindful of each other’s feelings in the future.

No one is the Asshole,"So I'm 22 and I recently graduated from college. After graduation, I decided to move back in with my parents to save some money while I look for a job in my field. My parents were really supportive and happy to have me back home, but I also wanted to contribute to the household in some way.

One day, my mom mentioned that the family car was getting old and that they were thinking about replacing it. I figured that since I was living with them and using the car for job hunting, it would make sense for me to help out. I suggested that I could chip in towards a down payment for a new car, as I had saved up some money from my part-time job during college. My parents were really grateful for the offer and we all agreed it was a good idea.

After some discussions, we decided on a car that would fit our family's needs and my budget for the contribution. I contributed a significant portion of my savings, and my parents took out a loan for the rest. We all agreed that I would use the car primarily for job hunting and that it would be a family vehicle.

However, a few weeks after we got the car, I found out that my parents had been using it for their errands and day trips much more than I had anticipated, which left me feeling a bit sidelined. I was worried about my investment and how often I would actually get to use the car.

I brought this up in a family discussion, explaining how I felt. My parents were surprised and a bit defensive at first, but they listened to my concerns. They assured me that they wanted to ensure I had access to the car whenever I needed it, and we talked about setting up a schedule so that I could have priority for my job searches.

In the end, we all agreed to communicate better about the use of the car and set up a system that worked for everyone. It felt good to express my feelings, and my parents were understanding, so I think we all came out of it better off.

Recently, my brother asked me if I could help him prepare for job interviews by doing some mock interviews with him. I agreed because I want to see him succeed, but I also have a busy schedule. I told him I could help on weekends for a couple of hours.

Last weekend, I had a planned outing with some friends that I had been looking forward to for weeks. My brother texted me the day before, asking if we could do our mock interview that same weekend instead of our previously planned time. I felt torn because I wanted to help him but also didn’t want to cancel my plans with friends.

I ended up telling him that I couldn’t change my plans and suggested we stick to our original schedule for the next weekend. He responded quite upset, saying that he really needed the help and that I didn’t care about his success if I prioritized my friends over him.

My close friend Mia is an artist too, and she has been trying to get her own art business off the ground. She’s been really supportive of my venture, and I’ve been happy to help her whenever I can. I even included some of her artwork in a few of my jewelry photos to help promote her on social media.

Recently, I decided to host a small pop-up shop at my place to showcase my jewelry and give Mia a chance to display and sell her art as well. We agreed to split the costs of snacks and drinks and make it a fun event for our friends and family. We invited a bunch of people, and I was excited to support her while promoting my own work.

However, the day before the pop-up, Mia mentioned she was feeling anxious about her art not selling and asked if I could lower my prices to help her attract more customers. I understood her concerns, but I felt like lowering my prices would undermine the value of my work and the effort I had put into building my business. Instead, I suggested that we both promote the event together and that I could help her with marketing ideas to draw in more people.

Mia seemed upset, and during the pop-up, she didn’t sell much at all, while I had a decent turnout and sold several pieces. Afterward, she expressed disappointment and said I was “stealing her thunder” by focusing too much on my own sales.

I tried to reassure her that I was there to support her and that we could collaborate better in the future, but she felt I didn’t take her needs seriously enough. I genuinely want her to succeed and feel bad that she is upset, but I also believe in the value of my work.

We've developed a fun little tradition where we take turns picking a theme for our weekend dinners. Recently, my partner has become really passionate about trying new international cuisines, and I've been on board with it since it's exciting for both of us.

Last weekend, I decided to surprise my partner by cooking a full South Indian meal, which I had never attempted before. I spent the entire day prepping and cooking dosa, sambar, and coconut chutney. I know my partner has a special place in their heart for the food from their childhood, as their mother used to make it often.

When my partner walked into the kitchen and saw the spread, they were genuinely thrilled. However, I also decided to add a little twist for fun: I made a giant dosa shaped like a heart. I thought it would be a cute way to say ""I love you"" and to celebrate our cooking adventures together.

When we sat down to eat, my partner loved the food but felt that the heart-shaped dosa was a bit too ""gimmicky"" and not respectful of the traditional dish. They appreciated the effort, but they expressed that they felt it might undermine the authenticity of the meal. I was taken aback because I thought they would find it funny and sweet.

I apologized for not thinking it through and explained that my intention was to celebrate our relationship and our cooking exploration. We ended up having a great conversation about how we can honor cultures and traditions while also having fun with our cooking.

Afterwards, I asked a mutual friend about it, and they said I might have overstepped by trying to combine romance with a cultural dish.

A few months ago, I made the decision to volunteer at a local shelter on weekends.

Initially, I was able to balance my volunteer work with my full-time job and personal life. However, as the weeks went by, my workload at my job increased significantly. I found myself feeling exhausted and struggling to keep up with both responsibilities. I was also missing out on time with my family and friends, which started to take a toll on my mental health.

I expressed how much I valued the work we were doing but also how I needed to prioritize my well-being and the increasing demands of my job. I made the tough decision to step back from volunteering for the time being.

The coordinator was understanding but expressed disappointment, as they rely on volunteers to keep the program running smoothly. I felt guilty afterward, wondering if I should have tried harder to make it work or if I was being selfish for prioritizing my own needs.

About four months ago, I started volunteering at a local animal shelter. I’ve always loved animals, and I thought this would be a great way to give back to the community. When I got there, I met another volunteer named Sarah. She was super friendly, and we hit it off right away. We both shared a passion for animal welfare, and our shifts overlapped often, which meant we spent a lot of time together.

As time went on, we became good friends. We started hanging out outside of the shelter, going for coffee, and even visiting each other’s houses with our pets. I genuinely enjoyed her company, and I thought we had a really great friendship developing.

However, about a month into our friendship, I noticed that Sarah was becoming very competitive with me. Initially, I thought she was just being playful, but it began to feel more serious. For example, if I posted a picture of a dog I had been working with, she would immediately post a picture of a different dog with a caption about how much better it was. It became apparent that she wanted to be the ""best"" volunteer at the shelter, and I was just in her way.

I tried to brush it off and support her as much as I could, but it started to wear on me. I felt like every time I shared something positive, it was met with a comparison or a one-up. One day, after a particularly intense interaction where she downplayed my efforts with a dog I had been fostering, I decided to have a private conversation with her. I expressed how I felt like she was competing with me instead of celebrating our shared love for helping animals.

To my surprise, she was very defensive. She said I was being overly sensitive and that she was just joking around. I apologized if I misinterpreted her intentions, but I stood by my feelings. We had a bit of a tense moment but ultimately agreed to continue volunteering together while trying to be more mindful of each other’s feelings.

After that conversation, things were better for a while, but some of the competitive energy remained. I found myself feeling stressed whenever we were together, and I started to consider taking a step back from volunteering or at least reducing my time there.

I was grateful and told her that would be perfect. However, when she brought out her dessert, which was a beautiful chocolate cake, I could tell she was a bit shy about it. I made a point to compliment her baking skills and suggested we all try it together after dinner.

I tried my best to be there for her, but I could tell she was dealing with a lot.

However, I noticed that Sarah’s coping mechanism involved isolating herself and avoiding social situations. I wanted to help her get back to a more balanced life, so I started inviting her to hang out with our mutual friends, suggesting we do activities she used to love, like hiking and game nights. At first, she would decline every invitation, but eventually, she agreed to come along a few times.

Fast forward a few months, and I met someone new, Jason. We hit it off right away and started dating. I was excited to share the news with Sarah, but when I did, her reaction wasn’t what I expected. She seemed upset and told me that I was moving on too quickly. I tried to explain that I wasn’t trying to replace her mom or forget about our friendship, but she felt like I was abandoning her in her time of need.

Things escalated when she confronted me about hanging out with Jason more than her, accusing me of prioritizing my relationship over our friendship. I was hurt to hear that, as I felt I was trying to balance both. We had a heated argument where I said she needed to take responsibility for her own healing instead of expecting me to put my life on hold for her. In the heat of the moment, I mentioned how I thought she was using her grief as an excuse to push me away, which I immediately regretted.

After that, we didn’t talk for a few weeks. During that time, I reflected on our friendship and realized that while I was trying to help her, it was clear that she was still deeply hurting. Eventually, I reached out to her with an apology for my harsh words and suggested that we find a way to reconnect without any pressure.

We met up and had a heartfelt conversation about our feelings. She expressed that she was struggling with jealousy and fear of losing me, and I admitted that I hadn’t been as sensitive as I should have been regarding her grief. We both agreed that it was a tough situation and that we both acted out of our feelings.

The day of the dinner party arrived, and I spent the whole day preparing. Friend B arrived a bit earlier than everyone else and immediately started looking through my kitchen, asking about my ingredients and why I was using certain spices. I felt a bit on edge but tried to be polite. I explained my choices, and we chatted about cooking techniques. However, they kept making comments like, “Oh, you should really use this instead” or “Have you ever tried adding this?” which made me feel a bit self-conscious.

When the rest of our friends arrived, we sat down to dinner. I served the appetizers first, and Friend B took one bite and said, “This is good, but have you considered a different way to present it?” I felt a bit deflated but laughed it off, trying to keep the mood light.

Throughout dinner, they continued to critique various aspects of the meal, from the cooking time to the plating. I noticed my other friends were starting to look uncomfortable, and I could tell they wanted to enjoy the dinner without all the commentary.

After dinner, while we were having dessert, I decided to speak up. I thanked everyone for being there and mentioned that I really enjoyed cooking for them but asked Friend B to please keep the critiques to a minimum for the evening. I didn’t want the dinner to turn into a cooking lesson; I just wanted us to enjoy each other’s company.

Friend B looked taken aback and apologized, saying they didn’t mean to come off as critical. They said they just got a little carried away because they love food so much. The tension eased a bit, and we ended up having a nice conversation about our favorite meals and restaurants instead.

I genuinely just wanted to share a meal with my friends without feeling judged. Was I wrong to ask Friend B to tone it down? I feel like it was a reasonable request to make the evening more enjoyable for everyone, but I’m worried that I might have hurt their feelings.",801,2127,0.77,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_88569,2023-12-23 00:00:00,NAH,2701,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My friend and I have been best friends since childhood, and we have a tradition of going on a weekend camping trip every summer. This year, I was really looking forward to it and had planned everything out, from the campsite to the meals. 

A week before our trip, my friend told me that their partner had a last-minute work obligation and they might not be able to come. I was disappointed but understood that work can be unpredictable. I told them that it was totally fine and that I still wanted to go, even if it meant going alone.

The day before our trip, my friend texted me saying they decided to go to the trip after all, but their partner would be joining us as well. I was excited but also slightly apprehensive since I hadn't spent much time with their partner, and I didn't want it to change the dynamic of our trip. 

When we arrived at the campsite, I tried to be friendly and inclusive, but I noticed that my friend was spending most of their time with their partner, and I felt a bit like a third wheel. I made a couple of jokes and tried to engage them both in the activities I had planned, but it felt awkward. 

By the end of the first day, I was feeling a little left out, and in a moment of frustration, I told my friend that I had planned this trip for the two of us and it felt like they were ignoring me. They apologized and said they were just trying to balance their time between me and their partner, but I could tell they were hurt by my comment.

We talked it out later, and both of us realized that it was a new dynamic and we were both trying to navigate it. I felt bad for expressing my feelings in a way that made them feel guilty, and they didn’t mean to exclude me.

Recently, we planned a weekend trip to the beach that we had all been looking forward to for months. A few days before the trip, one of my friends, Sarah, called me in tears and told me that her grandmother had passed away. She was devastated and mentioned that she wouldn’t be able to join us on the trip.

I felt torn because I knew how important this trip was for everyone, but I also didn’t want to pressure Sarah to come if she wasn’t ready. I expressed my condolences and suggested we could postpone the trip or do something different so she could join us. However, Sarah insisted that she wanted us to go and have fun without her. I told her we would miss her, but she was adamant about not wanting to hold us back.

The weekend came, and we ended up enjoying our time at the beach. We took plenty of pictures and shared them in our group chat, making sure to include messages for Sarah, letting her know we were thinking of her. After the trip, when I called Sarah to check in, she was upset that we had gone without her and felt isolated from the group. I explained that we wanted to be supportive of her choice to stay behind, but I felt guilty for going on the trip.

No one is the Asshole,"I hope this story makes sense, I'm posting from my phone and trying to clarify my thoughts.

So, a bit of background: I (29F) was raised by a single mom. Growing up, we didn’t have a lot of money, but my mom always did her best to provide for me. She never remarried, and for the most part, it was just the two of us.

Fast forward to a few years ago when my mom started dating someone, we’ll call him Tom. At first, I was happy for her; she seemed really content. But as their relationship progressed, I started feeling uneasy. Tom is nice enough, but we just never bonded. I’d see him on holidays and a few weekends, but we never really had any deep conversations or shared interests. He’s just a guy who loves my mom. 

Recently, my mom asked me if I would consider referring to Tom as my step-dad. I hesitated and said I wasn’t comfortable with that because, while I respect him, I didn’t feel like we had that kind of relationship. My mom seemed disappointed but said she understood.

Now, here’s the situation: at a recent family gathering, I overheard some relatives talking about how Tom is my step-dad. I felt the need to correct them, explaining that while I like Tom, I don’t see him as a father figure. Some were supportive, saying it made sense, while others seemed offended and said I should just let it go to keep the peace.

I really don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings, but I also want to be true to myself. I don’t see the point in pretending that he’s my step-dad when I don’t feel that way. AITA for correcting people when they refer to him as my step-dad, or should I just let it slide for the sake of family harmony? 

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses! I think I've come to realize that it’s okay to express my feelings about my relationship with Tom. I want to be respectful of my mom's feelings, but I also need to be true to how I feel. I appreciate everyone’s input!",435,808,0.85,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_38999,2022-01-30 00:00:00,NAH,1895,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So here’s the deal: I (16F) recently got into a heated argument with my best friend, Sarah (16F), over a group project we were working on for school. We had been paired with another classmate, Mike (16M), who was super laid-back about everything. Sarah and I both wanted to take charge and get a high grade, but things started to go south when we couldn’t agree on how to approach the project.

I suggested we divide the tasks based on our strengths, but Sarah wanted to do everything herself and just have Mike help her with minor things. I felt that was unfair, especially since we were supposed to split the work equally. When I brought this up, she accused me of trying to undermine her, which caught me off guard. I didn’t mean to come off that way—I just wanted to collaborate better.

During our argument, I raised my voice a bit and said some things I didn’t really mean, like how her desire to do everything was going to result in a mediocre project. It was a stressful situation, and I lost my temper. Afterward, I regretted how I handled it and apologized to her, but she’s been pretty distant since then.

I had been planning on staying with my older sister for a couple of months while I looked for a job and got settled in. We’ve always had a good relationship, and I was excited to spend some time together.

However, since I’ve been back, I’ve noticed that my sister and her husband have been having some pretty intense arguments. It’s not that unusual for couples to disagree, but their fights are loud and pretty aggressive. They often escalate to the point where I can hear them clearly from my room, and it’s starting to affect my sleep and overall mental well-being.

I tried to brush it off at first, thinking it was just a phase they were going through, but it’s been weeks now. I feel really uncomfortable bringing it up because I don’t want to interfere in their relationship, but I’ve also reached a point where I’m feeling stressed and anxious because of the constant tension in the house.

I had been considering talking to my sister about how the noise is affecting me, but I’m worried it might come off as me criticizing their relationship. I don’t want to make things worse or put her in a position where she feels she has to choose between me and her husband. 

A part of me wonders if it would just be better for me to find a place of my own sooner rather than later.

I’m a 23-year-old woman, and I’ve been living in the same city for my entire life. My best friend, Mia, and I have been inseparable since childhood. We went to school together, and now we both work at the same company. Recently, I’ve started to feel like I need more personal space and time to pursue some of my own interests, such as traveling and getting involved in local community projects.

Mia has always been a bit more dependent on our friendship. She often invites me to go out for dinner or hang out at her place, and I usually say yes because I care about her and enjoy our time together. However, I’ve noticed that I’ve been feeling overwhelmed and like I’m missing out on things I want to try on my own.

I had a conversation with Mia last week where I expressed that I wanted to start spending more time focusing on myself and pursuing personal interests. I mentioned I might not be able to hang out as often and suggested we plan specific days to meet instead of seeing each other every week.

Mia was really hurt by this. She told me it felt like I was abandoning her and that she relied on our friendship to feel connected. I reassured her that I wasn’t going anywhere and that I still valued our friendship deeply, but I needed to find a better balance for my own wellbeing.

Now, I’m feeling conflicted. I want to prioritize my personal growth, but I also don’t want to hurt Mia or make her feel neglected. I understand she might be feeling insecure about our friendship, but I believe that it’s important for both of us to have our own individual lives too.

Okay, hear me out. 

My partner has a large extended family who gets together for every holiday, and they absolutely love spending time together, which I think is great. However, I come from a small family where we didn't really celebrate holidays in the same way. I find the idea of large gatherings a bit overwhelming and stressful, especially when it comes to navigating the dynamics of so many people.

When we first started dating, I attended a few of these family gatherings, but I quickly realized that they drain my energy. I prefer celebrating holidays in a quieter, more intimate setting, even if that means just the two of us or with a couple of close friends. I communicated this to my partner, and while they were understanding, they still hope that I will eventually want to join their family celebrations.

This year, their family planned a big Thanksgiving gathering, and I told my partner that I would prefer to spend the day at home, cooking a special meal just for us. They were disappointed and felt like I was rejecting their family and traditions. I didn't mean to hurt their feelings; I just genuinely feel more comfortable in smaller settings.

I know that family is important to my partner, and I appreciate that they want to include me in their life, but I just can't bring myself to thrive in those large family dynamics. I feel bad for disappointing my partner, but I also feel like I should be allowed to celebrate in a way that makes me happy.

However, she recently asked me to be her maid of honor, which I was thrilled about until she revealed that she wanted a very specific bachelorette party that involves a weekend trip to a popular destination. She mentioned that she expects everyone in the bridal party to join in and cover their own costs for accommodations and activities, which adds up to quite a bit, considering travel expenses, food, and entertainment.

I’ve been dealing with some unexpected financial challenges lately, including medical bills and car repairs, which have made it tough for me to save money. I gently explained my situation to her, emphasizing how much I want to be there for her, but that I might not be able to afford this trip without putting myself in a difficult financial spot.

She seemed a bit taken aback and said she really wanted everyone to experience this weekend together, and that it was important to her to have all her closest friends there. I totally understand where she's coming from; she wants to celebrate this special time with the people she loves the most. 

I suggested perhaps doing something more local that might be more affordable for everyone or even a virtual celebration, where we could all still be involved without the added expense. She didn’t seem very receptive to these ideas, saying that it wouldn’t be the same.

I expressed my concerns to my parents, explaining that I want to enjoy the trip but cannot go all out financially, especially since my sister is still a student and has limited funds. They didn’t take it well. My mom got upset and said it was our responsibility to help create memories as a family, especially since they’ve spent so much on us in the past. My sister feels caught in the middle and doesn’t want to disappoint our parents, but she also understands my position.

In the end, I suggested a compromise: I would be happy to go on a shorter trip or a more affordable weekend getaway instead, which would allow us all to spend quality time together without the financial strain. My parents, however, are insisting on the original plan, and now I feel torn. I want to support their desire for a family vacation, but I also need to protect my financial stability.

So, AITA for standing my ground and suggesting an alternative while trying not to let the family dynamics get too strained?",905,2604,0.68,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_84436,2024-06-12 00:00:00,NAH,1812,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been together for a few years and recently moved into a new apartment together. We agreed to merge our belongings, but there was one area where we had a bit of a disagreement: our respective collections of books.

I have a passion for reading and have built a large collection of books over the years, many of which are signed editions or hold sentimental value. My partner is also an avid reader but has a much smaller collection. When we moved in, I suggested we keep my books on the main bookshelf in our living room, as it’s a central space and I like to show them off. My partner, however, wanted to create a cozy reading nook in the bedroom and thought it would be better to display our books there.

At first, I felt a little hurt that they didn’t want my books showcased in the living room, as I have always considered my collection a part of my identity. I expressed my concerns, explaining that I would love to have my books be a part of our shared space for both of us to enjoy. My partner was understanding but still felt that it would be more comfortable and personal to have them in the bedroom.

After some back and forth, we decided to compromise: we would display a selection of my favorite books in the living room and the rest could go to the reading nook. I also agreed to let my partner choose some of their favorite books to display alongside mine in the living room. This way, we both felt represented in our shared living space.

Ultimately, I think we both learned a lot about communication and compromise from this experience. My partner understands how much my books mean to me, and I see the value in creating a space that feels like home for both of us.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I’m a 19-year-old college student and I’ve always been passionate about music. I play guitar and sing, and I’ve been performing at open mic nights at local cafes for a couple of years now. It’s something I truly love, and I’ve always dreamt of sharing my music with a wider audience.

Recently, I was given an opportunity to perform at a small local festival that supports emerging artists. I was beyond excited! I told my family and friends about it, and they were all thrilled for me, especially my younger brother, who looks up to me a lot.

However, when I mentioned the festival to my parents, they seemed less enthusiastic. They told me that they were worried about me performing in front of a large crowd, as they thought it might be too stressful for me. They expressed concerns about my confidence and the potential for getting rejected or criticized by people I didn’t know. They suggested that maybe I should focus on my studies instead and pursue music later, when I’m more established.

I felt really hurt by their lack of support. I understand that they’re coming from a place of love and concern, but music is my passion, and I want to give it a shot now. I tried to explain how much this opportunity means to me and how I’ve worked hard to get to this point, but they remained adamant about their worries.

After some back-and-forth, I decided to go ahead and perform at the festival anyway. I told them that I appreciate their concern, but I need to follow my dreams. I think they were disappointed and upset with my decision, and I feel guilty for going against their wishes. 

Now, I’m wondering if I should have listened to them and put my music aspirations on hold, or if I made the right choice by standing my ground and pursuing what I love. AITA?",745,863,0.61,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_35536,2018-09-25 00:00:00,NAH,1774,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Hi, I’m using a throwaway account because this situation is quite sensitive and I don’t want to stir up any drama.

**Backstory:** I (28F) have a close-knit group of friends from college. We've known each other for about a decade. One of my friends, Sarah (27F), has been in a long-term relationship with Mark (30M) for the past three years. Recently, their relationship hit a rough patch, and I've been supportive of Sarah, listening to her concerns and offering advice.

A few weeks ago, Mark reached out to me, expressing that he felt really lost and was unsure how to make things work with Sarah. He asked if we could meet up to talk about it. I agreed, thinking I could provide some perspective since I know both of them well. During our conversation, he shared his feelings of inadequacy and frustration, and I tried to encourage him to communicate openly with Sarah.

As we talked, I realized that Mark was genuinely trying to understand where things went wrong. I went home afterward feeling like I’d done something good, thinking that maybe I could help bridge the gap between them. However, I didn’t mention this conversation to Sarah because I didn’t want to create any unnecessary tension or seem like I was taking sides.

A few days later, Sarah found out that Mark and I had met up without her knowing. She confronted me, feeling betrayed that I hadn't informed her. I explained my reasoning, but she was still upset and accused me of overstepping by discussing their relationship with him without her knowledge.

Now, I’m feeling conflicted. I thought I was helping, but I understand Sarah’s feelings of betrayal. I just didn’t want to add fuel to the fire. I care about both of them and want to see them happy, whether together or apart.

No one is the Asshole,"I (30F) recently got engaged to my partner (32M), and we're in the midst of planning our wedding. My fiancé has a younger sister, Emily (24F), who has always struggled with her self-esteem and body image. I've always tried to be supportive of her, but I’ve noticed that she often seeks validation in unhealthy ways, particularly through social media.

As part of our wedding planning, I asked my fiancé if we could keep our wedding guest list small and intimate, including only close family and friends. He agreed, and we started sending out invitations. I decided to invite my best friend, Sarah (31F), who has a great eye for fashion and has offered to help me with my wedding dress. However, when Emily found out that Sarah was invited, she became upset. She expressed that she felt overshadowed by Sarah's confidence and style and was worried that she would compare herself to her on the wedding day.

I felt bad for Emily, but I also wanted to honor my friendship with Sarah, who has been a huge support to me throughout this process. I tried to reassure Emily that she is beautiful and loved, and that the day is about celebrating our love, not about appearances. I even offered to include her in some wedding planning activities to help her feel more involved and valued.

Despite my efforts, Emily remained upset and accused me of not considering her feelings. I can see that she is struggling, but I don’t want to compromise my friendship either. I genuinely care about Emily and want her to feel included, but I also believe she needs to work on her self-esteem in a healthy way.

So, am I the asshole for wanting to invite my best friend to my wedding despite my fiancé’s sister’s feelings about it? It feels like a complex situation, and I don’t want to hurt anyone, but I also want to celebrate this important day with the people who mean the most to me.",845,1098,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_91568,2018-08-11 00:00:00,NAH,1867,AITA

However, a few days before we were set to leave, my partner's grandmother fell ill and was hospitalized. My partner was understandably worried and wanted to stay home to be with her family during this tough time.

I suggested that we could still go on the trip, and I could go alone if he felt he needed to be with his family. He was torn but eventually agreed that I should go, as he understood it was a special occasion for us. I tried to reassure him that everything would be okay and that he should spend time with his family without worrying about me.

During the trip, I found myself enjoying the peaceful surroundings, but I also felt guilty for being away while my partner was dealing with a family crisis. I checked in regularly, and my partner kept telling me to enjoy myself and that it was okay for me to be away. 

However, on the last night of my trip, I received a call from my partner saying that his grandmother had passed away. He was devastated, and I felt awful for being away during such a critical moment. When I returned home, he expressed a mix of sadness and frustration, saying that he wished I had chosen to stay with him rather than go on the trip.

I felt conflicted because I had done my best to support him while also wanting to celebrate our anniversary. Neither of us wanted to hurt the other, but the situation was difficult.

One day, I decided to organize a small get-together at my place, inviting a few mutual friends. I thought it would be a nice break for her and a way for us to reconnect. I didn’t mention it to her beforehand, thinking it would be a pleasant surprise. 

When she arrived, she seemed caught off guard and a bit overwhelmed. She smiled and tried to join in, but I could see she was not really in the mood. After a while, she pulled me aside and expressed that she appreciated the gesture but felt pressured by the social gathering when she was already feeling drained from work. I apologized and reassured her that I only wanted her to have fun and didn’t mean to add to her stress.

After the get-together, we talked more about her feelings, and I realized that while my intentions were good, I hadn’t fully understood how she was feeling. I promised to be more mindful of her needs moving forward.

No one is the Asshole,"Last weekend, my son, who is 13, invited a few friends over for a sleepover. One of his friends, who we'll call Jake, has a reputation for being a bit of a prankster. I’ve met him a few times, and while he seems like a nice kid, I’ve heard from other parents that he sometimes takes things too far. 

As the evening went on, I noticed Jake was getting a bit rowdy with my son and the other kids. They were playing video games, and Jake kept suggesting increasingly outrageous dares for them to do. At first, it was harmless fun, but then he suggested they go outside and run through the sprinklers in the middle of the night, which could easily lead to someone getting hurt or sick.

I decided to step in and told the kids that they could play games indoors, but no more dares. I explained that while I appreciated their enthusiasm, I was concerned about someone getting hurt or damaging something outside. Jake didn’t take this well and started making fun of me, saying I was a “buzzkill” in front of the others.

I tried to keep my cool and told him that I understood he was just trying to have fun, but I had to enforce some rules for everyone’s safety. He retaliated by saying he would just tell my son to sneak out later, which made me nervous. I didn’t want to ruin the night, but I also wanted to ensure everyone was safe and respected my house rules.

After that, the atmosphere changed, and the kids seemed a bit uncomfortable. Eventually, they decided to go to bed, but I could tell that Jake’s comments had made things tense. I felt bad for putting my son in a position where he might feel embarrassed in front of his friend.

The next day, I talked to my son about it and asked how he felt about Jake’s behavior. He said he understood why I stepped in but felt bad that his friend was upset.

Everything was going smoothly until one of our friends, let's call him Mark, brought his dog with him. We had agreed beforehand that pets weren't allowed since we have a friend who is highly allergic to dogs, but Mark insisted that his dog was “hypoallergenic” and wouldn’t cause any issues.

I tried to be polite but reiterated our house rule about no pets. Mark got defensive, arguing that his dog was well-behaved and wouldn’t cause any problems. I could see that he genuinely didn’t want to leave his dog at home. After a few minutes of back-and-forth, I suggested that he could keep his dog in the car for the night, and I didn’t think that was unreasonable considering the situation.

I completely understand why they want to pursue this, and I support their ambitions. However, I have some reservations.

I love my current job and the community we’ve built here. Plus, I have family and friends nearby who provide a strong support system.

I’ve voiced my concerns to my partner, emphasizing how much I value my current life and how hard it would be for me to leave everything behind.

We had a long discussion about it, and while my partner feels that this opportunity is a once-in-a-lifetime chance and is determined to take it, they also expressed that they don’t want to leave me behind.

It looked amazing. But when my boyfriend walked in, he was in his usual jeans and a t-shirt, looking completely out of place.

I noticed a few of our friends gave him a hard time for not dressing up, playfully calling him out for being the odd one out.

I suggested that he could come over one weekend just to hang out and get to know everyone, and then we could see if he felt comfortable joining in on the games afterward.

My cousin seemed disappointed but understood where I was coming from. However, when I talked to my friends about it, they had mixed feelings. Some were okay with him joining, while others were concerned that it would change the vibe of our game nights. I felt stuck between wanting to support my cousin and keeping the balance of our established group.

No one is the Asshole,"So I’ll keep this brief and provide a TLDR at the end.

I (28f) have a close group of friends that I’ve known since college. We usually hang out every weekend and have a lot of shared interests. Recently, one of my friends, Sarah (27f), has started dating someone new. We’ve met him a couple of times, and while he seems nice enough, he’s not exactly fitting into our dynamic. 

Last weekend, Sarah invited us over for a game night and brought her boyfriend with her. The vibe was a bit off – he didn’t really engage with any of us and kept making comments that felt dismissive about our inside jokes. At one point, I tried to include him in a conversation, but he just brushed it off and started checking his phone. It made the evening awkward, and I could see my friends felt the same way.

At one point, I jokingly said, “So, are you always this much of a buzzkill, or is it just with us?” I meant it in jest, but it clearly struck a nerve. He got defensive and said he felt out of place. Sarah then pulled me aside and asked me to apologize. I felt bad because I didn’t mean to hurt him, but I also thought he could have made more of an effort to fit in instead of just sitting there.

After talking it over with my friends later, they agreed that it was a tense situation, and while my comment wasn’t the best, they understood my frustration. Sarah and I had a bit of a falling out over it, but ultimately, we talked it through. She acknowledged it was a tough situation for her boyfriend as well and that she appreciated that I didn’t mean to offend.

TLDR: I made a joke to a friend’s boyfriend during game night that upset him. It was awkward, but I think we all had a role in the tension and resolved it later. 

Edit: Just to clarify, Sarah and I are good now! We talked about how to better integrate her boyfriend into our group in the future.",308,2634,0.89,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_19275,2022-02-06 00:00:00,NAH,1854,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I've always been close with my sister, and we share a lot of our lives with each other. We both have our quirks, and while we sometimes clash, we generally get along well. Recently, my sister started dating someone she really likes. They've been seeing each other for a few months, and I could tell she was quite smitten.

One evening, while we were hanging out, she casually mentioned that she was planning to introduce her boyfriend to our parents. I felt a twinge of protectiveness and decided to express my concerns. I told her that I didn't think he was a good fit for her because he seemed a bit too pushy and not very respectful of her boundaries. I based my opinion on a couple of interactions I had with him at family gatherings, where he made some jokes that I found inappropriate.

My sister got upset and said that I was being judgmental and that she needed to make her own decisions. I apologized and said I would support her choice, but I still felt uneasy about her relationship. A few days later, she invited me to dinner with her and her boyfriend. I went, hoping to see if my concerns were valid.

During dinner, things went reasonably well, but I still felt a little uncomfortable with how he interacted with her. After the dinner, I told her that while I respected her choice, I still felt the need to express my concerns about how he treated her. She got really frustrated and said that I was overstepping and that she didn’t want me to interfere in her relationship.

In the end, I agreed to drop the topic, but I still worry about her. I love my sister and want what's best for her. Was I wrong for trying to look out for her, or was she justified in her reaction?",835,2192,0.5,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_95477,2018-05-16 00:00:00,NAH,1687,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Throwaway account, just in case.

I’m a 16-year-old girl and I have a close-knit group of friends that I’ve known since elementary school. Recently, one of my friends, Sarah, started dating a new guy, Jake. At first, I was happy for her, but then I noticed that she started to change a bit. She became way more distant and started canceling plans with us to hang out with Jake instead.

One weekend, we had planned a movie night at my house, and Sarah canceled last minute because she wanted to go out with Jake. I was disappointed, but I understood that she was excited about the new relationship. However, as the weeks went on, this became a pattern. It felt like we were losing our friendship, and I missed spending time with her.

I decided to reach out to her and express how I felt. I texted her saying that I missed her and wished we could spend more time together, just the two of us, like we used to. I didn't mean to come off as demanding, but I think my message might have been interpreted that way.

When we finally met up to talk, she seemed defensive and said she was happy with Jake and that I should be supportive of her new relationship. I told her that I was happy for her, but I just wanted to maintain our friendship too. We ended up having a bit of a heated discussion, and it was clear we both felt misunderstood.

After our talk, we were able to cool down and agree to try to balance things out. She promised to make time for the group, and I agreed to be more understanding about her relationship. I think we both realized that it was important to communicate better going forward.

I still feel a bit guilty for bringing it up, as I didn’t want to come off as the jealous friend. So, I’m wondering if I was wrong to approach her about this or if I was justified in wanting to maintain our friendship.

No one is the Asshole,"I’ve always enjoyed cooking, and I often host dinner parties for friends. A few weeks ago, I decided to invite my close friends over for a themed dinner night. I wanted to make it extra special, so I planned a fancy Italian menu with homemade pasta, sauces, and desserts.

A couple of days before the dinner, I reached out to my friend Sarah to see if she could help. Sarah loves cooking too, and I thought it would be fun to prepare the meal together. She agreed, and I shared the menu with her. However, I forgot to mention that I had already bought most of the ingredients since I wanted to surprise everyone with my cooking skills.

On the day of the dinner, Sarah arrived with a bag full of ingredients she had bought, thinking we would be using them together. I felt bad that I hadn't communicated clearly, but I assured her we could incorporate her stuff into the meal. We ended up making two different pasta dishes, which was fun, but it was a bit chaotic in the kitchen.

During the dinner, our friends enjoyed the food and had a great time. However, I noticed that Sarah seemed a bit upset about not being fully in control of the cooking process. After everyone left, she expressed that she felt like she’d been sidelined and that it was my dinner party, not ours. I apologized for not communicating well, and we talked it out. I understand her perspective, but I felt like the dinner turned out great and everyone enjoyed it.

Sarah has a cat, and I’m allergic. When we first moved in, I mentioned my allergy, and she assured me that she would keep the cat out of my room and clean up after it regularly. For the most part, she has kept her word, but I still find myself sneezing a lot and dealing with itchy eyes, especially when I come home after being gone for a while. 

Recently, I started feeling overwhelmed by my allergy symptoms, and I thought about moving out because it was affecting my health. I didn’t want to jeopardize our friendship, so I sat down with Sarah and explained the situation. I suggested we find a different living arrangement or that I might need to pay a lower share of the rent since I was having to manage my allergies on top of our usual living expenses. 

Sarah was really understanding and said she didn't want to lose our living arrangement either. She offered to help me find a doctor who could give me advice on managing my allergies and suggested that she could invest in some air purifiers and cleaning supplies to help with the cat hair. 

We ended up agreeing that I wouldn’t move out and that we’d both work together to find a solution. I felt relieved that we talked it out, and I appreciated her willingness to compromise.

No one is the Asshole,"Okay, here's my story:

For some context, I have a close-knit group of friends that I’ve known for several years. We usually hang out every weekend and take turns hosting each other at our homes. Recently, one of my friends, Jake, has been going through a tough time with his job and personal life, and he’s been feeling pretty down.

Last weekend, it was my turn to host, and I decided to make a big dinner. I really wanted to create a positive atmosphere, so I planned a nice meal and some fun activities to lift everyone’s spirits. I also thought it would be a good idea to invite a few other friends who don’t usually hang out with us, hoping to introduce some new energy into our group.

I let Jake know about the dinner and mentioned the extra friends I was inviting, thinking he might appreciate the change of pace. However, he seemed annoyed and told me he wasn’t in the mood for a big gathering and would prefer a quieter evening with just our usual group. I totally understood where he was coming from, but I was also excited about the dinner I had planned.

I tried to accommodate him by suggesting we could still have a smaller gathering on another night just for our usual friends, but he insisted he didn’t want to come at all if it was going to include the extra people. I felt caught between wanting to support my friend and wanting to enjoy the evening I had planned for everyone else.

When the dinner happened, I had a great time with the other friends who came, but I felt a bit bad knowing Jake was sitting at home alone. I reached out to him afterward to check in, and he expressed that he felt excluded and disappointed that I didn’t prioritize his feelings about the gathering.

Now I’m wondering if I should have just scrapped the idea of inviting others altogether or if it was reasonable to want to change things up a bit.

I love Alex, but I wasn't sure how I felt about adding another person to the mix, especially since I had already planned everything and didn’t have enough food and drink for an extra guest. 

I explained my concerns to Alex, emphasizing that I wanted to keep it an intimate gathering. I suggested that maybe we could plan a separate get-together soon where he could bring his partner. Alex was a bit disappointed but understood my point of view. 

On the day of the gathering, Alex showed up alone, but I could tell he was still feeling a bit uncomfortable about the whole situation. The night went well overall, but I felt a lingering tension knowing that he was disappointed. 

In the end, I don’t think I was wrong for wanting to keep the gathering small, but I also felt bad for unintentionally hurting Alex's feelings.

No one is the Asshole,"Last month, my partner and I decided to host a game night with some friends at our apartment. We love having people over, and it’s always a great time. We invited three friends, and everyone was excited about it.

A few days before the event, one of our friends, Sarah, mentioned that she was bringing her new boyfriend, whom none of us had met yet. We were all curious to meet him, and I was happy to accommodate.

When game night arrived, everything was going smoothly. We were playing board games, laughing, and generally having a great time. However, during the evening, I noticed that Sarah's boyfriend, Jake, was a bit on the quiet side. He seemed to be enjoying himself, but he was also not engaging much with the group.

I thought it might help if I included him more in the conversation, so I asked him about his interests and hobbies. He responded politely but gave very short answers. It was clear he was a bit shy. I felt awkward and wanted to make him feel welcome, but I also didn’t want to put him on the spot.

As the night went on, I could see that Sarah was starting to look a bit uncomfortable. She later pulled me aside and told me that Jake actually has social anxiety and often struggles in new situations. She appreciated that I tried to include him, but she felt that the pressure of being the center of attention was overwhelming for him.

I immediately felt bad for not realizing it sooner. I apologized to Sarah, and we decided to tone down the pace of the evening and focus on more relaxed games that required less interaction. Jake ended up opening up a bit more, and we all had a good time, but I still felt guilty for not being more mindful of his situation from the beginning.

I’m wondering if I should have known better and adjusted sooner, or if it was just a situation where everyone was trying to have a good time and sometimes things don’t go as planned. What do you think?",298,625,0.5,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_17462,2022-06-21 00:00:00,NAH,1911,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"A few weeks ago, I had a situation with my roommate that escalated into an argument. We share a small apartment, and we usually have an unspoken rule about keeping the common areas tidy. I’ve always been the one to take care of the cleaning, mostly because I enjoy it, but I don’t mind doing it if it means our space stays nice.

One Saturday morning, I woke up early and decided to do a deep clean of the living room and kitchen. I was vacuuming and dusting when my roommate came out of his room, clearly annoyed. He was still half-asleep and asked me if I could keep it down because he had just gone to bed after a late shift the night before. I understood where he was coming from, but I also thought that it was a reasonable time to clean on a weekend.

Instead of backing down, I explained that I was trying to tidy up our shared space. I mentioned that I usually clean during the week when he’s at work, but I had some free time that morning. I thought I could finish quickly and then we could both enjoy a nice clean apartment. My roommate felt I was being inconsiderate of his need for sleep, and I felt he was being unfair for wanting me to hold off on cleaning when it needed to be done.

The discussion turned a bit heated, and in the moment, I raised my voice, which escalated the tension. After a few minutes of back-and-forth, we both realized that we were being a bit stubborn. I took a step back and apologized for raising my voice—I didn’t mean to come off as disrespectful. He also apologized for being grumpy and acknowledged that he could have just gone back to sleep instead of confronting me.

In the end, we reached a compromise: I agreed to clean during more considerate hours, and he promised to communicate better when he needed some quiet time. It was a learning experience for both of us, and we ended up laughing about it later.

I want the shower to be a family-friendly event, and I've decided to make it a potluck where everyone brings a dish to share. My thought was to create a relaxed atmosphere where everyone can enjoy themselves, and the kids can play together.

Now, here's where the issue comes in. One of my friends (31F), who has two young children, expressed that she feels uncomfortable bringing her kids to a gathering where there will be foods that might not cater to their preferences. She suggested I provide a variety of kid-friendly options, like chicken nuggets or mac and cheese, to ensure everyone can eat without hassle. I totally understand her concern, but I also want to keep things simple and let people bring dishes they enjoy.

I told her that I appreciate her input, but I can't control what everyone brings and that I believe it’s part of the fun to have a mix of different foods. She responded by saying that she might not attend if there isn't food her kids will eat. I genuinely want her to be there, but I also feel like I shouldn't have to change my plans just to accommodate specific tastes.

I’ve talked to a few other friends who agree that a potluck is about sharing personal favorites and trying new things. No one can please everyone, and I don’t want to restrict the menu to just kids' foods.

So, AITA for not providing kid-friendly options at my baby shower?

I immediately offered to help clean it up, and Jake seemed a bit embarrassed. I reassured him that it was no big deal, and we started working on it together. While we were cleaning, I accidentally knocked over a bowl of chips, sending them all over the floor. We both burst out laughing at the mess we created, and it lightened the mood. 

However, later that night, Sarah pulled me aside and told me that Jake felt uncomfortable about how I had taken over the cleaning process. She said he was raised to handle his own messes and that he felt like I was undermining him. I didn’t mean to overstep, and it was all in good fun, but I completely understood where she was coming from.

I apologized to her for making Jake feel uncomfortable and promised to be more mindful of boundaries in the future. After talking it over, Sarah said I wasn’t an asshole, but she appreciated me checking in with her. It was a learning moment for me, and I want to ensure Jake feels welcome in our friend group. 

AITA for trying to help and accidentally making Jake feel uncomfortable? It was all unintentional, and I really did just want to lighten the mood.",847,2285,0.58,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_46763,2023-06-08 00:00:00,NAH,1682,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Hi, I’m writing this on a throwaway because I’m feeling really mixed up about a recent family situation.

**Backstory:** I (30F) have a close relationship with my younger brother (24M). We’ve always been there for each other through thick and thin. Recently, he started dating a girl (23F) who seems great, but she has a different background and some different perspectives on family dynamics. 

They’ve been together for about six months, and I’ve tried to welcome her into our family. However, I've noticed that she has a tendency to dismiss family traditions and activities that I value, and it’s been bothering me. For example, we have a family game night every month that I’ve organized for years, and she suggested we replace that with outings that only focus on her interests. I felt uncomfortable and expressed that I wanted to keep some of our traditions alive, which led to a mild argument.

The situation escalated when I mentioned this to my brother. He seemed to take her side, saying I needed to be more open-minded about her views. I felt hurt because I always thought we could discuss things openly. In the heat of the moment, I might have come off too strong and said that if she couldn't respect our family traditions, maybe she shouldn't be part of the family. 

Afterwards, I felt really guilty. I didn't mean to attack her or put my brother in a tough spot. I just wanted to express my feelings about our traditions being important to me. I have since apologized to both of them, but now there’s a lingering tension, and I’m not sure how to navigate it moving forward.

**TLDR: I clashed with my brother’s girlfriend over family traditions, expressed my feelings in a way that might have hurt her, and now I feel guilty about putting my brother in the middle. I don’t know how to mend things.** 

**EDIT:** Thank you for all the feedback! I’m working on finding a way to talk to both of them together to clear the air.",971,2849,0.57,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_71209,2021-09-18 00:00:00,NAH,1939,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Hello,

Backstory: I recently started a new job and I’m still getting accustomed to the work culture and my responsibilities. My team has been very supportive, and I’m grateful for that. However, one of my colleagues, Sarah, who has been working here for a while, has been struggling with her workload. She often seems overwhelmed, and I’ve noticed she’s been working late quite a bit.

Last week, I overheard her talking to another colleague about how she was stressed and wished she had someone to help her out with some of her tasks. I felt empathy for her situation since I remember how tough it was for me during my first few weeks. So, I offered to help her with a project that was due soon. She initially hesitated but then accepted my offer, and we spent a few hours working together.

During our time working on the project, I noticed that it was not just the workload that was stressing her out; she also seemed to be dealing with some personal issues, which she briefly touched on. I encouraged her to take breaks and even suggested we grab a coffee, which she appreciated. 

After we finished the project, she expressed her gratitude and mentioned that she felt much better having someone to share the workload and talk to, even if just for a little while. I was happy to help, and I felt good about being supportive.

However, I later learned that some of my other colleagues were talking about how I was “taking over” Sarah’s work and that I should focus on my own tasks instead. I didn’t mean to overstep, and I genuinely wanted to help. I’m now feeling confused and a bit guilty, wondering if I should have just kept to myself.

In the end, I think both Sarah and I benefited from the situation, but I’m unclear if I overstepped my boundaries in trying to assist her.

So, AITA for offering to help my overwhelmed colleague when I saw she was struggling?",617,1837,0.64,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_47933,2024-07-10 00:00:00,NAH,1870,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I'm a high school teacher, and I've always believed that building a good rapport with my students is essential for a productive learning environment. This year, I decided to implement a weekly ""Fun Friday"" where we would have a relaxed class session at the end of the week. It was intended to be a time for students to unwind, engage in games, or work on creative projects, while still reinforcing the lessons we covered during the week.

I made it clear that attendance was optional, and it would be a laid-back environment. The first few weeks went great, and students seemed to enjoy it. However, over time, participation started to dwindle. I noticed that the few students who showed up were often the same ones, while others made excuses or simply didn’t show. I was disappointed because I genuinely wanted everyone to have a good time and take a break from the usual structure.

After a month of this, I announced that I would be ending the ""Fun Friday"" sessions due to low turnout, hoping to redirect my efforts into more engaging lesson plans. Some students were upset and expressed their disappointment, saying they had wanted to come but had forgotten or had other commitments. They felt like I was giving up on something they enjoyed.

I felt conflicted about my decision. I wanted to create an enjoyable experience for my students, but I also needed to recognize when something wasn't working. Was I wrong for cancelling the event when some students were clearly disappointed? Am I the asshole for trying to do something fun that not everyone appreciated?",240,998,0.54,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_13071,2019-12-29 00:00:00,NAH,1567,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Last month, my sister called me in a panic. Her daughter, who is five, had accidentally broken a flower pot that had belonged to our grandmother, who passed away a few years ago. The pot was special to all of us, and my sister was worried about how I would react because I had been particularly fond of it. 

When my sister told me, I could hear the distress in her voice. She expressed guilt and concern, feeling she might have put too much pressure on her daughter to be careful. I reassured her that it was just a flower pot, and while it held sentimental value, it was ultimately just a thing. I suggested we could try to fix it or find a way to preserve its memory without focusing too much on the loss.

A few days later, my sister and her daughter came over to visit. They brought with them some flowers and a small box where they had placed the broken pieces of the pot. My niece was visibly upset and kept apologizing, saying she didn’t mean to break it. I knelt down to her level and hugged her, telling her it was okay and that accidents happen. We talked about how we could remember our grandmother by planting new flowers together in a different pot.

We spent the afternoon painting a new pot together, which my niece loved. We also made a little memory garden in the backyard, placing the broken pieces of the old pot around it as a way to honor our grandmother's memory. My sister and I ended up laughing and sharing stories about Grandma, and my niece joined in with her innocent observations.

In the end, it turned out to be a beautiful bonding experience rather than something to dwell on. My sister thanked me for my understanding and for helping her daughter feel better about the situation. I realized that while the pot was important, the memories we create together were what truly mattered.",452,1210,0.76,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_47983,2019-04-01 00:00:00,NAH,1816,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"For some context, my best friend and I have been close since childhood. We’ve always supported each other through everything, and I value our friendship deeply. Recently, however, we hit a bump in the road.

My friend is a passionate gamer and has been developing a new indie game for the past couple of years. I’ve always admired his dedication and creativity. He invited me to playtest it, which I was excited about. However, the game is really different from what I usually play, and I found it challenging to get into. 

During the playtest, I could tell he was really invested in my feedback. When I struggled with certain mechanics, I hesitated to mention it at first because I didn’t want to hurt his feelings. Eventually, though, I felt I had to be honest. I told him that I appreciated the creativity but found some parts frustrating and that I thought the controls were a bit clunky.

He seemed to take my feedback hard, and after that, the atmosphere shifted. He became quieter and more withdrawn. I tried to reassure him that I believed in his project, but he seemed to be upset that I didn’t enjoy it the way he hoped I would. 

We ended up having a conversation about it a few days later. He expressed that he felt like I didn’t understand his vision and that my feedback felt like a rejection of his work. I reassured him that it wasn’t personal—it's just that the game was outside my usual taste. I even suggested that he show it to a few other friends who might be more aligned with the genre.

In the end, we both agreed that we valued each other’s perspectives, even if they didn’t always align. It was a tough moment for both of us, but I think we’re working through it. I really want to support him in his passion, and I hope he can see that my honesty came from a place of care.

So, AITA for giving my honest feedback on my friend's game, even if it hurt his feelings?",262,610,0.54,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_83722,2021-12-28 00:00:00,NAH,1891,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"When I was twenty-five, I started working at a local coffee shop, and I quickly became friends with a co-worker named Alex. We bonded over our love for music and started hanging out more outside of work. After a few months, we realized we had feelings for each other and began dating.

Around that time, my grandmother, who had been battling dementia for several years, took a turn for the worse. I was incredibly close to her, and the news hit me hard. As I juggled my job and caring for my grandmother, my relationship with Alex started to suffer. I found it hard to balance everything, and I was emotionally drained.

One weekend, when my grandmother was particularly unwell, I was unable to see Alex. Instead of communicating why I was distant, I withdrew further. Alex, feeling neglected and hurt, decided to go out with friends instead. Unfortunately, they ended up at a bar where a mutual acquaintance, Jamie, was also hanging out. While I trusted Alex, I felt a pang of jealousy when I learned they had shared a few drinks and danced together. 

A few days later, I finally opened up to Alex about what I was going through with my grandmother. They were incredibly understanding and supportive, which made me feel guilty for not sharing sooner. However, when I later mentioned learning about their night out with Jamie, Alex felt cornered. They assured me nothing happened, but I still felt insecure about it.

In the end, we had a heartfelt conversation. We both realized that we were dealing with our own struggles and hadn't communicated well enough. I apologized for shutting them out during such a difficult time, and Alex apologized for not being more considerate about how I might feel.

No one was at fault, and we both learned a lot about communication and support. Now, we’re in a better place in our relationship, but it made me wonder if I was wrong for feeling the way I did.

No one is the Asshole,"Today, my friend reached out to me in a panic. Her partner had just been diagnosed with a serious illness, and she was struggling to cope. She asked if I could come over, as she really needed someone to talk to and support her. I completely understood where she was coming from; I’ve been there myself. However, I had already committed to helping my elderly neighbor, who needed assistance organizing her home and preparing meals for the week. 

I debated for a moment, but I decided to honor my commitment to my neighbor. She has no family nearby and relies heavily on me for help, especially since she’s been feeling unwell. I texted my friend to let her know I was there for her but couldn’t come over right away. I suggested she reach out to someone else or maybe even find a support group online.

When I finished helping my neighbor, I checked in with my friend. She was upset and felt like I chose my neighbor over her. I felt torn; I wanted to be there for both of them but knew that my neighbor’s situation also mattered. I felt bad that my decision hurt my friend, but I couldn’t abandon my neighbor when she needed me.

In the end, I think I made the right choice for my circumstances, though it left me feeling conflicted.

Recently, Tom started dating this girl, Lisa, who is really sweet but a bit shy and quiet. I’ve noticed that when we're all together, Tom tends to dominate conversations, and Lisa often just sits back and listens.

Last weekend, we were all at a coffee shop, and I tried to include Lisa in the conversation by asking her about her hobbies and interests. Tom, who seemed to be in a playful mood, interrupted me and jokingly said, “Oh, she doesn’t really have any hobbies, she just likes to watch TV.” I laughed it off, but I could see Lisa's face drop a bit. I thought it was just a joke, but later on, I noticed she seemed a little uncomfortable for the rest of the meetup.

After we left, I reached out to her privately to check in and see if she was okay. She mentioned that she felt a bit overshadowed and that Tom's joke had made her feel like her interests didn’t matter. I told her that I really appreciated her perspective and that I’d bring it up to Tom in a constructive way next time we hung out.

When I did talk to Tom about it, he seemed surprised and said he didn’t mean to put her down. He thought it was just harmless banter. We had a good conversation about making sure everyone feels included, and he agreed to be more mindful of that in the future.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently found myself in a bit of a conflict with my neighbor, and I'm trying to figure out if I'm at fault here.

A few weeks ago, I noticed that my neighbor's dog was barking excessively late at night. At first, I tried to ignore it, thinking maybe it was a one-time thing. But as the nights went on, it became a regular occurrence. The barking would often start around 11 PM and go on for a couple of hours, making it really hard for me and my family to get a good night's sleep.

After about a week of this, I decided to talk to my neighbor. I approached him calmly and mentioned that his dog had been barking quite a bit at night. I let him know that it was causing some disturbance in our home. He seemed surprised and apologetic, saying he had no idea the barking was that bad and promised to look into it.

However, the barking continued, and I found myself getting increasingly frustrated. I tried to be patient since I understood that dogs can be unpredictable, but after another week, I reached a breaking point. I sent him a polite message through our neighborhood group chat, explaining how the barking was affecting my family and asking if he could please find a solution.

This time, he responded defensively, saying I was overreacting and that dogs bark sometimes. He felt like I was being unreasonable for expecting him to control his pet, and that I should just deal with it. It turned into a larger discussion in the group chat, with some neighbors sympathizing with me and others defending him.

In the end, I felt a bit guilty for escalating it to the group chat, even though I thought I had a valid concern. I didn't mean to create tension in the neighborhood, but I also wanted to advocate for my family's well-being. Now I'm left wondering if I overstepped by bringing it to a public forum or if I was justified in seeking a resolution.

We often chat when we see each other outside, and we’ve helped each other out with small favors like watching pets or borrowing tools. She's always been very friendly, and we’ve built a nice little rapport.

Recently, I noticed that she started a new exercise group in our neighborhood and had been posting about it on social media. I was happy for her and thought it was a great way for people to connect and get fit together. However, I also noticed that a few of our mutual friends weren’t included in this group, and I wondered why.

Over coffee one day, I casually brought it up, saying, “I saw you started that exercise group! It looks awesome! I noticed a few people from our circle aren’t involved, though. What’s the story there?” 

Lisa immediately became a bit tense and explained that she wanted to keep it a small group for now and that she had her reasons for not including everyone. I could tell she wasn't comfortable talking about it, so I quickly changed the subject.

After our chat, I felt a bit bad for asking. I thought I was just being friendly and curious, but I realized that I might have unintentionally put her in an awkward position. I reached out to her later to apologize if I overstepped and assured her that I completely understood if she wanted to keep things private.

Lisa was very understanding and said she appreciated my concern. We both agreed it was a bit of a sensitive topic, and there were no hard feelings. In the end, I felt relieved that we could talk it out, but I still wonder if I was out of line for asking in the first place.

No one is the Asshole,"So I’ll keep this brief and if I start rambling, I’ll put a TLDR down below.

My partner (28f) and I (29m) have been together for about three years, and we generally get along really well. We share a lot of interests, including a passion for hiking and traveling, and we frequently take weekend trips to explore nature. We also both have a goofy sense of humor, which makes our relationship lighthearted and fun.

Recently, we decided to take a trip to a national park that we both love. We had planned this for weeks, and I was really looking forward to it. However, the day before our trip, my partner came down with a bad cold. She insisted that she would still be able to go, but I was concerned about her health and the fact that we would be spending a lot of time outdoors in potentially chilly weather.

I suggested that we postpone our trip for a few weeks until she was feeling better. I thought it was a reasonable idea since we could still enjoy the trip when she was back to her normal self. She, however, was adamant about going, stating that she didn’t want to miss out on the trip we had planned for so long.

After going back and forth, I ultimately decided to respect her wishes and said we could go as planned, but I would keep a close eye on her and make sure she didn’t overexert herself. During the trip, I tried to help her whenever I could, but it was clear that she was struggling with her cold. I felt guilty for letting her push through when I thought she should rest.

Now, she’s feeling better and told me that she was glad we went, but also expressed frustration that I suggested postponing it in the first place. I understand her perspective, but I still feel like I was trying to look out for her health.

L and I are both in our late 20s now, and while I’ve moved on to a more career-focused life, L has been more laid back, living in a small town and not pursuing a traditional career.

About a year ago, I invited L to my wedding. We weren’t as close after some disagreements we had over the years, particularly about personal responsibility and ambition, which L felt I was judging her for. Still, I wanted to keep the family connection, and I thought the wedding would be a good chance to reconnect.

The day of the wedding came, and L showed up with a plus-one. I wasn’t aware she was bringing someone, and when I saw them, I felt a bit uneasy.

I was hurt, but I didn’t want to ruin the day by confronting them in front of everyone. Instead, I decided to talk to L privately the next day. I expressed how I felt about her date's behavior and how it impacted my special day.

When Sarah arrived, she brought a beautiful vegan lasagna, which looked amazing. Everyone was really eager to try it, but when we sat down to eat, I accidentally made a comment about how I loved ""real"" cheese and how I didn't think I could ever go fully vegan. I meant it as a light-hearted joke, but I could see Sarah's face fall a bit. 

After dinner, a couple of friends started discussing their dietary choices, and Sarah brought up how important it is to her to avoid animal products. I realized my comment might have come off as dismissive, even though I didn't mean it that way. I quickly apologized and told her I appreciated her effort in bringing a delicious dish.

When I arrived, I noticed that one of our friends, Alex, was particularly quiet. I found out later that he was going through a tough time after a recent breakup, and while I wanted to support him, I didn't want to overwhelm him either.

As the night went on, we all started playing some games and sharing stories. I noticed that Alex seemed to perk up a little as the evening progressed, but he still looked a bit withdrawn.

I chuckled as I recalled how I accidentally got lost while hiking, and how it turned into a hilarious adventure.

He looked surprised but then opened up a little about his situation. I made sure to listen and offer support without pushing him to talk more than he was comfortable with.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I recently organized a small gathering at my apartment to celebrate my promotion. I invited a few close friends, and we were all really looking forward to it. One of my friends, Alex, mentioned that he wanted to bring his new girlfriend, who I hadn’t met yet. I thought that was fine, and I told him it would be great to have her join us.

The day of the gathering came, and I was busy preparing food and drinks. When Alex arrived, he brought along his girlfriend, but he also had another friend, Jamie, who I hadn’t been told about. Jamie seemed friendly enough, but I was caught off guard because I had planned for a specific number of people and had prepared food accordingly.

As the night went on, I noticed that Jamie was kind of dominating the conversation and not really giving others a chance to speak. It felt like my small celebration was turning more into Jamie's show, and I was getting a bit annoyed, but I didn’t want to create tension. I tried to steer the conversation back to my promotion a couple of times, but it didn’t work.

At one point, I decided to pull Alex aside and gently mentioned how I felt overwhelmed by the unexpected addition and how I wished we could celebrate my achievement with a more intimate group. Alex seemed surprised and a bit defensive, saying he thought Jamie would add to the fun.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently had an experience with my younger brother (16) that I think is worth sharing. He’s been going through a tough time at school and has been feeling overwhelmed, which is completely understandable. We all have our moments, and I remember being in his shoes not too long ago.

Last weekend, he was supposed to go to a school event, but he texted me last minute saying he didn’t feel up to it. I could tell he was feeling really down, so I offered to take him out for ice cream instead. I thought it might lift his spirits a bit and give us a chance to talk.

When we got to the ice cream shop, he opened up about how stressful things have been for him lately, and I listened. I shared some of my own experiences and reassured him that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and that he doesn't have to handle everything on his own. We had a good conversation, and I think it helped him feel a bit better.

However, I noticed my brother’s friends were at the shop, and when they saw him with me, they teased him a bit for being out with his ""older brother."" I could see he was embarrassed, but I just chuckled along, trying to keep the mood light. After they left, he told me he appreciated me being there for him, but he also mentioned that he felt a bit silly for needing an ice cream outing to feel better.

I told him that it’s perfectly fine to lean on family when things get tough. I don't want him to feel ashamed for asking for help or support. I hope I did the right thing by being there for him, but I also wonder if I might have embarrassed him in front of his friends. Overall, I just want to be a supportive brother, and I hope he knows he can always talk to me.",590,2786,0.78,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_80606,2021-12-09 00:00:00,NAH,1672,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I recently moved to a new city for a job and didn't know anyone here. As I was settling in, I met a neighbor who seemed really friendly. She invited me over for coffee, and we got to chatting about our lives. It turned out she had been living in the area for a long time and was very involved in the community.

Over the next few weeks, she kept inviting me to different events and gatherings, which I appreciated but often couldn't attend due to work commitments. I was grateful for her efforts to include me, but I also felt a bit overwhelmed with the pressure to socialize when I was just trying to adjust to my new job and life.

One evening, she organized a small dinner party and insisted I come. I politely told her I was feeling a bit tired from work and would have to pass. She seemed upset and said I was missing out on a great opportunity to meet people. I tried to explain that I needed some time to myself to recharge, but she didn’t seem to understand.

The next day, I ran into her while taking out the trash. She brought up the dinner party again, expressing disappointment that I didn’t come and saying she was worried I was isolating myself. I felt bad, as I appreciated her concern, but I also felt my boundaries were not being respected. I told her I was grateful for the invite but that I needed to take things at my own pace.

Afterwards, I worried that I might have come off as rude or dismissive, but I genuinely needed to prioritize my mental health. I wanted her to know I appreciated her friendship, but also needed to handle my transition in my own way. 

So, am I the asshole for setting boundaries with my neighbor who was just trying to be friendly?",531,2637,0.94,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_93256,2020-01-03 00:00:00,NAH,1680,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"A few months ago, I was at a friend's birthday party, and it was a pretty lively gathering with people I knew and some I didn’t. There was this guy there, Jake, who was really outgoing and charming. He started chatting me up, and we hit it off. We ended up spending a lot of the night together, laughing and sharing stories.

As the night progressed, I noticed that Jake had a bit too much to drink. He started getting a little too loud and overly affectionate, which made me uncomfortable. At one point, he insisted on giving me a hug that felt more like a bear trap than a friendly embrace. I tried to gently pull away, but he held on tight like he didn’t want to let go.

I was feeling awkward and didn’t want to ruin the party, so I decided to take a break and stepped outside for some fresh air. Jake followed me out, still a little tipsy but trying to maintain his charm. He kept talking about how much fun he was having and how we should hang out again.

After a while, I told him I needed to go back inside. He seemed to take that as a sign to keep following me, and I could feel my discomfort growing. I tried to be polite and friendly, but he kept leaning in closer and making comments that felt a bit too personal for the situation.

Feeling overwhelmed, I decided it was time to leave the party. I told my friend, the birthday girl, that I was saying my goodbyes and headed for the door. As I was leaving, Jake caught up to me and asked if he could walk me to my car. I hesitated, knowing I didn’t want to prolong the interaction, but I didn’t want to be rude.

We walked outside, and I made small talk to keep things light. But once we reached my car, he leaned in and asked for my number. I felt cornered and didn’t know how to say no without hurting his feelings. I ended up giving him my number, thinking it might diffuse the situation.

After I got home, I felt uneasy about the whole encounter. I texted my friend and told her what happened. She appreciated my honesty and said she’d keep an eye on him in the future, as she hadn’t realized he was coming on so strong.

The following week, I received a text from Jake. He was sweet and sincere, asking if I wanted to hang out. I didn’t respond right away, feeling unsure about how to handle it. Eventually, I decided to politely decline, explaining that I wasn’t interested in pursuing anything further.

Jake didn’t take it well and sent a few messages expressing his disappointment. However, he eventually backed off and we both moved on. I felt relieved that I had set my boundaries, but I also felt bad about how the whole thing unfolded.

In the end, I think we both had our moments where we misunderstood the situation and overstepped a bit, but it wasn’t malicious. So, I’m wondering if I handled it right or if I could have approached it differently. What do you think?",486,2297,0.55,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_44313,2018-12-05 00:00:00,NAH,2845,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I recently started a new job, and I’ve been really excited about it. The team is great, and the work culture is generally positive. However, there’s one issue that’s been bothering me, and I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable or not, so I wanted to share my experience here.

During our lunch breaks, the team often goes out to eat together, which I think is a nice way to bond. Most of my coworkers are friendly, and I enjoy their company. However, there’s one coworker, let’s call her ""Sarah,"" who has been making some comments that make me uncomfortable.

Sarah has a good sense of humor, but sometimes her jokes go a bit too far. For example, she often makes fun of people’s eating habits or how much they eat, even if it’s all in good fun. I’ve seen her tease a couple of my coworkers about their meal choices, and while they seem to take it lightly, I can’t help but feel it’s not really appropriate. I’ve also noticed that sometimes her comments can come off as judgmental, even if she doesn’t intend them to be.

I wanted to address this with Sarah because I think it could create a more positive atmosphere for everyone. I’m considering bringing it up during our next lunch together, but I’m worried that it might come off the wrong way. I don’t want to create tension in the team or make her feel attacked. On the other hand, I think it’s important to foster an environment where everyone feels comfortable and respected.

So, I’m asking: Would I be the asshole if I brought this up with her? Or should I just let it be and hope it doesn’t escalate?

It’s a nice way for everyone to contribute and enjoy fresh produce. Recently, I noticed that one of my neighbors, who I’ll call Sarah, had been taking a lot of the tomatoes and cucumbers without asking. At first, I thought maybe she was just really hungry or had a big family to feed, so I didn’t say anything.

However, after a couple of weeks, it became clear that she was taking more than her fair share. I mentioned it casually to another neighbor, and they said they had noticed the same thing. We both agreed that it was starting to feel unfair since we all worked hard to grow those vegetables.

One day, I decided to bring it up with Sarah. I approached her while we were both at the garden and said something like, “Hey, I’ve noticed you’ve been taking a lot of the tomatoes lately. I just wanted to make sure we’re all sharing things equally.” She looked surprised and said she didn’t mean to overstep, but she did have a lot of kids at home and sometimes it felt like there wasn’t enough to go around.

I felt bad for bringing it up, but I thought it was important to address the issue. We ended up having a nice conversation, and Sarah apologized. She said she’d make a point to ask before taking anything in the future. I think we both learned something, and it felt good to resolve it without any hard feelings.

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been together for a few years, and while we share many interests, there's one thing we seem to disagree on: how long it takes to get ready in the morning. I tend to be someone who takes a while to prepare for my day. I like to have a decent routine—shower, breakfast, coffee, and some quiet time to mentally prepare. My partner, on the other hand, is much more of a ""get up and go"" type of person. They could get ready in 15 minutes if they wanted to, and they prefer to leave as early as possible to avoid traffic.

We've had some hiccups about this before, particularly on weekdays when we both need to be out the door at a certain time. I try to start getting ready earlier, but it doesn't always work out, and there have been days where my partner has gotten frustrated waiting for me. They’ve expressed that they feel stressed when we’re running late and that it impacts their day.

Recently, we had an important event to attend, and I knew that I needed to be ready on time. I woke up early, but I still ended up taking longer than I planned. My partner, who was ready and waiting, started to get visibly anxious and began pacing around the apartment. I could tell they were getting overwhelmed, so I tried to hurry up and finish my routine.

When I finally came out, my partner was upset and confronted me about my time management, saying they felt like I didn’t care about being on time. I got defensive, explaining that I had tried to start earlier but sometimes my routine takes longer than I expect. We ended up having a heated discussion, both of us feeling misunderstood.

Afterwards, I felt terrible. I never meant to make my partner worry or feel like I was disregarding their time. We eventually sat down and talked it through, both apologizing for how we’d handled the situation. We decided to work on a plan together—setting a time for when I should start getting ready and maybe even modifying my routine a bit to accommodate their preferences.

In the end, I don’t think either of us is an asshole; we just had a miscommunication and different styles of handling our mornings.

No one is the Asshole,"So I (22) recently started a new job, and I’m really excited about it. I’ve been working hard to make a good impression and build relationships with my coworkers. I’ve always believed in being supportive and fostering a positive work environment.

A couple of weeks ago, my coworker, Sam (30), was going through a tough time because his dog had to be put down. I could see he was struggling, and I wanted to help. I reached out to him and offered my condolences, and we ended up having a long conversation about it. I shared some of my own experiences with losing pets, which seemed to help him feel a bit better.

However, I noticed that some of the other coworkers were not very sympathetic to Sam's situation. They made comments that it was just a dog and suggested he should just get over it. I felt awful about that and decided to speak up. I told them that losing a pet is a significant loss for many people and that they should be more compassionate. 

After that, some coworkers approached me privately and said that I overstepped and should have just let them handle their own conversations. They felt that by defending Sam, I made them uncomfortable and created a divide in the team. I can understand their perspective, but I also feel strongly about supporting people in their moments of grief.

I've been in a committed relationship with my partner for about three years now. We both have full-time jobs, but I'm the primary breadwinner. My partner works part-time in a job that they enjoy but doesn't pay very well. I come from a family that values financial independence and hard work, while my partner's family has a more relaxed view on career pursuits—believing happiness is more important than financial stability.

Issue:

Recently, my partner expressed a desire to quit their part-time job and focus solely on a passion project they’ve been working on. I fully support their creativity, but I have concerns about the financial implications of this decision. I voiced my worries about how we would manage our bills and expenses if they stopped working altogether. In our discussions, I made it clear that I wanted them to feel fulfilled, but I also emphasized the importance of maintaining some source of income while pursuing their passion. I suggested maybe reducing their hours instead of quitting entirely.

My partner felt hurt by my response, thinking I was dismissing their dreams and not trusting their capabilities. I didn’t mean to come across that way; I genuinely want to support them, but I’m also worried about our financial situation. I’m now wondering if I was too harsh in my concerns.

When I arrived at the reception, I noticed that the seating arrangement had placed me at a table with a few acquaintances and one of my closest friends, Sarah. Sarah brought her boyfriend, who I hadn't met yet. As the night progressed, I was chatting with Sarah and her boyfriend, and we were all enjoying ourselves.

However, a couple of hours in, I noticed that one of the other tables was experiencing a bit of tension. It turned out that one of the guests, Mike, was sitting away from his date because of the seating arrangement, and he was visibly upset about it. I overheard him talking about how he really wanted to be near his date, but they had been seated at opposite ends of the reception.

I felt bad for him, but I wasn't sure what to do. I was enjoying my time at the table I was at. Eventually, Sarah and I ended up stepping away from the table for a moment to take some photos, and when we returned, I noticed Mike was still sulking. In that moment, I suggested to Sarah that we offer to switch tables with Mike and his date. I thought it could help alleviate the tension and let them enjoy the evening together.

Sarah hesitated because she was happy where we were sitting, and I didn’t want to make her uncomfortable, but I felt bad for Mike. I ultimately decided not to push it further, and we stayed at our table. I did feel a bit guilty for not taking action, but I also didn't want to ruin my night or Sarah’s.

In the end, I grabbed a drink and mingled with other guests, and I noticed Mike and his date were eventually able to sit together, which made me happy. I felt like I could have done more, but I also respected Sarah's feelings and our enjoyment of the evening.

No one is the Asshole,"So this happened a few months ago.

I have a close friend, let’s call him Mike. We’ve known each other for years and have always been able to talk about anything. Recently, he started dating someone new, who we’ll call Sarah. Sarah is really nice, but she has some pretty strong opinions about pets; she believes that no one should own animals because it’s better for them in the wild.

A couple of weeks into their relationship, Mike invited a few friends over for a game night, and I decided to bring my dog, Bella, with me. Bella is a sweet, well-behaved rescue who’s been a part of my life for years. I thought it would be fine since Mike had said he was okay with dogs, and I assumed Sarah would be too, given how friendly Bella is.

When I arrived, Sarah was there, and she seemed a bit taken aback when she saw Bella. As the night went on, she voiced her opinions about pet ownership multiple times, saying how sad it was for animals to be kept as pets. I tried to be respectful and not get into a debate, but I could tell Mike was uncomfortable. He loves animals but also understands the joys of having a pet.

At one point, Sarah made a remark about how people who own pets are selfish, and I felt a bit hurt. I knew my intentions were good and that Bella was part of my family. I decided to gently respond that pets can provide companionship and love, and that many of them thrive with human care. The conversation got a little tense, and Mike tried to change the topic, but it lingered in the air.

After the game night, Mike texted me to say he appreciated my perspective but was worried about how Sarah felt. He mentioned that he didn’t want to create friction between us and didn’t know how to approach the topic with her. I told him that I understood and that it’s important for him to communicate with her since they’re dating.

A few days later, Sarah texted me to apologize, saying she didn’t mean to offend anyone and that she was just passionate about her beliefs. I appreciated her reaching out, and we ended up having a good conversation about our different viewpoints.

In the end, I think we all learned something. It was awkward at times, but I really respect both Mike and Sarah for being open about their feelings. I still feel a bit bad for the tension, but I also believe it’s important to stand up for what you care about.

TL;DR: I brought my dog to a friend’s game night, and his girlfriend has strong opinions about pet ownership, which led to some tension. I expressed my views respectfully, and we ended up having a good conversation later. Am I the asshole for standing up for my pet when it created a little conflict?",446,1156,0.58,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_64020,2023-05-11 00:00:00,NAH,2654,AITA

One day, while we were having coffee, Maya opened up about how she felt unappreciated and unimportant to Jake. I could sense her pain, and I encouraged her to communicate her feelings to him, suggesting that perhaps they should consider couples therapy. She seemed hesitant but agreed that it could be a good idea.

A few weeks passed, and I learned that Maya and Jake had a big fight after she tried to bring up her concerns. It seems that Jake was quite defensive and didn’t respond well to her feelings. Maya was feeling really down, and I tried my best to support her. I reminded her that she deserves to be happy and encouraged her to take some time to reflect on what she truly wants.

Then, I made a mistake. I mentioned to Maya that I had seen Jake at a party with another woman. I didn’t mean for it to come across as gossip, but I thought it might help her see that she shouldn’t settle for less than she deserves. Maya was understandably upset but also expressed that she needed to confront Jake about it. 

After talking to him, Maya discovered that there had been nothing inappropriate between Jake and the woman I saw him with; they were just acquaintances. However, the confrontation led to a lot of tension between them, and now Maya feels conflicted about our friendship and whether I overstepped.

However, Mia has always been someone who is very particular about how she wants things, especially when it comes to her wedding plans.

A few weeks ago, she asked me to help with some wedding planning since I’ve been married for a few years now and have some experience. I was excited to help her out and we started discussing ideas. During the conversation, she expressed her desire to keep everything super traditional, which I completely understood since it's her big day.

However, I also shared some ideas that I thought could make the day more personal and fun, like including some non-traditional elements that reflect their personalities. Unfortunately, Mia took it as me trying to undermine her vision for the wedding. She got upset and said that I was making her feel like she couldn’t have the wedding she wanted. I tried to explain that I was just trying to help and that I thought a mix of traditional and personal could be nice, but she wouldn’t hear it.

Things escalated, and eventually, I suggested that maybe she should just stick to what she wants and not worry about what other people think. This made her even more upset, and she accused me of being unsupportive. I felt terrible because I was genuinely trying to be helpful, but now she’s not talking to me and I feel like I’ve ruined our relationship over this.

Now, I’m engaged too, and while I want her to be a part of my day, I’m also feeling the weight of the planning process. I have another close friend who is incredibly organized and has already been suggesting ideas that align perfectly with my vision. She’s great at budgeting and has offered to help with the DIY aspects of the wedding, which, to be honest, feels like a huge relief.

This trip was something we both looked forward to as a break from our hectic lives. 

A few weeks before the trip, my friend’s cousin, who she’s very close to, had a serious health scare, and she felt the need to support her cousin through this tough time. I completely understood and told her it was okay if she needed to cancel the trip. However, she insisted that her cousin would want her to go and have some fun too. 

As the trip approached, I noticed that my friend was more distracted and anxious about her cousin's situation. The night before we were supposed to leave, she called me in tears, saying she couldn’t go anymore because she felt guilty for wanting to enjoy herself while her cousin was struggling. 

I tried to reassure her that it was okay to take the trip and enjoy her time. I told her that her cousin would want her to have a good time and that she could still be there for her. However, she ultimately decided to stay back and support her cousin, which I respect but also left me feeling disappointed. 

I went on the trip by myself, and while I had a good time, it felt a bit lonely without her. I later told her that I wished she could have come along and that I felt sad about the change of plans.

She's a free-spirited artist, living in a vibrant, bustling city, while he's more of a quiet, introverted type who enjoys spending time in nature and prefers a simple, low-key life. They've been dating for a few months now, and while they seem happy together, I've noticed some tension developing between them.

Last weekend, my sister invited us over for dinner and asked if I could bring my new board game collection to play after the meal. I was excited, as I thought it would be a fun way for everyone to bond. When I arrived, I noticed her boyfriend looked visibly uncomfortable at the idea of playing a game, which made me feel a bit awkward. I tried to include him by suggesting we play a game that didn't require too much strategy, something light-hearted and fun.

However, he declined and said he’d rather go for a walk outside. I could see my sister felt a bit torn, wanting to spend time with him but also wanting to enjoy the game night she had planned. In the end, she decided to join him for the walk, which left me feeling a bit disappointed since I had brought the games specifically for that evening.

After they returned, I expressed how I felt a little sad we couldn't play together, and her boyfriend snapped at me, saying that not everyone enjoys board games and that I should be more considerate of different tastes. My sister quickly jumped in to calm the situation, but I felt bad for bringing it up and making things tense.

I agreed and we took our time, chatting and enjoying the views. However, I also noticed that because of her earlier fall, she was overly cautious and hesitant, which slowed us down quite a bit. 

At one point, I gently suggested that maybe we should turn back since the weather seemed to be getting worse and we didn’t want to risk anything. She was initially disappointed and said she wanted to keep going, but after a bit of back and forth and seeing the rain start to pick up, she finally agreed to head back. 

I felt bad for pushing her a bit, even though I wanted to make sure we stayed safe. Looking back, I wonder if I should have just let her dictate the pace entirely and not voiced my concerns as much. Did I make her feel like her anxiety was invalid?

No one is the Asshole,"M32 here, sharing a situation that unfolded recently with my partner ""Jamie"" (F30) and our families.

Jamie and I have been together for about four years, and we’ve created a great life together. We enjoy similar hobbies, have supportive families, and generally, things have been smooth sailing. However, there’s one sticking point: our families have very different views on some cultural matters.

Jamie comes from a traditional family that values certain customs and practices, while my family is more progressive and open-minded. Our families have met a few times, and while there’s been some awkwardness, everyone has tried to be respectful of each other's values.

Now, here’s the crux of the matter: recently, we celebrated our anniversary, and I thought it would be a good idea to combine our families for a dinner. Jamie was on board, but when I suggested it, my parents expressed discomfort with some of Jamie’s family traditions, which they find a bit outdated. Jamie overheard this and was understandably hurt. She felt that my parents were being dismissive of her culture.

After some back and forth, Jamie decided to speak up about how she felt. She expressed her desire for both families to respect each other’s backgrounds and traditions, emphasizing the importance of inclusivity. My parents apologized for coming off as judgmental and agreed to approach the dinner with an open mind.

In the end, we had a lovely dinner where both families shared stories and learned from each other. It was a bit tense at first, but by the end, everyone was laughing and enjoying the evening. Jamie and I were both proud of how our families handled the situation, and I felt grateful for her willingness to address the issue head-on.

I think we all learned something valuable about communication and respect for differing perspectives. No one was an outright ""asshole"" here; we were just navigating the complexities of blending two different cultural backgrounds. So, AITA for wanting to have both families together despite the initial discomfort?",513,563,0.55,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_94947,2019-02-19 00:00:00,NAH,2049,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, I have a friend who I've known for about 10 years, and we have a pretty close friendship. Recently, she invited me to her birthday party, which she wanted to celebrate at a fancy restaurant. I was excited and immediately said yes. However, about a week before the party, she posted a message in the group chat saying she had decided to make it a ""no gifts"" celebration because she just wanted everyone to enjoy the evening and not worry about presents.

I was a bit taken aback because I had already bought her a thoughtful gift that I was really excited to give her. It was something she had mentioned wanting for a while, and I spent a decent amount of money on it. When I saw her message about no gifts, I felt a little disappointed and unsure if I should still bring the gift or not.

On the day of the party, I decided to bring the gift anyway, just in case she changed her mind or wanted to accept it. I thought it would be a nice gesture, and I could always take it back if she insisted. When I arrived at the restaurant, she was genuinely happy to see me, and I handed her the gift, explaining that I understood her request but I really wanted to give it to her.

She smiled and accepted it, saying she appreciated the thought but reminded me that she wanted to keep things simple. I told her I completely understood and would respect that for future occasions. The party went wonderfully, and everyone had a great time.

Later, a couple of mutual friends mentioned that they thought I was kind of inconsiderate for bringing a gift after she specifically asked for none. I didn't intend to undermine her wishes, but I just wanted to celebrate her in a way I thought she would appreciate.

Am I the asshole for bringing a gift to a ""no gifts"" birthday party? I genuinely thought it was a thoughtful gesture, and I did respect her wishes to enjoy the evening without the pressure of gifts.",809,553,0.56,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_63524,2024-04-30 00:00:00,NAH,1899,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I hope this doesn’t come off as petty, but I wanted to get some outside perspective on a situation that happened recently. Here are the details:

* My sister and I have been very close growing up, and we both have a shared passion for cooking. We often exchange recipes and try out new dishes together.

* Recently, I discovered a fantastic recipe for a unique dish that I thought would impress her. I spent a lot of time perfecting it, and I was really excited to share it with her.

* When I finally had the chance to make it for a family gathering, I invited her to come over and try it. She was enthusiastic at first but later told me she was going to make the same dish to bring to the gathering, which I thought was a little odd since I had already prepped it.

* I expressed to her that I was a bit disappointed because I was looking forward to sharing my version, especially since I had worked hard on it. She felt that I was being possessive over the recipe and said that we should both make it and have a friendly competition to see whose version was better.

* I thought that was an interesting idea, but I still felt a bit hurt that she didn’t seem to respect my excitement over sharing something I created. In the end, we each made our versions and shared them at the gathering. Everyone enjoyed both, and it turned into a fun and lighthearted competition.

* However, I can't help but wonder if I came off as too sensitive or controlling by being upset in the first place. My sister thinks I overreacted, but I just wanted my moment to shine.

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been in a committed relationship for about two years now. We genuinely care for each other and have built a strong foundation of trust. Recently, however, we’ve encountered a bit of a hiccup due to my friendship with my neighbor, Sam.

Sam and I hit it off when I moved into the neighborhood a year ago. We often hang out, play video games, and go for walks with our dogs. Sam is great, and I appreciate the friendship we’ve developed. However, my partner has expressed some discomfort about how often I spend time with Sam, mainly because they don’t know him very well.

Last weekend, I invited Sam over for a movie night. It was just the two of us, and we ended up sitting on the couch, joking and having a good time. At no point did anything inappropriate happen—there was no flirting or anything that crossed a line; we were just two friends enjoying each other’s company. 

Later that night, when I told my partner how the night went, they seemed upset and said they felt uncomfortable with how close I was getting to Sam. I tried to reassure them that our friendship is platonic and that they have nothing to worry about. I also suggested that we invite Sam over for dinner so they could get to know him better.

My partner agreed to the dinner but still seemed uneasy about the situation. I understand where they’re coming from, as friendships can sometimes be confusing, but I also don’t want to feel restricted in my friendships. I genuinely want to maintain my friendship with Sam while also respecting my partner's feelings.

However, as parents, we’re worried about the safety of such a trip, especially given the recent surge in illnesses and our general concern for large gatherings. We sat down with him and explained our worries, and he was understandably upset. He felt like we were ruining his fun and not trusting him to take care of himself.

After some back and forth, we decided to let him present his arguments after dinner about why we should let him go. However, my husband and I made it clear that we were still leaning towards saying no. 

During dinner, our son’s frustration boiled over, and he accused us of being overprotective and not letting him have any independence. My husband tried to reassure him that our decision wasn’t personal, and that we just wanted what was best for him. 

In the end, we told him we’d think about it and discuss it again the next day. Both my husband and I felt that we weren’t being unreasonable, but we also didn’t want to completely dismiss his feelings.

Last week, we were hanging out when my friend started talking about a concert for that genre coming up in our city. He was really excited and asked if I wanted to go with him. I hesitated, knowing that I wouldn’t enjoy it and that I might just end up being a downer during the experience. I told him honestly that I appreciate his enthusiasm but that I wasn’t really into that kind of music and wouldn’t enjoy the concert.

He seemed a bit hurt and said that he was looking forward to experiencing it together, but I suggested that he could invite someone else who shares his interest more. He agreed but still seemed disappointed. I felt bad for not wanting to support him, but I also didn’t want to pretend to enjoy something that I genuinely wouldn’t.

No one is the Asshole,"A little backstory: my sister and I have always been close, but we’ve had our fair share of disagreements over the years. Recently, she got engaged and started planning her wedding. I was thrilled for her and wanted to be supportive. However, when she asked me to be her maid of honor, I was both excited and a little nervous because I knew it would come with a lot of responsibilities.

As the planning progressed, my sister had some specific ideas about the wedding that I didn’t quite agree with. For example, she wanted a very extravagant wedding with a large guest list, which would mean a huge budget and a lot of stress. I tried to share my thoughts gently, suggesting that a more intimate ceremony might be less overwhelming for her. She seemed to take my suggestions as criticism, and our conversations often turned into heated debates.

Then came the bridal shower planning. My sister wanted to invite a huge number of people, but I felt it would be more manageable and meaningful to keep it smaller. I suggested we go for a cozy gathering with close friends and family instead of a grand event. This led to another argument, and I felt like I was walking on eggshells trying to help her while also voicing my opinions.

Eventually, I decided to step back a little. I told her that I wanted her to have the wedding of her dreams and that I would support her no matter what, but I felt like the planning was becoming too stressful for both of us. I wanted her to be happy, and I didn’t want to compromise our relationship over wedding details.

My sister was hurt by my decision to take a step back and felt I was abandoning her during a crucial time. We’ve since had some space, and I think it’s helped us both reflect on the situation.

So, am I the asshole for stepping back from wedding planning because it was causing tension between my sister and me?

However, on the day of the wedding, I started feeling unwell with a bad cold. I debated whether to go, but I didn’t want to miss it, especially since I was part of the wedding party.

I made the decision to attend, but I was careful to maintain some distance from other guests to avoid spreading my germs. During the reception, I was sitting at a table with a few friends, and we were all having a great time despite my sniffles.

At one point, I got up to use the restroom, and on my way back, I overheard a couple of guests at another table discussing how I should have stayed home because I was clearly sick. I felt embarrassed and a bit hurt because I was doing my best to enjoy the day without affecting others. 

I decided to address it by calmly approaching them and explaining that I took precautions and was still really excited to celebrate with everyone. They acknowledged my effort but still insisted that I shouldn’t have come at all. In the end, I walked away feeling a mix of emotions but mostly just wanting to enjoy the rest of the wedding.

I understand their concern, but I also believe that I tried my best to respect the situation.

I listened to him and expressed my concern about the potential consequences, but I also made it clear that he could talk to me about it without judgment.

A couple of days later, he called me during lunch, and I could tell he was upset. He ended up skipping school that day, and when I asked him how it went, he confessed that it was a terrible idea. He was feeling guilty about lying to our parents and stressed about falling behind in his classes.

I told him that while I was disappointed he skipped school, I appreciated him being honest with me about it. I offered to help him catch up on his homework and even suggested we organize a weekend study session to get him back on track. I also encouraged him to come clean to our parents about what happened, emphasizing that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s important to own up to them.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently found myself in a bit of a situation with my sister and her wedding plans. She’s getting married in a year and has been planning everything down to the smallest detail. I’ve been supportive, but she’s particularly fixated on having a very specific theme that involves a lot of DIY projects, which she wants family members to help with.

My sister asked me to take on the role of her wedding planner, but I’ve got a demanding job that requires me to travel frequently, and I just don’t have the time or energy to commit to such a big task. I gently explained my concerns to her, emphasizing that I want to be there for her but can’t stretch myself too thin.

After that conversation, my sister seemed a bit hurt but understood. However, she later asked me to help her with a few specific aspects of the planning when I’m available. I agreed to assist with those, but I made it clear that I wouldn’t be able to take on more responsibility.

Then a few weeks ago, she found out that a close friend of hers, who initially offered to help with the planning, had to back out due to personal reasons. My sister was understandably stressed and asked if I could step in more fully for a couple of months leading up to the wedding. Again, I expressed my limitations and said I could help, but not at the level she needed. 

Our conversation ended up becoming quite emotional, with my sister expressing her frustration at feeling like she was going through this alone and that I didn’t care enough to step up. I was taken aback because I do care, but I simply can’t manage that level of commitment.

One day, she reached out and asked if I could come over to hang out because she was feeling really low and didn’t want to be alone. I dropped everything and went to her place, thinking we could watch some movies and maybe have a heart-to-heart talk.

When I got there, Mia seemed a bit off. She was quiet and distant, not the usual Mia I knew. I tried to engage her by suggesting a couple of movies we could watch, but she just shrugged and said she didn’t really feel like doing anything. I could sense she was overwhelmed, so I decided to just sit with her and let her talk if she wanted to. After a while of silence, I asked her how she felt about talking to a therapist or trying some new coping strategies. 

Mia got upset and said she didn’t want to talk about that right now; she just wanted me to be there for her without trying to fix anything. I felt a bit hurt because my intentions were good, and I thought I was helping by bringing up something that could benefit her. I tried to explain that I just wanted the best for her, but she got more frustrated and told me I was being too pushy.

I explained to him that while it's great to appreciate nature, it's important to let the ladybug go back to its home so it can continue to live freely. He was disappointed but understood.

Later, while we were having a picnic, I noticed another child, about his age, trying to catch insects to keep in a jar. My son watched for a while and then expressed a desire to join in.

No one is the Asshole,"I [38M] recently had a situation with my older brother [40M] and his wife [39F] that I’ve been thinking a lot about. They have a son, Jake [8M], who is a really sweet kid. My brother has always been the more serious one in our family, while I tend to be more laid-back and fun-loving, which sometimes leads to differing parenting styles.

A couple of weekends ago, my brother and his wife asked me to watch Jake while they went out for a date night. I was happy to help and planned a fun night with him, including making homemade pizza and watching movies. Jake loves superheroes, so I even planned to let him dress up in his Spider-Man costume.

While we were having fun, I decided to play a little prank on him. I told him that I was going to ""turn him into a real superhero"" with a special potion. I mixed up some soda and a little bit of food coloring and told him it was my secret superhero serum. He was excited and pretended to drink it, giggling along with me. 

When my brother and his wife returned, everything was fine until they saw the kitchen in a bit of a mess from our cooking adventure and the remnants of our “potion” on the table. My brother looked furious and immediately started lecturing me about how I shouldn’t be playing pranks on Jake because it could confuse him, and he doesn’t want him to think that making a mess is okay or that it’s funny to trick people. I understood his concerns but felt like he overreacted a bit.

I apologized sincerely for not considering how he might interpret the prank and promised to be more mindful in the future. However, I also felt that I was just trying to have fun and create a memorable experience with my nephew.

I’ve been wondering if I overstepped my bounds or if my brother was too hard on me. I really value my relationship with him and want to respect his parenting style, but I also think a little fun and light-heartedness can be good for kids. 

WIBTA if I continued to play light-hearted pranks with Jake in the future? I just want to know if I’m in the wrong for wanting to bring a little fun into our time together.",576,765,0.99,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_30044,2018-10-03 00:00:00,NAH,2093,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Growing up, my best friend Mia and I shared everything, from our dreams to our secrets. We even promised each other we would both be there for each other’s first big milestones in life, like getting engaged and married. Fast forward to now, and I recently got engaged. I was over the moon and couldn’t wait to share the news with Mia.

However, when it came to planning my wedding, I found myself in a bit of a dilemma. Mia has always been a free spirit—she's creative and spontaneous, but not the greatest when it comes to organization or time management. I absolutely love her personality, but I know that her unpredictability might create some challenges as she takes on the role of maid of honor.

I also have another close friend, Sarah, who is incredibly organized and has a knack for planning. She’s already been offering help, sending me ideas for decorations and timelines that fit my vision perfectly. The thought of having Sarah as my maid of honor feels right because I know she would handle everything with grace and ensure that the day goes smoothly.

But here’s the catch: Mia has been looking forward to the role of maid of honor for as long as I can remember, and I don’t want to hurt her feelings. I can see how much she cares about being involved in my wedding, and it breaks my heart to think of disappointing her.

I’m torn between asking Sarah to be my maid of honor—where I know things will be more organized and less stressful—and sticking to our childhood promise with Mia, which could lead to chaos on the big day.

So, I’m wondering, would I be the asshole if I decided to ask Sarah to be my maid of honor instead of Mia? 

Tl;dr: I want to ask my organized friend to be my maid of honor instead of my best friend, who has always wanted that role, fearing it might hurt her feelings.",516,917,0.73,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_37142,2018-03-10 00:00:00,NAH,1810,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"For context, I'm a 28-year-old female who has been living with my partner for the past three years. We have a pretty solid and supportive relationship, but we come from different backgrounds when it comes to finances. My partner grew up in a household where money was tight, while my family had a more comfortable financial situation, which has shaped our respective views on saving and spending.

Recently, my partner started a new job, and while their salary is decent, they have been really stressed about budgeting and saving for future expenses, especially since they want to buy a house in a couple of years. I completely understand their concerns, as homeownership is a significant investment.

Last week, I decided to surprise my partner with a weekend getaway to celebrate their new job. I found a nice cabin in the woods and thought it would be a great way for us to unwind and enjoy each other's company. I paid for the entire trip out of my savings, thinking it would just be a nice treat. When I told my partner about the trip, they seemed less excited than I had hoped. They expressed concern about the expense, saying that we should be saving more money right now instead of spending it on a getaway.

I felt a bit hurt because my intention was to create a happy memory together, but I also understood where they were coming from. We ended up discussing it further, and I explained that I wanted to treat them because I felt they deserved a break after all the stress they’ve been under. My partner acknowledged that my intentions were good but still felt uncomfortable with the expense.

In the end, we decided to go on the trip but agreed to keep a closer eye on our finances moving forward. I don’t believe either of us was in the wrong; we just have different priorities and perspectives when it comes to spending.

I'm in a bit of a complicated situation with my cousin, and I wanted to share to see if I'm in the wrong. 

So, a few weeks ago, my cousin reached out to me to ask if I would be interested in helping her with her wedding planning. She's getting married next spring, and I know she's been feeling overwhelmed. I love her and want to support her, but I also have a pretty hectic schedule right now with work and personal commitments.

When she asked, I expressed my concerns about my availability, but I offered to help where I could—like brainstorming ideas or maybe attending a couple of meetings when I could fit them in. However, she seemed disappointed and said she really needed someone to be more involved, like a co-planner.

I understand that weddings can be stressful and that she’s under a lot of pressure to make everything perfect, but I just don’t have the capacity to take on such a big role. I suggested that she might consider hiring a wedding planner or asking other friends for help. She got upset and said she thought we were closer than that and that I didn’t care enough to make time for her.

I feel bad because I do care about her and want to be supportive, but I also believe it's important to set boundaries and not overcommit. I don’t want to let her down, but I also need to take care of myself.

This year, she decided to apply to a few colleges, and the pressure has been intense for her. I've always done my best to support her, helping her with her applications and encouraging her to take breaks and practice self-care.

Recently, our parents decided to host a family dinner to celebrate my sister finishing her applications. They invited our extended family, which includes our very competitive cousins who are already in college. During the dinner, my cousins started sharing stories about their college experiences and the rigorous admissions processes they faced. While I know they meant well, my sister seemed to shrink in her seat as they talked about their accolades and the pressure they felt to succeed.

After the dinner, I saw my sister visibly upset. I tried to comfort her, but she expressed that she felt inadequate compared to our cousins. I knew that my cousins didn't intend to hurt her feelings, but I also felt that their comments were insensitive, given my sister's struggles.

The next day, I reached out to my cousins in a private message. I thanked them for coming to the dinner and mentioned how much I appreciated their support for my sister. However, I also gently reminded them that not everyone is in the same place in their academic journey, and it might be better to keep the conversation a bit more low-key around her next time. I wanted them to be aware of her feelings without coming across as accusatory or harsh.

They responded positively, saying they hadn’t realized the impact their words had on her and that they would be more mindful in the future.

At one point, he ran straight toward the table where the desserts were set up. I called out, “Hey! Be careful!” because I was worried he might accidentally knock something over. The boy stopped short, looked at me, and then continued playing. His mom, who was chatting with some friends nearby, overheard and came over. She looked a bit annoyed and said, “He’s just having fun, no need to yell at him.”

I immediately felt bad and told her I was just trying to keep the desserts safe. She softened a bit and said, “I appreciate that, but you don’t have to worry so much. Kids need to play.” I agreed and apologized for any misunderstanding.

The event went well, and later on, the mom and I ended up chatting while the kids played. We even laughed about how protective we can be over food at events.

I brought this up to my partner and suggested we could reschedule our hike for the next weekend. My partner was disappointed but understood where I was coming from.

No one is the Asshole,"Backstory: I (28F) have a younger sister (24F) who recently got engaged. She and her fiancé are planning a big wedding for next summer. Since I'm really close with her, I've been helping her with the planning and offered to assist with various tasks, like designing invitations and organizing the guest list.

A few weeks ago, my sister asked me if I could help her with a specific task: she wanted to create a video montage of memories with family and friends to show during the reception. I thought it was a lovely idea, and I enthusiastically agreed to help her with it.

As I started working on the montage, I reached out to family members and friends to gather photos and videos. One of our cousins (25M) sent over a lot of great content, but as I was putting everything together, I noticed that a few of his photos included my sister’s ex-boyfriend. While they had been together for several years, they broke up amicably a couple of years ago, and my sister is now happily engaged. 

When I showed my sister the montage, I included the photos but mentioned that I could remove the ones with her ex if she wanted. She paused for a moment before saying she didn’t mind including them; they were part of her life and memories, after all. However, I felt uneasy about it and worried that it might make her soon-to-be husband uncomfortable if he saw them during the wedding.

So, I ended up deciding to take out the photos of her ex without telling her and replaced them with other pictures. When I showed her the updated version, she was upset and felt that I had overstepped by making that decision for her. She said it was her montage and she wanted to reflect her entire journey, including her past relationships.

I feel bad for disregarding her wishes, but I truly thought it was for the best since I wanted to avoid any potential awkwardness at the wedding.

A few weeks ago, I hosted a small gathering for some friends at my house. I put a lot of effort into planning the evening, including cooking a nice dinner and setting up some games. Overall, it went well, and everyone seemed to have a good time.

However, one of my friends, let’s call him Mark, got a bit too rowdy with the games and ended up accidentally breaking a decorative vase that had sentimental value to me.

Mark immediately apologized and offered to replace it, but I told him it was okay, accidents happen, and I didn’t want to ruin the night.

I decided to bring it up with Mark in a friendly way, not wanting to come across as confrontational. I mentioned that while I appreciated his offer, it would be nice if he could help me look for a similar vase or chip in a bit for its replacement.

Mark seemed taken aback and said he felt awful and didn’t want to feel pressured about it. I reassured him that I didn’t mean to make him feel uncomfortable, but that I thought it was fair since it was damaged during our get-together.

My friend Emily (26) and I (27) have been close since college. Emily is an amazing person, but she has a habit of not following through on plans, which can be frustrating. She’s also been dealing with some personal issues lately, and I really wanted to support her.

We had made plans to go out for dinner one Friday night. I was looking forward to it, and I even made reservations at a nice restaurant. I texted her that morning to confirm, and she said she was excited. But as the day went on, I didn’t hear from her. I tried calling, but she didn’t pick up, and I was starting to worry. 

About an hour before our dinner reservation, she finally texted me saying she had a rough day and didn’t think she could make it. I was disappointed but totally understood that she needed some time. However, I didn’t want to waste the reservation, so I decided to go to the restaurant myself. I figured I could treat myself to a nice meal and maybe even enjoy some alone time.

When I got to the restaurant, I noticed that it was pretty empty, and I ended up sitting at a small table near the window. As I was looking through the menu, I spotted Emily walking by outside. I thought it was a coincidence, but then she came in and looked surprised to see me there. She approached my table and looked upset.

I told her I understood why she didn’t want to come, but I didn’t want to waste the reservation. She then revealed that she had had a meltdown at work and had been planning to go home and cry. Seeing me out made her feel worse, like she had let me down. I felt terrible, and we ended up talking about everything for a while. Eventually, I invited her to join me for dinner, and she agreed.

Everyone thought it was a great idea, so we made a jar out of an empty pizza box and started writing our notes. Throughout the night, Alex seemed to enjoy the idea and was smiling as we filled the jar.

However, towards the end of the night, Alex mentioned that he was feeling stressed about finances and asked if anyone had any tips for budgeting or finding a new job. I shared my experience of using a website to find freelancing gigs and suggested he could try it, too. But then, jokingly, I said, “Or you could always just win the lottery!” 

Alex took it the wrong way, though, and snapped back, “Not everyone can just win the lottery, you know!” Everyone went quiet, and it felt awkward for a moment. I quickly apologized, realizing my comment didn’t land well and wasn’t sensitive to his situation.

I made sure to keep a safe distance and often asked if they were comfortable. A few other friends were also concerned about this, leading to an awkward atmosphere.

Eventually, Alex ended up feeling worse and left early, which made me feel bad. I later texted them to check in and apologized for the tension that arose. They appreciated my concern but felt I had overstepped by trying to dictate their participation.

In hindsight, I see that both of us were coming from a place of care: I wanted to prioritize everyone's health, while Alex wanted to be included. Did I handle it poorly by suggesting they not attend, or was I right to be cautious?",657,1420,0.82,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_72065,2024-07-22 00:00:00,NAH,1754,AITA

They all get along really well, and honestly, I think Lisa is great, but sometimes it feels like she tries a little too hard to bond with me.

Recently, every time I see Lisa, she insists on giving me some advice about school and my future. I appreciate that she cares, but I feel overwhelmed because I’m already facing pressure from my mom and teachers. Last week, while we were all hanging out in the living room, she started talking about college applications and what I should do to prepare. I was polite and nodded along, but inside, I just wanted to switch the topic to something lighter.

I mentioned to my mom afterward that I felt uncomfortable with Lisa's constant advice-giving. My mom said Lisa means well and just wants to help, but I think it would be better if she let me navigate my own path without adding more pressure.

So now, I'm wondering if it would be rude to talk to Lisa directly about how I feel. I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I also want some space to figure things out on my own.

No one is the Asshole,"I (28M) have a younger brother, Jake (24M), who has always been a bit of a free spirit. He’s passionate about music and has been chasing his dream of becoming a musician for several years now. I’ve always supported him, but I also have a more traditional job and responsibilities, including a mortgage and bills to pay.

Recently, Jake was invited to perform at a local music festival, which was a huge opportunity for him. He was ecstatic and asked if I could help him out with some money for travel and accommodation since he didn’t have funds saved up. I thought about it for a while, but I decided that I couldn’t help him financially due to my own budget constraints. I encouraged him to seek sponsorship or find ways to fund it himself, which is what I had to do when I was in my early twenties.

Jake was disappointed but understood. The day before the festival, he called me to tell me that he wasn’t going to perform because he couldn’t afford to get there. I felt terrible for him but reiterated my stance on not being able to help. He got upset and accused me of not believing in him or supporting his dreams. I tried to explain that it wasn’t about belief but about my financial situation.

Fast forward to the festival day, and I decided to go and support him from the crowd. I thought it would be a great way to show him I still cared, even if I couldn’t help financially. When I arrived, I was shocked to see him on stage! It turned out that a friend of his had funded his travel last minute, and he was performing after all. 

I cheered him on, and after his performance, he ran off stage, beaming with excitement. However, when I congratulated him, he pulled me aside and said, “I can’t believe you didn’t help me out. You don’t really care, do you?” It took me by surprise, and I told him that I was proud of him for making it happen on his own and that I was there to support him. 

He seemed to dismiss my support and accused me of being a bad brother for not stepping up when he needed me. I felt hurt and frustrated. I told him I was there for him and that he should appreciate the support he had, even if it wasn’t financial.

Now, he’s been distant with me since that day, and I feel conflicted. I want to be there for him, but I also believe I did the right thing by encouraging him to find his own way. I’m just not sure if I was too harsh with him or if he is being unreasonable. 

So, was I the asshole for not giving him money and for my reaction when he confronted me?",492,1732,0.94,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_81328,2022-04-07 00:00:00,NAH,2498,AITA

I was really excited about it and wanted everything to be perfect. I spent a lot of time planning the menu and even tried a couple of new recipes, including a vegetarian dish since one of our friends is vegetarian.

The day of the party, I had a bit of a cold but didn’t want to let it ruin the night, so I pushed through and finished cooking. My partner, however, was feeling overwhelmed with the idea of hosting, especially when it came to cleaning up our place. We both agreed to split the responsibilities, but I noticed that they were getting more and more stressed as the evening approached.

When our friends arrived, I was juggling between serving food and chatting with everyone, and my partner was still trying to tidy up. At one point, I saw them struggling to keep up with the cleaning while I was busy in the kitchen. I thought it would be helpful to step in and take over the cleaning while they joined us for the dinner and enjoyed the company. I told them to relax and let me handle it, but they snapped at me, saying they could manage it themselves and that I should focus on the food.

I felt hurt because I was just trying to help, and it turned into a bit of a tension-filled moment. Our friends noticed the weird vibe and tried to lighten the mood, but I could tell my partner was upset. After our friends left, we ended up having a heart-to-heart conversation. I explained that I thought I was being helpful, and they expressed that they felt overwhelmed and didn’t want to feel like they were being sidelined in their own home.

In the end, we both apologized for how we handled the situation. I realized that while my intention was to help, I need to communicate better and check in with my partner instead of assuming what they needed. It was a learning experience for both of us, and we ended up feeling closer after discussing it.

No one is the Asshole,"I’m in my late 20s and recently ended a long-term relationship. My ex and I had been together for nearly seven years, and while we shared some incredible memories, we realized that we had grown apart and our futures were heading in different directions. It was a mutual decision, and we both agreed to remain friends if possible.

After the breakup, I felt a bit lost, but I took it as an opportunity to focus on myself and explore new hobbies. I started a painting class and joined a local hiking group, which has really helped me find joy in new experiences. I’ve also been spending more time with my friends and family, who have all been very supportive.

However, there’s a bit of a complication. My ex and I have a mutual friend group, and while we’ve both agreed to be civil, it’s been a little awkward at times. Recently, a few friends suggested we all go on a weekend trip together, and while I was initially excited, I realized that I’m not sure how to navigate the situation. I don’t want to make things uncomfortable for anyone, especially since I know my ex might still have feelings about the breakup.

I’ve talked to my ex about it, and they mentioned they’re fine with whatever I choose. They even suggested that we could both invite someone else along to ease the tension. But I’m worried that might complicate things even more. I want to be supportive and maintain my friendships, but I also don’t want to put myself in an uncomfortable position.

I wanted to make it special, so I prepared a three-course meal and even baked a cake from scratch. I sent out invitations and made sure to ask about any dietary restrictions.

One of my friends, who is vegetarian, mentioned that she really loves lasagna. Since I wanted everyone to enjoy the meal, I decided to make a vegetarian lasagna, along with a meat-based one for everyone else. I spent a good part of the day cooking and was excited to share the food with my friends.

When everyone arrived, we had a great time catching up and enjoying the food. However, my vegetarian friend was visibly upset when she saw that I had also prepared a meat lasagna. I asked her what was wrong, and she expressed that she felt uncomfortable being around the meat dish, even if it was on a separate table. I assured her that I made the vegetarian lasagna just for her, but she still felt uneasy.

In the end, I offered to wrap up the meat lasagna and put it away so she could enjoy the evening without feeling uncomfortable. She appreciated the gesture, but I still felt bad that I had unintentionally made her feel that way in the first place.

After the dinner, I reflected on it and wondered if I should have just opted for a completely vegetarian meal instead.

I (30F) have a younger brother (26M) who recently got engaged. The whole family is really excited for him and his fiancée, but it's been a bit complicated. 

My brother was always the one to follow the traditional route in life, and their engagement was no different. They immediately started planning a big wedding, and my parents are helping with the expenses. However, I have been feeling a bit left out of the process. I’m not one to make a fuss, but I was hoping to be more involved in the planning since I’ve always been close with my brother.

One day, during a family dinner, I casually mentioned that I would love to help with the wedding planning, even just by offering ideas or support. My brother brushed it off and said they had everything under control, which left me feeling a bit hurt. The next day, I sent him a message suggesting a few ideas I had for the wedding, thinking he might appreciate the input. Instead, he replied saying he felt I was overstepping and that they wanted to keep things simple without outside opinions.

I was taken aback and spent a few days feeling rejected and upset, which led me to vent to my close friends. They suggested I talk to him about how I felt. When I did, I approached it in a calm manner, explaining that I didn’t mean to intrude and just wanted to feel included since family means a lot to me. He apologized for being dismissive and admitted he was stressed about the wedding planning and didn’t mean to hurt my feelings. 

We ended up having a good conversation about how to balance things and he invited me to join a few planning sessions. We both left the conversation feeling better and I think it brought us closer.

I kept the guest list limited to around ten people to ensure we could have a good time without feeling crowded. My friends and I enjoy spending time together, and I wanted to create a fun and relaxed atmosphere. 

A few days before the party, I noticed that one of my friends, Sarah (28F), seemed a bit down during our group chats. I reached out to her to check in, and she mentioned that she had been feeling overwhelmed with work and personal issues lately. I wanted to include her in the festivities, so I invited her to come to the party.

The day of the party arrived, and everything was going smoothly. We had food, drinks, and games planned. As the night progressed, I noticed that Sarah was sitting quietly in the corner, not really engaging with anyone. I tried to include her in conversations and encouraged her to join in the games, but she seemed unresponsive. 

At one point, I asked her if everything was okay, and she opened up about feeling stressed and disconnected. I appreciated her honesty and wanted to support her, so I suggested we step outside for a bit to talk privately. We spent some time discussing what she was going through, and I reminded her that it was perfectly fine to take time for herself if she needed it.

They didn’t mean any harm, but I could tell they were frustrated and thought I was being a bad host.

I offered suggestions on how we could retrieve it, and after some brainstorming, we decided to use my shoelaces to try and fish it out. It took some effort, but we eventually managed to get it out of the water, though it was wet and unresponsive.

We both felt a mix of relief and disappointment. I suggested that we could try to dry it out when we got home, and she said she appreciated my help. However, as we continued our hike, I could tell she was still pretty upset about the whole situation. I tried to lighten the mood by joking about how I was now her official phone rescuer, but she didn’t find it funny.

Later, as we sat down for our picnic, she opened up about how stressed she felt about losing her phone and all that it contained. I listened and offered my support, but I also expressed that I thought it was important to be careful with our belongings, especially in nature. I didn’t mean to come off as insensitive, but I wanted her to understand that accidents happen and we can learn from them.

She took it the wrong way and said I was being dismissive of her feelings. I didn’t mean to upset her, and I ended up apologizing for my choice of words. We both agreed that it was a frustrating situation, and while we both felt a bit off for the rest of the day, we managed to enjoy the rest of our hike and the beautiful scenery.

A few days before the trip, my partner mentioned that their best friend, who is going through a rough patch, expressed a desire to join us. At first, I was a bit hesitant because I thought this was supposed to be our couple's getaway and I wasn’t sure if having a third person would change the dynamic. However, I also felt bad for their friend, who has been feeling lonely and down lately.

I voiced my concerns to my partner, explaining that I was worried about losing the intimacy of our trip and that I wanted to spend quality time together without distractions. My partner understood where I was coming from but insisted that it would be nice to have their friend along and that it could be a good way for them to cheer up.

In the end, we compromised. We invited the friend but planned some activities that would give my partner and me private time, like hiking alone together while the friend explored other areas. I felt relieved that we found a way to make everyone happy.

No one is the Asshole,"I (27F) have a close friend, Jenna (26F), who has been working really hard on her art portfolio to apply for a prestigious art program. She’s been struggling with self-doubt and anxiety about her work, and I’ve tried to support her as much as I can. For the past few weeks, I’ve been encouraging her to showcase her pieces and even offered to help her set up a small exhibition in my apartment so she could get feedback and feel more confident.

Last weekend, we finally set up the exhibition, and I invited a few mutual friends over to check it out. Jenna was nervous but excited. However, when our friends arrived, one of them, Mark (28M), who has a very strong opinion about art, ended up making some harsh comments about her work. He didn’t mean to be hurtful, but he’s very blunt, and it really seemed to affect Jenna. She became visibly upset and went to the bathroom to calm down.

I talked to Mark afterward and asked him to be more mindful of his words, especially considering that Jenna was in a vulnerable place. He argued that he was just being honest, and that’s how art critique works. I understood where he was coming from but felt that the timing and delivery could have been better. When Jenna came back, she could tell something was off, and I decided to defend her by telling Mark to lighten up and that everyone should be more supportive of her efforts.

After our friends left, Jenna expressed her gratitude for standing up for her. However, I felt a bit guilty because I didn’t want to create tension among our friend group, and Mark was clearly upset with me for confronting him. He later texted me saying he felt attacked and that it was unfair for me to put him on the spot like that.

I understand that Mark was trying to provide feedback, but I also think it’s important to be sensitive to people’s feelings, especially when they’re sharing something personal. Am I the asshole for standing up for Jenna and telling Mark to be more considerate, or could I have handled it differently?

Recently, I’ve been dealing with some personal issues, including anxiety and stress that stem from work and some family matters. I’ve tried to manage it on my own, but I reached a point where I felt burnt out and needed to take a step back for my mental well-being.

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for about a year. He’s wonderful and supportive, but he’s also very social and loves to go out and have fun with friends. Lately, I’ve been cancelling on plans because I just don’t have the energy to socialize. I’ve tried to explain to him that I’m going through a tough time and need some space to focus on myself, but he seems to take it personally.

The other day, I finally broke down and told him that I needed a little break from our relationship. I explained that it wasn’t about him, but rather about my need to prioritize my mental health right now. He was visibly upset and said he didn’t understand why I couldn’t rely on him for support instead of pushing him away. I reassured him that I care about him deeply and want to be with him, but I just need this time to recharge.

So, here’s the situation. My partner and I have been together for a couple of years, and we have a good relationship. However, we have very different views on how to spend our weekends. My partner is very outgoing and loves to socialize. He’s constantly suggesting we go out with friends or attend social events, especially on weekends. 

I, on the other hand, have always valued my alone time. I find it really refreshing to spend my weekends recharging, whether that means binge-watching shows, reading, or just enjoying some quiet time at home. I do enjoy socializing, but I often feel drained after a long week, and I need those weekends to recuperate.

Recently, he got upset with me because I declined an invitation to a big gathering with his friends. I explained that I just wanted to spend some time alone and that I didn’t want to feel obligated to be social when I was feeling worn out. He took it personally and said I was being selfish for not wanting to join in on the fun and that it seemed like I didn't care about his social life.

I tried to reassure him that I do care about his friends and I enjoy hanging out with them occasionally, but I simply prefer to keep my weekends low-key. It’s not that I don’t love him or appreciate his need for social interaction; it’s just that I feel like I need to prioritize my own well-being too.

Recently, our grandmother passed away, and it hit our family hard. She was a wonderful woman, and the loss was felt deeply by everyone. My sister and I both wanted to honor her memory, so we agreed to collaborate on a memorial service that would reflect our grandmother's vibrant spirit.

As we started planning, I suggested that we include some traditional elements that our grandmother loved, like specific songs and readings. My sister, however, wanted to make it more of a celebration of life with games and a more casual vibe. After some back and forth, we decided to incorporate both ideas. I would handle the more traditional aspects, while she would manage the celebratory elements.

The day of the service arrived, and I could see my sister was a bit stressed. I offered to help her with setting up and calming her down. During the service, things went smoothly until we got to the part where we were supposed to share memories. I noticed my sister getting emotional, and I gently encouraged her to speak first. Once she started sharing her memories, it became clear how much our grandmother meant to her, and it was beautiful to see her open up.

After the service, I told her how proud I was of her for sharing such heartfelt memories, and she thanked me for being supportive. We ended up having a good conversation about our grandmother and shared a few laughs. It felt like a turning point in our relationship.

After dinner, I offered dessert, which included a cake that I had baked with eggs and dairy. Jamie declined, stating she didn’t eat anything that wasn’t vegan. I felt a bit awkward, but I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it, so I just said, “I’m sorry, I didn’t know you were vegan. I’ll make sure to have something for you next time.”

Later that night, on our group chat, Jamie expressed that she felt excluded during the dinner and suggested that next time, I should consider preparing a vegan option to accommodate all guests.

I’m 24 and recently graduated from university. I’ve been working at a marketing firm for the past few months and things are going well. My best friend, “L,” has been struggling a bit since graduating a year ago. She studied graphic design but has had a hard time landing a job in her field. 

L has been working at a coffee shop to make ends meet, but she’s been feeling discouraged and frustrated. She often talks about how she feels stuck and that she really wants to get back into design. I’ve been trying to support her through this difficult time, encouraging her to keep applying for jobs and reminding her of her talent.

Recently, I received a small bonus at work, about $1,500, and I decided to offer L a way to get her portfolio professionally printed and get a subscription to a design software she needs for applications. It’s something she mentioned wanting to do, but just didn’t have the funds for right now. 

When I offered to send her the money, she was taken aback. She told me it was too generous and that she didn’t want to feel like I was pitying her. I reassured her that it wasn’t about pity; I just wanted to help her get back on her feet. I emphasized that I believed in her and wanted to support her dreams, especially since I had the means to do so without it impacting my finances.

L still hesitated and said she felt bad accepting money from me. I told her that I would feel really happy if she used it to invest in her future and that this was my way of supporting my friend. Eventually, she accepted, but I could tell she was still a bit uncomfortable with it.

Now, I’m second-guessing if I should have just let her figure it out on her own. I genuinely wanted to help, but I don’t want her to feel like I’m overstepping or making her feel indebted to me.

I tried to explain that I was just looking out for his fiancée's feelings and that family should be a priority, but he felt like I was undermining him.

After a few back-and-forth conversations, I decided to back off and let them figure it out on their own. I didn't want to create tension, and I thought it was best to let them have their discussions without me meddling. However, Thanksgiving dinner came around, and my brother brought up the wedding plans again. This time, his fiancée looked visibly upset, and my brother seemed frustrated. I felt bad for both of them, so I suggested they consider a compromise: a small ceremony at home for family and a bigger celebration later for friends. 

This led to an even bigger argument between them, and they ended up storming off to their separate rooms for the night. I felt terrible and didn't mean to create any conflict. I just wanted both of them to be happy. I apologized to them both afterward and told them I didn't mean to interfere. They eventually worked it out, but I’m left wondering if I overstepped by trying to intervene in their planning.

No one is the Asshole,"I live in an apartment complex where the walls are thin, and I share a wall with my neighbor, Sarah. We’ve always had a cordial relationship, but I’ve noticed that she often plays her music quite loudly, especially during late hours. I’m usually okay with a bit of noise, but sometimes it goes on until 2 AM, which makes it hard for me to sleep.

One night, around 1 AM, the music was louder than usual, and I decided to knock lightly on the shared wall to get her attention, hoping she would turn it down. I didn’t want to escalate things, just a gentle reminder that it was late.

To my surprise, Sarah came to my door a few minutes later, clearly irritated. She told me that she was having a small gathering with friends and that the music was part of the fun. I could see her point, as it’s nice to enjoy time with friends, but I explained that I had an early morning the next day and was having trouble sleeping.

We ended up in a bit of a back-and-forth where she felt I was being overly sensitive, and I felt she was being inconsiderate. Eventually, we reached a compromise: she agreed to keep the music at a reasonable volume after midnight, and I promised to communicate more directly in the future if her music was bothering me.

I left the conversation feeling a bit conflicted. I didn’t mean to ruin her fun, but I also needed my sleep. I wonder if my approach was too confrontational and if I should have just accepted the noise for one night.

No one is the Asshole,"I (30m) recently had an experience with my friend, Jake (31m), that left me feeling conflicted about whether I handled things the right way. 

A few months ago, Jake began a new job that he was really excited about. However, shortly after starting, he started complaining about how overwhelming it was, and I tried my best to be supportive. I would listen to him vent and offer advice when he asked for it. But as time went on, his complaints became more frequent, and he started to express feelings of inadequacy and frustration about how he was handling things. 

One day, he called me, sounding particularly down. He said he was thinking about quitting because he felt like he was failing at his job. I encouraged him to give it some more time, reminding him that every new job comes with a learning curve and that it's normal to feel overwhelmed at first. I shared my own experience with starting a challenging job and how it took me a while to get comfortable. 

However, the next week, he told me he did quit. I was surprised but tried to be understanding. I suggested we get together and talk about what he wanted to do next, but he declined, saying he just wanted to be alone for a while. I respected that and left it at that.

A few weeks later, I ran into a mutual friend, Sarah (29f), who mentioned that Jake was actually spending his time playing video games and hanging out with friends instead of job hunting. This shocked me because he had been presenting himself as someone who was really struggling and needed support. I decided to reach out to him, expressing my concern. I told him I felt like he wasn't taking his job situation seriously and that I was there for him if he wanted to talk about how to move forward.

Jake reacted defensively, saying that I didn't understand what he was going through and that he needed space. I felt hurt because my intention was to support him, not to criticize. After that conversation, we stopped talking for a while. 

Recently, Jake reached out and said he’d like to meet up to discuss things. I agreed, and we ended up talking things out. He admitted that he had been avoiding me because he felt embarrassed about how he had handled everything. We both apologized for the misunderstandings and came to a better understanding of each other’s perspectives. 

So, I'm left wondering, was I wrong for trying to encourage Jake to take his job situation seriously? Should I have just allowed him to handle things on his own without offering my opinion? Am I the asshole for trying to help a friend who was clearly in distress?",71,2929,0.55,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_76274,2018-04-18 00:00:00,NAH,2579,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I apologize if my story isn’t very clear; I’m still learning to express my feelings well.

So, here’s what happened: my best friend, who I’ll call Jess, recently found out that her mother has been diagnosed with a serious illness. It’s been a tough time for her and her family, and I’ve been trying to support her as much as I can. 

A few weeks ago, Jess asked me if I would be willing to help out by taking care of her younger siblings on weekends while her parents deal with hospital visits and treatments. I genuinely care about Jess and her family, and I want to help, but I also have my own commitments, including a part-time job and studying for finals. 

I told her that I would help out when I could, but I needed to maintain my own schedule to keep up with my responsibilities. Jess seemed disappointed and said that she really needed someone reliable to be there for her siblings. I understood her frustration, but I felt overwhelmed by the thought of taking on more than I could handle.

After our conversation, I felt torn. On one hand, I want to support my friend during this tough time, but on the other hand, I need to prioritize my own well-being and responsibilities. I ended up suggesting that maybe she could look for other friends or family members who might be able to help more consistently.

My partner has a younger sister (18) who is starting college in the fall, and she’s been really excited about it. To celebrate, we decided to host a small gathering with family and close friends.

We planned the party and everything was going well until my partner's sister mentioned how she was really hoping for a laptop to help with her studies. We had already discussed budgeting for the party and were trying to keep costs down, but my partner impulsively suggested we could help her buy a laptop. I was taken aback because I thought it was a bit much, especially since we are still settling into our new place and trying to manage our own finances.

When I expressed my concerns about the cost, my partner became defensive, saying that it was important to support family and that their sister really needed it. I agreed that she deserved support, but I suggested we could help in other ways—like offering to help her find a good used laptop or contributing a smaller amount toward her goal instead of buying her a new one outright.

Eventually, we reached a compromise where we agreed to help her find a used laptop and chip in a smaller amount, which everyone seemed happy with. I still felt a bit uneasy about the initial suggestion, but I understand that my partner wanted to help their sister celebrate this big milestone.

Last weekend, we decided to host a small gathering with a few friends. Since it was a nice day, we thought it would be great to hang out in the backyard. Before our friends arrived, my partner suggested we let the pets play together outside, thinking it would be fun to have them interact. I hesitated because Whiskers can be a bit territorial, but my partner insisted it would be fine.

When we let Max and Whiskers out together, things started off well. They sniffed each other and seemed curious. But then, out of nowhere, Whiskers hissed and swatted at Max, who, startled, barked loudly. This led to a bit of chaos as Max chased Whiskers up a tree, which left everyone laughing initially. However, I could tell that Whiskers was scared and upset.

I ended up having to climb the tree to get Whiskers down, and I was pretty frustrated by the whole situation. Afterward, I expressed to my partner that I didn’t think it was a good idea to force the pets to interact when they clearly had different comfort levels. My partner felt bad and apologized, but she also believed I was overreacting a bit since they had gotten along for a little while.

We talked it out later, and we both agreed to be more cautious about introducing our pets in the future. I think we both learned something from this experience, and it brought us closer in terms of understanding each other's concerns.

No one is the Asshole,"So, my friend Sarah recently decided to throw a surprise birthday party for our mutual friend, Jake. Sarah is a great planner and really wanted to make this special for Jake, who has been going through a tough time lately. I was excited to help and volunteered to handle the decorations.

We both agreed on a theme and decided to keep it under wraps, especially since Jake has a tendency to snoop around and find out surprises. Sarah asked me to keep things secret, and I promised to do so.

The week before the party, I accidentally mentioned the surprise to another friend, Lisa, while we were chatting. I quickly realized my mistake and started to panic. I told Lisa it was supposed to be a secret and begged her to keep it to herself. She assured me she wouldn’t say a word, and I hoped for the best.

Fast forward to the day of the party, everything was set up perfectly. But as Jake walked in, I noticed Lisa was there and she seemed a bit anxious. After we all shouted ""Surprise!"", I saw Jake's face drop a little. He then turned to me and asked, ""Did you tell Lisa about this?"" I was confused and said I hadn't, but then it hit me: Lisa must have figured it out when I mentioned it a week ago.

After the party, Jake confronted me, saying he felt let down that I had let it slip and ruined the surprise. I felt terrible; I never meant for him to find out. On the other hand, Lisa insisted that it wasn't my fault since she had promised to keep it a secret. Sarah was caught in the middle, trying to soothe both of us.

In the end, I understand how Jake feels—it was his special moment, and I never wanted to take that away from him. I truly feel bad about it, but it was an honest mistake.

So, I (27F) have a best friend, Alex (28M), and we've known each other for over a decade. We’re super close, and we often hang out just the two of us. Recently, I’ve started dating someone new, Jake (30M), and things are going really well.

Last weekend, I invited both Alex and Jake to a small gathering at my place with a few other friends. I thought it would be a great way for them to meet and for everyone to get to know each other. However, I noticed that during the gathering, Alex seemed a bit withdrawn. He wasn’t really engaging with Jake or the other guests, and I felt the tension.

After the party, I followed up with Alex to see how he felt about it. He opened up and told me that he felt left out and that he was worried he would lose our friendship now that I’m dating Jake. He mentioned he didn’t enjoy feeling like a third wheel, and he was nervous about how our dynamic might change.

I reassured him that he’s still incredibly important to me and that I didn’t want our friendship to suffer. I suggested we make some plans just for the two of us, like we used to do. However, I also told him that I want Jake to be part of my life and that I hope he can be okay with that.

Recently, I made a joke about her obsession with a certain reality TV show that she loves. I said something like, “You should really consider a career as a contestant; you’re practically a pro at drama!” 

She laughed at first, but then she suddenly got quiet and looked a bit hurt. I realized that maybe I crossed a line, especially since she had mentioned before that the show was a bit of an escape for her during a tough period in her life. I immediately apologized, saying that I didn’t mean to offend her and thought we were just joking around. 

At that point, she opened up about how the show had been a coping mechanism for her during some personal issues.

No one is the Asshole,"My friend and I have been close since high school, sharing many ups and downs together. Recently, we both got into a passionate hobby: woodworking. We started taking classes together and even began working on separate projects in our garages.

About a month ago, my friend approached me with the idea of starting a small business selling handmade furniture. I was excited about the concept and agreed to help him create a business plan. We spent hours brainstorming and sketching out designs. However, as we moved forward, I realized I wasn't ready to commit to a full business venture just yet, as I had other personal projects I wanted to focus on. I told him I would support him in any way I could, but I couldn't be a co-owner.

A couple of weeks later, he called me to let me know he had decided to go ahead and launch the business on his own. He asked if I would still help him with some of the woodworking and advice, which I happily agreed to. I thought we could maintain our friendship and collaborate without me being financially tied to the business.

After a few weeks of him running the business alone, I learned that he had secured a small local storefront and was doing well. I was genuinely happy for him but also felt a pang of regret for not being more involved. However, I also felt a bit left out, as he seemed to be spending all his time on this venture and less time with me.

One day, while we were working on a project in my garage, I expressed my feelings of being left behind and that I wished we could still work together on our hobby. He explained that he was just really focused on making the business a success and that he hoped I'd still support him.

We had a good conversation and agreed to set aside time each week for our woodworking hobby, separate from the business. I realized that while it was hard to see him moving forward without me, we could still maintain our friendship and find a balance.

No one is the Asshole,"I (28M) recently found myself in a tricky situation with my best friend, Sarah (27F), and her boyfriend, Jake (30M). Sarah and I have been friends since college, and I care about her deeply. I really wanted to support her when she started dating Jake, who I know from mutual friends but hadn’t really spent time with.

At first, things seemed great between them, but after a few months, I started to notice some red flags. Jake was often dismissive of Sarah's feelings and would make comments that I felt were disrespectful. I've always been the kind of friend who speaks up when I feel someone is being mistreated, so I decided to have a private conversation with Sarah.

I approached her carefully, expressing my concerns without being confrontational. I mentioned a few specific incidents where I felt Jake was not treating her well. Sarah got defensive and accused me of trying to break them up. I assured her that wasn’t my intention; I just wanted her to be happy and supported. She ended up telling me that I was overstepping and that it was her choice who she dated.

A few weeks passed, and I tried to give her space to sort things out. But then, during a group outing, I saw Jake make a particularly hurtful comment to Sarah that made her visibly upset. I felt I couldn’t stay silent anymore, so in the heat of the moment, I confronted Jake in front of everyone. I called him out for being disrespectful, which led to a big argument. Sarah was furious with both of us, saying I embarrassed her and made things worse.

I glanced over at Sarah and mentioned, ""Wow, they really shouldn't be having that conversation in public."" Sarah agreed, but then she suggested we should intervene, saying that perhaps they needed someone to help diffuse the situation.

I mentioned that I’d love to contribute but was unsure what to make since I didn’t know many local dishes. One of the members suggested that I should just buy something from a local restaurant, which seemed like a good idea to me.

She told me that I should have mentioned it earlier in our relationship because it was an important part of my life. I was taken aback because I didn’t think it was relevant to our current dynamic. I explained that while I loved singing, it had been years since I actively participated in music, and I didn’t see it as a major part of who I was now.

After a bit of a back-and-forth, we both calmed down. I understood her perspective on wanting to know more about my past, but I also felt like it wasn’t something I needed to bring up right away. We ended up resolving it, but I couldn't help but wonder if I should have mentioned my music background sooner.

No one is the Asshole,"A few months ago, I (29F) moved in with my friend Sarah (30F) after both of us needed a change in our living situations. We've known each other for years, and I thought it would be great to live together. We both have busy work schedules and enjoy a quiet home environment, so I believed it would go smoothly.

Initially, things were fantastic. We shared chores, kept open communication, and respected each other's space. However, about a month ago, Sarah started dating someone new. While I was happy for her, I was a bit taken aback when she mentioned that her new boyfriend, Jake (32M), had a past that included some minor legal issues, though she assured me he was trying to turn his life around.

At first, I tried to be supportive. I encouraged her to pursue her happiness, but as Jake began spending more time at our place, I felt quite anxious. He seemed nice enough, but I couldn't shake off my worries about his past. I mentioned my concerns to Sarah gently, stating that I felt more comfortable if the boyfriend didn’t spend the night frequently, especially since I didn’t know him well.

This sparked a conversation where Sarah expressed that she felt I was being overly cautious and judgmental without giving Jake a chance. I explained my feelings, emphasizing that I didn't want to interfere with her life but was taking into account my own comfort and safety in our shared space. She understood my point of view, but the discussion left us both a bit tense.

After some time, I decided to take a step back. I started spending more time out of the house, either with friends or at a nearby café, to give Sarah and Jake some space. Sarah appreciated my effort to give them privacy, and she tried to make time for us to hang out together as friends, which I appreciated. 

One evening, Sarah invited me to join them for dinner, which I agreed to do. I was nervous but wanted to support her. During the dinner, I remained polite and friendly, but I found myself unable to engage much with Jake. He was polite in return, but I still felt some apprehension.

After dinner, Sarah and I had a heart-to-heart, where she thanked me for being honest about my feelings. I expressed that I hoped she could see where I was coming from, and I didn’t want her to feel like she had to choose between me and her boyfriend. We both acknowledged that it was a complicated situation, but I encouraged her to be happy and live her life.

Now, we’ve struck a balance. I still maintain my boundaries about Jake being around too much, and Sarah respects that while also enjoying her time with him. We're both trying to navigate this new dynamic as friends and roommates, and I think we’re doing okay.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could use some outside perspective on whether I handled a situation poorly.

Last weekend, I was at a friend’s birthday party. It was a small gathering, and we were all having a great time. Toward the end of the evening, my friend decided to play some games, and one of them was a trivia game that required a lot of teamwork.

As we played, I noticed that one of the guests, who I hadn’t met before, was struggling to get involved. He seemed shy and was sitting quietly while everyone else was engaged in answering the questions. I felt kind of bad for him, so I made a point to ask him directly for his input on a question. 

He hesitated at first, but then he gave a really insightful answer that helped our team score points. After that, I kept encouraging him to speak up and share his thoughts, which he did, and he started to feel more comfortable as the game went on.

However, during a break between rounds, another friend of mine pulled me aside and said I was being too pushy and that I should let people participate at their own pace. I didn't mean to come off that way—I just wanted to include him and help him feel welcome. 

I later apologized to my friend for being overzealous, but I still feel conflicted. I genuinely wanted to help someone feel included, but I also didn't want to come off as pushy. Was I the asshole for trying to encourage someone who was shy? Or was I just looking out for him in a friendly way?",130,539,0.99,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_45840,2023-08-08 00:00:00,NAH,1467,AITA

As we all crowded together, someone accidentally stepped on my foot, and I instinctively yelped in pain. I tried to shake it off and smile for the photo, but I was obviously a bit distracted. After the photo was taken, I decided to step away for a moment to gather myself and calm the pain.

A few minutes later, I overheard some friends joking about my reaction, saying things like, ""Wow, someone can't handle a little foot traffic!"" and ""Did we break her?"" It was all in good fun, but it stung a little. I didn’t want to ruin the mood, so I laughed it off, but I felt a bit hurt.

Later in the evening, I decided to address it with my friend and let her know how I felt. I told her that while I appreciated the humor, I was genuinely in pain, and I would have preferred if they hadn’t made jokes at my expense. She apologized, saying she didn’t mean to make me feel bad and that everyone was just trying to keep the mood light.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I (24F) recently had a situation with my friends that I'm unsure about. A group of us decided to have a game night at my place, and I was really looking forward to it. We had planned it for weeks, and I had bought snacks and set up everything to make it cozy. 

A couple of days before the game night, one of my friends, Amanda (23F), texted me saying she wasn’t feeling great and might not be able to make it. I told her that was totally fine and that we’d miss her if she didn’t come. She replied that she might feel better by then and would let me know.

On the day of the game night, Amanda texted me in the afternoon saying she was feeling better and could come after all. I was excited and told her to come over! However, just a couple of hours before the game night was to start, she sent another message saying that she was feeling overwhelmed and thought it might be better for her to stay home to rest.

I completely understood where she was coming from, but I felt a bit disappointed since I had been looking forward to seeing her. I replied with a supportive message telling her that it was okay if she needed to rest but that we would miss her. I also mentioned that we could plan something together soon.

Later that night, while we were having fun, I posted some pictures on our group chat of us playing games and having a good time. I thought it would be a nice way to include her even though she wasn’t there. However, Amanda replied with a message that seemed a bit passive-aggressive, saying something like, “Thanks for rubbing it in that I’m not there.”

I immediately felt bad and tried to clarify that I wasn’t trying to make her feel bad about missing out. I told her I just wanted her to see how much fun we were having and that we really missed her. 

Now, I’m left wondering if I should have just not shared any pictures at all. Was I being insensitive by posting those photos while knowing she felt overwhelmed?

No one is the Asshole,"WIBTA for asking my friend to tone down her comments during family gatherings?

I (28F) have a close friend, Sarah (29F), who has a tendency to be very blunt and outspoken. I love her honesty, and we share a lot of the same values, but her comments can sometimes come off as harsh, especially around my family. My family is pretty traditional and sensitive about certain topics, and they value politeness and discretion in conversations.

Recently, during a family gathering, Sarah made a joke about my uncle's choice of career, which wasn't received well. It led to an awkward silence and my uncle getting visibly upset. I tried to brush it off, but it made the atmosphere uncomfortable for everyone, including me.

I’ve talked to Sarah about how her comments can come off as disrespectful to my family, and while she understands, she tends to forget when she’s in the moment. I don’t want to stifle her personality, but I also want to enjoy our family time without tension.

I’m considering having a conversation with her before our next family event to ask her to be more mindful of her comments. I want to frame it as a way to help her understand my family’s dynamics rather than as a demand. 

TL;DR: I want to ask my friend to be more considerate with her comments during family gatherings because they can be hurtful, but I don’t want to come off as trying to change her. Would I be the asshole for doing this?",122,1586,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_69474,2020-04-19 00:00:00,NAH,1417,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Sorry if this is long, I tend to over-explain.

I've been friends with this guy, Jake, since we were kids. We grew up in the same neighborhood and have always had each other's backs. Recently, Jake started dating this girl, Tara, and they've been together for about eight months now. Jake is head over heels for her, but I’ve noticed some red flags in their relationship that make me uneasy.

For one, Tara has a history of being fairly controlling. She often tells Jake what he can and cannot do, including who he should be friends with. She’s also quite dismissive of his feelings, which I’ve seen firsthand when we hang out as a group. I’ve talked to Jake about my concerns, and while he appreciates my honesty, he insists that he loves her and believes they have a strong connection.

The situation reached a boiling point during a weekend get-together at my place. We were all having a good time, but I noticed Tara getting visibly upset whenever Jake and I joked around or reminisced about our childhood. At one point, she snapped, telling him to stop being so “immature” and “grow up.” It was awkward, and Jake looked uncomfortable but didn’t say anything back. I could tell he was torn between wanting to defend himself and not wanting to upset her.

Later that night, I brought Jake aside and asked him if he was okay. I told him I was worried about how Tara treated him, and that it seemed to undermine his confidence. He said I was being too judgmental, and that he didn’t want to hear me talk negatively about her. I felt bad because I had only meant to look out for him. We ended up having a heated discussion, and I admitted that I thought he might be losing himself in this relationship. He got really defensive and said that I should trust his judgment in choosing his partner.

In the following days, he didn’t reach out like he usually does, and I felt really guilty. I thought maybe I had overstepped. A week later, he called me to talk. He said that he had reflected on our conversation and appreciated my concerns, but he also realized that he needed to stand up for himself more in the relationship. We ended up having a very productive discussion about boundaries, and he promised to communicate more openly with Tara.

So, while I was worried about him and he was initially upset, I think we both learned something from the situation. I genuinely care about Jake and just want him to be happy, even if that means he stays with Tara. I don’t know if I handled it perfectly, but I feel like we both grew from the experience, and I’m glad we could work it out.",1,1023,0.73,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_56977,2024-06-24 00:00:00,NAH,2581,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My roommate, Jake (24M), has a cat named Luna that he adopted a few months ago. I (22F) love animals and have always enjoyed having pets around, but when Jake got Luna, I made it clear to him that I was allergic to cats. He assured me that he would keep Luna in his room and that it wouldn't be a problem.

However, over time, I started to notice cat hair everywhere in the apartment. I would find it on my clothes, in the kitchen, and even on my side of the couch. I tried talking to Jake about it, asking him if he could keep Luna in his room more often, but he would say that Luna loves to roam and he didn’t want to confine her.

One day, I came home from work and found Luna sitting on my bed. I had a severe allergic reaction that night, which resulted in me having to go to the doctor. After that, I felt really frustrated with Jake. I explained to him that this was a serious health issue for me and that I needed him to respect my space and keep Luna out of my room entirely.

Jake apologized and mentioned that he would try harder, but it seemed like he wasn't making much of an effort. I suggested that perhaps he could keep Luna in a separate room when he wasn't around, or at least do a better job at cleaning up the fur. He seemed dismissive and told me that I was being too dramatic about a little cat hair.

Feeling overwhelmed, I decided to take matters into my own hands. The next day, while Jake was at work, I used a lint roller and cleaned up the common areas as much as I could. I also set up a barrier in the living room to keep Luna away from my side. When Jake came home, he was furious. He felt like I was overstepping by trying to control where Luna could go, and it led to a big argument between us.

In the heat of the moment, I said some things I regretted about him not being responsible, and he called me selfish for not understanding the bond he has with Luna. We both ended up feeling hurt and misunderstood.

After some time to cool off, we talked again and both expressed our frustrations. I realized that I could have approached the situation more calmly, and Jake acknowledged that he needed to be more considerate of my allergies and our shared living space.

Now we're working on finding a solution together, like creating a cat-free zone in the apartment and being more diligent about cleaning.

No one is the Asshole,"For context, I’m 19F.

Last summer, I volunteered at a local animal shelter for a few months. It was an incredible experience that helped me grow as a person and taught me a lot about responsibility and compassion. I fell in love with a particular dog there named Max, a sweet pit bull mix who had a rough past but was incredibly loving. 

After my time at the shelter, I decided to adopt Max. My parents were supportive but also worried about the commitment that came with taking care of a pet, especially since they both work full-time. I assured them that I was ready for the responsibility, and we agreed that I would take care of him primarily while I was still living at home.

Once I brought Max home, things went surprisingly well at first. However, I soon realized that he struggled with socializing, especially with new people and loud noises. My parents would often have friends over, and Max would become anxious and bark a lot, which frustrated my parents. They started making comments about how I needed to train him better or that I should consider giving him back. 

I felt stressed because I was trying my best to create a calm environment for Max, but it was hard when my parents were frequently inviting people over. I tried to explain that it would take time for him to adjust and that he needed a consistent routine. My parents, however, didn’t seem to understand and would sometimes get upset when I would ask them to keep the noise down or limit visitors.

After a few weeks of this tension, I had a heart-to-heart with my parents. I told them how much Max meant to me and that I was committed to helping him feel safe and comfortable. I also asked if we could work together to create a schedule for visits that would be less overwhelming for him. To my relief, they agreed, and we began to come up with a plan that worked for everyone.

In the end, we all had to make compromises. My parents learned to be more mindful of Max's needs, and I became more proactive about training him and managing his anxiety. We’ve since found a happy balance, and Max is thriving in our home.

Was I wrong to prioritize Max's comfort over my parents’ social plans, or did we all just need to communicate better?",556,1074,0.92,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_89996,2024-05-09 00:00:00,NAH,2218,AITA

However, after the party, my brother told me he felt overwhelmed and that I should have considered how having a lot of people over would affect him. I thought I had communicated well and respected his boundaries, but he feels like I was inconsiderate.

I understand that he has a different routine and that my friends might have disturbed him more than I realized. I didn’t intend to be disrespectful, and I genuinely thought we had an understanding.

No one is the Asshole,"Last month, my best friend and I were organizing a charity fundraiser for a local animal shelter. We were both really excited, and we put in a lot of effort to promote the event, gather donations, and plan activities for the day. A week before the event, she mentioned that she wanted to include a bake sale, which I thought was a great idea. However, she also said she wanted to bake all the goods herself.

I’ve always loved baking and have a few recipes I’m known for, so I gently suggested that we could do it together or that I could help her with the baking. She seemed a bit offended and said that she wanted to do it all herself to showcase her skills. I understood her desire to shine, so I backed off and offered to help with other aspects of the event.

The day of the fundraiser came, and she had made some really impressive baked goods. However, I noticed that a lot of them didn’t sell as well as we had hoped. Eventually, I suggested that we could lower the prices a bit to encourage more sales. She was hesitant at first but agreed after seeing that we only sold a few items.

By the end of the day, we managed to sell most of the baked goods, but I could see that she was a bit disappointed that her baking didn't draw as much attention as she had hoped. I tried to be supportive and praised her efforts, telling her that her baked items were delicious and that people were just drawn to other attractions at the event.

Afterward, we chatted about the day, and I could tell she was feeling a bit insecure about how her baking was perceived. I reassured her that it was a team effort and that the important thing was that we raised a good amount of money for the shelter. She smiled and said she appreciated my support.

I felt a bit bad that my initial suggestion to help might have inadvertently hurt her pride, but I also think it was important for me to offer my help. In the end, we both learned a lot from the experience, and I believe it brought us closer as friends.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently moved to a small town, and I’ve been trying to get to know my neighbors. There’s a community park nearby that hosts a lot of events, and one weekend the neighborhood association organized a potluck to bring everyone together. I thought it would be a great opportunity to meet people, so I decided to make a dish and attend.

On the day of the potluck, I noticed that one of my neighbors, Sarah, was setting up a table for her food and looked a bit overwhelmed. I offered to help her, thinking that it would ease her stress a bit. We started chatting as we arranged the food, and she mentioned that she had been feeling anxious about the event because she didn’t know many people in the neighborhood either.

As the potluck went on, I noticed that Sarah was getting quite a bit of attention for her dish, which was a beautiful homemade lasagna. I complimented her many times throughout the evening, and she seemed genuinely pleased. However, later in the evening, I overheard a few people discussing how they loved the lasagna and made comments about how they should invite her over for dinner sometime.

Feeling a bit left out, I decided to lighten the mood and jokingly said, “Wow, Sarah! Looks like everyone’s going to be asking you to be their personal chef from now on!” I meant it as a playful remark, but Sarah’s expression changed, and she looked a bit hurt. I immediately realized that it might have come off the wrong way, and I quickly apologized if I had offended her.

Afterward, Sarah approached me and told me that she had been feeling a bit insecure about her cooking skills and didn’t want to be put on the spot. I felt terrible and reassured her that she was amazing and that everyone was just excited about her food. We talked it out, and by the end of the evening, we were both laughing and felt more at ease.

I still feel uneasy about my comment, though. I never meant to make her uncomfortable, and I was just trying to have a bit of fun.

No one is the Asshole,"A little background: my partner and I have been together for three years. We both have demanding jobs and have always made an effort to support each other. Recently, my partner's mother was diagnosed with a serious illness, and it's been incredibly tough on their family. They live a few hours away, and since the diagnosis, my partner has been visiting them frequently to help out, which I completely understand and support.

About a month ago, my partner's mother had to go in for major surgery, and I encouraged my partner to go be with their family during this time. I wanted to be there for them, but I also knew it was important for them to be with their family. While my partner was away, I took care of our home and tried to keep everything running smoothly.

After the surgery, my partner decided to stay for a while to help out more, which I completely understood. However, I started feeling a bit overwhelmed. I had been managing everything alone, and while I was handling it, I began to feel lonely and missed my partner a lot. We usually spend our evenings together, and without that connection, I started to feel a bit lost.

I reached out to my partner to share how I was feeling, and to my surprise, they were very understanding. They told me they felt bad for being away and that they missed me too. We talked about the possibility of them coming back, but they also mentioned that their family really needed them right now, and they felt a sense of responsibility to stay longer.

I told my partner that I completely understand the situation and that family comes first. I want them to be there for their mother, but I also expressed how lonely I've been without them. We ended the conversation on a positive note, both agreeing that we need to keep communication open and support each other through this difficult time.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I want to share a situation that happened recently with my sister and our shared friend group. My sister and I have always been close, but we have our differences, especially when it comes to social events. I tend to be more extroverted and love meeting new people, while she’s more introverted and prefers smaller gatherings.

Last weekend, I organized a game night at my place and invited a bunch of our friends. I was really excited about it because I wanted to create a fun atmosphere where everyone could relax and enjoy themselves. I invited my sister, hoping she would join in on the fun, but I also knew she might feel overwhelmed.

The night of the event, my sister arrived a bit late. When she walked in, I was in the middle of a game and obviously having a good time. I didn’t immediately notice her because I was engaged in the game. But when I did see her, I ran over to give her a hug and introduced her to some new friends who had come. 

However, I noticed that she seemed a bit off the whole night. I later found out that she felt ignored because I was so caught up in the fun and didn’t take the time to check in on her when she first arrived. I realized that I had been so focused on making the night enjoyable for everyone that I may have overlooked her feelings.

After the event, my sister told me that she felt a bit left out and that she had a harder time integrating into the group than I had anticipated. I felt awful and apologized, saying I never intended to make her feel that way. I really wanted her to enjoy the night and thought she would mingle fine on her own.

Last year, his wife, Sarah (34F), was diagnosed with a serious illness, which has understandably put a strain on their family. They have two young kids, and I’ve been trying to help out where I can.

Recently, Jake asked me if I could take their kids for a weekend. He and Sarah needed some time to focus on her treatment and spend some quality time together. I readily agreed, knowing how much they needed it and wanting to support them.

While the kids were with me, I decided to take them out for a fun day at the amusement park. I wanted to make it special for them, especially given the tough times they've been through. However, Jake later texted me, upset that I had taken the kids out without consulting him first. He felt that he should have had a say in what we did, and he was worried that I might be trying to take their place as a parental figure.

I totally understand where he’s coming from; parenting is a sensitive subject, especially in their situation. But I thought that since I was helping out and trying to create a little joy for the kids, I was doing the right thing. 

I apologized for not checking in before making plans, and I assured him that my intentions were only to support them and have fun with the kids. We talked it out, and he ultimately accepted my apology, but I still feel conflicted about whether I crossed a line.

My best friend, who has been my study buddy throughout college, also graduated this year, and we’ve supported each other through thick and thin.

I completely understand and support her decision, but when she suggested we have a joint celebration, I started to feel uneasy.

My family has made sacrifices for me to get this degree, and I want to honor that with a special celebration just for us. I mentioned this to my friend, and she seemed disappointed, saying she thought it would be fun to combine our celebrations since we’ve been through this together. 

I’m not upset with her for wanting to share the spotlight; I just feel that my graduation deserves its own moment, especially considering my family’s support. I don’t want to hurt my friend’s feelings, but I also want to have a moment that feels personal to me.

No one is the Asshole,"M32 here, and I need to share a situation that happened recently with my partner ""Jordan,"" and our friends.

We've been together for about two years and have a pretty solid relationship overall. We both enjoy hanging out with our close group of friends, who are an eclectic mix of personalities and backgrounds. Recently, our friends decided to throw a big beach bonfire party for the weekend, which everyone was looking forward to.

A few weeks before the party, I learned that my childhood friend ""Sam,"" who I haven't seen in years, was going to be in town and wanted to catch up. Sam has always been a bit of a free spirit and can sometimes be unpredictable, but we had shared some great memories growing up. I decided it would be a good idea to invite Sam to the beach party so he could reconnect with me and meet my friends.

When I mentioned it to Jordan, they seemed apprehensive. Jordan expressed that they weren't sure how everyone would take to Sam, given his spontaneous nature and some of his past choices that had led to him being a bit of a wild card. I tried to reassure Jordan, saying that everyone is excited about the party and that Sam would be fine. We both discussed it further, and while Jordan didn’t outright forbid me from inviting him, I could tell they were uncomfortable.

I decided to go ahead and invite Sam anyway, thinking it would be a great opportunity for everyone to catch up and that they would warm up to him. Of course, when Sam showed up at the party, things didn’t go as smoothly as I had hoped. Sam was loud and a bit over the top, which made Jordan and a few others feel awkward. I could see Jordan’s discomfort grow throughout the night, and it led to a few tense moments.

After the party, Jordan and I had a heart-to-heart conversation. They explained that their concerns were valid; they didn't want the party to be overshadowed by someone who might not fit in. I understood where they were coming from and apologized for not considering their feelings more seriously before inviting Sam. 

I genuinely didn't mean to put Jordan in an uncomfortable position, and I can see how I could have been more considerate. In the end, we both agreed that it was a learning experience, and while I still value my friendship with Sam, I will be more mindful of how my choices affect our relationship in the future.

She was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a couple of years ago, and it’s been a tough journey for her. I’ve tried to be there for her as much as possible, but I also have my own life to manage, including my job and my own mental health.

Recently, Sarah reached out to me and asked if I could help her with a project. She wanted to organize a small get-together with our mutual friends, something to lift her spirits. I was excited about the idea but also concerned about her capacity to handle the social interaction given her current state. We talked about it, and I expressed that I wanted to support her, but I also suggested we keep it small and low-pressure.

Over the next few days, Sarah started inviting more people than I anticipated. I felt a bit overwhelmed because I was worried that if there were too many people, it might trigger her anxiety. I gently suggested scaling it down again, but she insisted she wanted everyone there for support. I understood her desire to feel connected, but I thought it might be too much.

The day of the gathering arrived, and Sarah was visibly anxious. I tried to help her prepare and manage the setup, and I also tried to make sure she was comfortable throughout the event. However, as more friends showed up, I could see her struggling to engage with everyone. Eventually, she retreated to her room, overwhelmed by the crowd.

I felt torn. I wanted to respect her wishes for having a big get-together, but I also worried that it was too much for her. After the event, she thanked me for organizing it and said it helped her feel less alone, even though she had a hard time during the actual gathering. But I couldn't shake the feeling that I might have overstepped by not being more assertive about my concerns.

I immediately realized that my joke hadn't landed well, and I felt bad for making her uncomfortable while she was already stressed about her business.

I gently expressed my concern to Sarah, saying that I might not be able to be as social as she wanted.

However, things got a bit complicated when I noticed that my roommate has a habit of leaving dirty dishes piled up in the sink for days. I tried to be understanding at first, thinking he might be busy with work or just adjusting to the new living situation.

I understood that everyone has their own way of managing their time and responsibilities, so I didn’t push it further.

Over the next few days, I made sure to clean up after myself and was patient. However, the situation didn’t improve.

So, a week before the move-out date, I checked in with her again. She expressed that she was feeling overwhelmed and hadn’t found anything yet. I felt a pang of guilt; I didn’t want to be the bad guy, but we really needed our home back to ourselves.

In the end, she agreed to extend her stay for another month while she continued her search, and I offered to help in any way I could. We both cried a little, realizing that this was a tough situation for all involved. I felt relieved but also conflicted about whether I had done the right thing by pushing her to find a new place.

No one is the Asshole,"I'm a 30-year-old guy who loves cooking and experimenting with different cuisines. Friends often come to me for dinner parties, and I enjoy showcasing my skills. Recently, I hosted a dinner for a small group of friends, and I decided to try my hand at making a traditional dish from a culture I admire.

As I was preparing, I realized I didn’t have all the ingredients, so I made some substitutions. I thought the changes would still yield a tasty result. When my friends arrived, they were excited to taste my creation. However, during dinner, some of them noticed the differences from the traditional recipe and commented on it. One friend in particular, who is very passionate about food and culture, expressed disappointment about the substitutions and suggested that I should have stuck to the original recipe.

I felt a mixture of embarrassment and frustration because I wanted to share something new with them but also respect the traditional dish. In the moment, I tried to explain my choices and why I thought it would still be enjoyable. The conversation became a bit heated, and while we eventually laughed it off, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I might have overstepped by trying to put my spin on a beloved dish.

Afterward, I reached out to my friend to apologize if I had offended her. She assured me that she appreciated my efforts and understood I meant no harm, but she just felt strongly about the traditional recipe. I appreciated her perspective, and we both agreed that food can be a wonderful way to share cultures, as long as we approach it with an open mind.

I believe we both learned something from the experience and that it’s okay to have differing views on food, especially when it comes to tradition versus innovation. I'm curious if anyone else has been in a similar situation where cultural appreciation and personal expression collided.",643,1329,0.91,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_42947,2019-04-26 00:00:00,NAH,1873,AITA

Recently, we attended a family gathering in Spain, where I was introduced to many of his relatives for the first time. During dinner, his grandmother started talking about a traditional Spanish dish she wanted to prepare for us, which is made with ingredients I’m allergic to. 

When she asked if I’d like to try it, I politely declined, explaining my allergy and how I have to be cautious about what I eat. She seemed a bit disappointed and insisted that I try a small bite, saying it was a family tradition and very special to her. I reiterated that I couldn’t due to my allergy, and I suggested trying a different dish that would be safe for me.

Later that evening, my partner expressed that he felt I could have been more accommodating to his grandmother's wishes. He said it hurt her feelings that I wouldn’t even try a tiny bit of the dish, even though I explained the situation. I feel bad that she was disappointed, but I also believe I did the right thing by prioritizing my health.

On this particular day, there were a few families having picnics, kids playing, and other dogs running around too.

I noticed a family setting up a picnic right next to the area where I usually throw the ball for my dog. I always try to be considerate, so I approached them and asked if it would be okay for my dog to play in that space since it was right next to their picnic. They smiled and said it was fine, so I started throwing the ball for my dog.

However, as the game went on, my dog got a little too excited and accidentally knocked over a drink from their picnic table while chasing the ball. The drink spilled everywhere, and I immediately rushed over to apologize. The family was a bit startled but mostly laughed it off, saying it was just a drink and not a big deal. I offered to help clean it up and even offered to replace the drink, but they insisted it was fine.

After that, I decided it might be best to move a little further away from their picnic to avoid any more accidents. I felt bad about the whole situation, even though they seemed to take it in stride.

Fast forward to our late teens, and my sibling decided to pursue a career in art. They enrolled in a local art school, which was a huge financial commitment for our family. I supported my sibling's decision wholeheartedly, but I noticed that they were struggling to make ends meet with the costs of supplies and tuition. 

One day, I casually mentioned to my sibling that while I admired their dedication, I was concerned about the financial burden it placed on our parents. I suggested they consider taking on a part-time job or looking for scholarships to lighten the load a bit. My sibling reacted quite defensively, feeling that I was undermining their dreams and passion. We ended up in a heated argument that led to some hurt feelings.

After some time apart, we both took a step back and realized that we both had good intentions. My sibling was pursuing a dream that was important to them, while I was worried about our family’s financial stability.

No one is the Asshole,"So, a little background: I have a close-knit group of friends, and we often joke around with each other. One of my friends, Mark, is really into photography and has been working on building his portfolio for a while now. He takes incredible pictures and has a great eye for detail.

Recently, Mark asked us to help him with a photoshoot for his portfolio. He wanted to capture some candid moments of us hanging out, so we all agreed. During the shoot, I was trying to lighten the mood and make everyone laugh, so I started joking about how I’d be the “model of the year” with my “expert posing skills.” It was all in good fun and everyone was laughing.

After the shoot, Mark decided to use some of the photos for his portfolio, and when he shared them with us, I noticed that he had edited one of the pictures where I was striking a silly pose. I thought it was hilarious and joked that I was going to be famous for my “unique modeling style.” However, when I saw the final edit, I noticed that he had made me look a bit silly, and I realized it might not be what I expected.

I mentioned to Mark that while I appreciated his creativity, I felt a bit awkward about how I looked in that particular photo. He took it well but said that he thought it was funny and artistic, and he wanted to showcase a more playful side. I understood where he was coming from, but I also felt like I should have had more of a say in how I was portrayed, especially since I’m not a model.

After a few days, I decided to express my feelings more clearly, letting him know that I didn't mind him using the other photos but that I wasn’t comfortable with the one where I looked silly. He seemed genuinely surprised and apologized for not considering my feelings more. We talked it out, and he agreed to take that particular photo out of his portfolio.

In the end, we both realized that our intentions were good, and we valued each other's perspectives. Mark appreciated my honesty, and I appreciated his creativity. We both learned something from the experience and went back to joking around like usual.

No one is the Asshole,"I’ve recently moved to a new city for work, and while I’m excited about the opportunities, I’ve been feeling pretty lonely. I don’t really know anyone here, and I haven’t had much time to make friends since I’ve been busy with my job. 

Last week, I decided to host a small dinner party at my apartment to meet some new people. I invited a few coworkers, some neighbors I’d chatted with, and even a couple of acquaintances from a local club I’m part of. I wanted to create a relaxed atmosphere, so I prepared a mix of dishes, both from my culture and some popular American favorites.

The gathering went well, and everyone seemed to enjoy the food and company. However, there was one moment that I regret. I had a couple of friends who are also new to the city but from different countries, and naturally, we started chatting in our native languages. It felt good to connect over shared experiences, but I noticed that a few guests looked a little uncomfortable. They were polite and smiled, but I could tell they didn’t understand what we were saying. 

After a few minutes, I caught myself—to be inclusive, I switched back to English and encouraged everyone to join the conversation. Later that evening, I overheard someone say to another guest that they felt left out when we spoke in another language. I apologized and explained that it wasn’t intentional; I just got caught up in the moment.

I felt bad for making anyone uncomfortable, but at the same time, I think it’s natural for people to gravitate toward their own language, especially when they are with someone who understands them. I’ve been trying to be more mindful since then, but I also wonder if it’s too much to expect people to always be comfortable in a mixed-language setting. 

Overall, I believe everyone had a good time, but I still feel conflicted about the situation and wonder if I handled it poorly.

My best friend (F27) had been planning her wedding for over a year, and I was already committed to being part of her special day. I told my sister how much this meant to me and that I wouldn’t be able to attend her wedding if she went through with that date. She was upset, saying that she felt like I was prioritizing my friend over her, and that we couldn't find a date that worked for everyone due to venue restrictions.

I (32F) have been working as a freelance graphic designer for the last few years. It’s been a mix of great clients and some really difficult ones, but I love my work. Recently, I started collaborating with my best friend, Jake (33M), who is a photographer. We both have a lot of talent and have been trying to get our small business off the ground.

About a month ago, we were approached by a local non-profit organization that wanted us to create some promotional materials for their upcoming fundraiser. It was a fantastic opportunity, and we were both really excited. We agreed on a budget and timeline, and everything was going smoothly until the day before the final materials were due.

Jake called me in a panic, saying that he had a family emergency and needed to leave town for a few days. He asked if I could handle the project alone, assuring me he would be available for any questions via phone. I agreed to take it on, but I ended up having to redo a lot of his work because I had a different vision for the final product. I communicated with him throughout the day, but as the deadline approached, I was feeling overwhelmed. 

The next day, I submitted the materials to the non-profit, and they were thrilled with the final product. Afterward, Jake returned, and I was excited to show him what I had done. However, he was upset. He felt like I didn't respect his vision and that I should have stuck to the original ideas instead of changing them. I explained that I was under a lot of pressure and hoped he would understand, but he felt that I had taken over the project.

My roommates are really into having a good time, which often involves partying on weekends. I’m not opposed to social gatherings, but I have a pretty heavy workload this semester with exams and projects, and I’ve been trying to focus on my studies. I’ve always been someone who prefers quiet study sessions to loud parties, and I’ve communicated this to my roommates.

The issue started when they decided to throw a party last weekend. They didn’t give me a heads up that it was happening, and it ended up getting pretty loud. I tried to study in my room, but the noise was unbearable. I eventually got frustrated and went out to the living room to ask them to keep it down. They reacted defensively, claiming that they were just trying to have fun and that I should join in instead of being a “party pooper.”

I understood their perspective. After all, it’s their space too, and I don’t want to take away their right to enjoy it. However, I also felt that they should be considerate of my need to study, especially since it was a crucial time in the semester. I ended up sitting there for a bit, feeling out of place, until I decided to retreat back to my room.

I spoke to her about it casually the other day, and she immediately brushed it off, saying she didn’t want me to spend so much money on her.

Recently, she started a new job that she’s really excited about, but it requires her to work late hours. Her schedule has changed, and she often feels overwhelmed trying to balance work and her personal life.

A few weeks ago, she asked if I could help her with her two kids, ages 7 and 5, a couple of times a month so she could focus on her work deadlines. I agreed because I know how tough it can be to juggle responsibilities. We discussed it, and I felt good about being able to help out.

Last week, I planned a small get-together at my house with some friends. It was a rare chance for me to catch up with everyone, and I had been looking forward to it for weeks. The day before the get-together, my friend texted me to say that she needed my help the same evening because her husband had a work commitment and she had a deadline to meet. I felt torn; I wanted to support her, but I also didn’t want to cancel my plans with my friends.

I responded honestly, letting her know that I already had plans and couldn’t help that night. I offered to babysit for her another day when she was in need. She was disappointed, and I could hear the frustration in her voice, but she understood my position. 

Afterward, I felt guilty for prioritizing my social plans over helping her when she needed it. I talked to another friend about it, and they reassured me that it was okay to have my own plans.

So here’s the situation: My partner (30) and I (28) recently found out that we are moving to a new city for work. We have a group of friends that we’ve been really close with for the past few years. Since we’re moving in a few months, we wanted to throw a farewell party to celebrate our time together and say goodbye properly.

I took the lead on planning the party because I enjoy organizing events. I set a date and invited everyone, but I also suggested we do a potluck-style dinner to keep costs down. My partner was on board, but I got a bit carried away and started assigning dishes to everyone. I thought it would be fun to have a variety of food, but some friends expressed that they felt pressured by my assignments.

One friend in particular was really upset and felt like I was taking away the fun of potluck by assigning dishes instead of allowing everyone to bring what they wanted. I didn’t realize how it came across until they mentioned it. I apologized and told them they could bring whatever they wanted. 

The party went great overall, but I still feel a bit bad about how I handled the potluck planning. A friend mentioned that we could have all discussed it together first. I genuinely didn’t mean to come off as bossy; I just got excited about the party.

No one is the Asshole,"I've recently gone through a tough time with my health. A few months ago, I was diagnosed with a chronic illness that has significantly changed my lifestyle. While I’m learning to manage it, there are days when I really struggle, both physically and emotionally.

I have a close group of friends who are very supportive, and they often invite me out for various activities. However, because of my condition, there are many times when I have to decline their invitations, especially if it involves physical activity or staying out late. I hate missing out on the fun and feeling like I'm letting them down, but I also know my health has to come first.

One of my friends had a birthday party recently, and I really wanted to go, but I was having a particularly bad week. I texted her and explained that I wouldn’t be able to make it, and I felt awful about it. She responded with understanding, but I could sense that she was disappointed.

A few days later, I saw pictures from the party on social media. Everyone looked so happy, and I felt a wave of sadness hit me. I couldn't help but think about how much I missed being part of those moments. I ended up messaging my friend to express how I felt, sharing that it hurt to see the pictures and admitting that I was struggling with missing out. She was really supportive and said she understood, but I still felt like I was burdening her with my feelings.

Now, I’m wondering if I was wrong to share my feelings with her. I didn't want to make her feel guilty for having fun without me, but I also felt like I needed to be honest about my emotional state.

A few weeks later, I had planned a small dinner party at my house with a few friends, including her. I wanted to create a light atmosphere to help her take her mind off things. I also invited a new friend I’d made, who was going through some mental health challenges and could use some support as well.

During the dinner, my new friend began to share their own struggles, and while it was important to listen, the conversation turned quite serious and heavy. My friend, still reeling from her breakup, started to visibly disengage and looked increasingly uncomfortable.

I noticed her discomfort and tried to steer the conversation back to lighter topics, but my new friend kept bringing it back to their issues. Eventually, my best friend got up to excuse herself to the bathroom and ended up leaving the party without telling anyone. I felt awful when I realized she had left and I had not been able to help her feel supported.

After the dinner, I reached out to her to apologize and let her know I didn’t mean to make her feel uncomfortable. She told me she appreciated it but felt overshadowed by the heavy conversation and wished I had managed the discussion better. I explained that I was trying to support both her and my new friend, but I could understand how it felt.

No one is the Asshole,"Context: I recently started volunteering at a local animal shelter, and I've been really enjoying my time there. It’s a small place, and we often have special events to promote animal adoption. Last weekend, we organized an open house event on Saturday from 10 AM to 4 PM, where people could come in, meet the animals, and learn more about the shelter.

As the event was wrapping up around 3:30 PM, a group of about six people came in, clearly excited to look at the animals. I was tidying up and making sure everything was in order for the next day’s operations, but I noticed them browsing. I went over and let them know that the event was ending soon, and while they were welcome to look around, I would need to start closing up in about 30 minutes.

They thanked me and assured me they would just take a quick look. About ten minutes later, I noticed them still engaged with the animals, and I started gathering supplies and cleaning up, but I kept checking in to see if they needed anything.

When it got to 4 PM, I approached them again and politely explained that we were closing down and that I needed to start securing the animals for the night. They seemed a bit disappointed, saying they had just arrived and wanted to spend more time with the pets. I empathized with them and suggested that they could come back the next day when we were open again.

At that point, one of them, who seemed really passionate about adopting a dog, expressed frustration and said they felt like they were being rushed out. I could see they were genuinely interested and didn't want to leave empty-handed. I told them I completely understood, and I offered to let them stay just a little longer, as long as they helped me with closing duties afterward.

They were grateful for the chance to stay a bit longer, and we ended up chatting while finishing up. They ended up leaving with some valuable information about the animals and promised to think about coming back to adopt.

Later, I found out that one of the volunteers felt I should have asked them to leave immediately at closing time and mentioned that I might have wasted an opportunity for adoption. I didn’t mean to offend anyone; I just wanted to balance the needs of the visitors with the shelter’s closing routine.

No one is the Asshole,"I grew up in a household where my parents had very different views on money. My dad was a saver, always frugal and careful with spending, while my mom was a spender who often justified her purchases as necessary for family happiness. I always felt caught in the middle. 

Recently, I’ve started saving for my own house. I’m in my late 20s and I really want to achieve this goal. I’ve been living a pretty minimalist lifestyle, cutting back on eating out, subscriptions, and other non-essentials. I even picked up a side hustle to increase my savings.

Last week, I visited my parents, and my mom was excited to show me the new furniture she bought for their living room. It was beautiful, but I couldn’t help but feel a pang of frustration. I asked her how much it cost and she casually mentioned it was a few thousand dollars, all on credit. I couldn’t hold back and ended up saying something like, “You know, this is exactly why you can never save for anything important. You just buy what you want and worry about the consequences later.” 

My mom got really upset and said that I didn’t appreciate how hard she worked to make their home beautiful and comfortable. My dad chimed in, saying I was being rude and disrespectful to my mom’s choices. I felt like I was just trying to look out for them, but the conversation turned into a heated argument.

I later apologized for the way I phrased things, but I still feel like my point about financial responsibility is valid. I’m worried that my parents' spending habits might affect their future stability, but I also recognize that it’s their money and their choices.

After a couple of meetings, I noticed that one member, Sarah (28F), consistently brings snacks and drinks for everyone, which is really nice of her.

Sarah's demeanor changed immediately, and she bluntly said, ""This is my thing, and I prefer to handle the snacks."" 

I felt uncomfortable, but I understand that everyone has their own preferences. So, to keep the peace, I decided to bring a small pack of store-bought cookies instead, thinking it would be a nice addition without stepping on her toes.

I was a bit surprised; I always imagined throwing a big celebration for her. I expressed my feelings about wanting to do something bigger, and she was really appreciative but firm in her decision. She explained that she wanted to keep it low-key and focus on quality time rather than a big event.

We invited close friends and family, wanting to create a warm atmosphere where everyone could enjoy good food and company. We put a lot of effort into the preparations, including cooking a three-course meal and decorating the dining area.

One of our friends, Sarah, has been vegan for several years, and while we always try to accommodate her dietary restrictions, we were unsure if she would attend since she often has other plans. To be safe, we included a couple of vegan dishes in the menu, but we also prepared some non-vegan options for the other guests. As the evening progressed, everyone seemed to enjoy the food, and Sarah was thrilled with the vegan options we provided.

Midway through the dinner, Sarah expressed her excitement about the dishes and casually mentioned how she sometimes feels left out at social gatherings where there’s no vegan food available. I took that opportunity to tell her how much I appreciate her commitment to her lifestyle and how we always want her to feel included. We had a great conversation about food choices, diets, and how everyone has different preferences.

However, towards the end of the night, one of our other friends made a comment about how ""it must be hard to live without cheese."" It was meant to be lighthearted, but I could see Sarah’s expression change. She responded by explaining how she chooses veganism for ethical reasons and that comments like these can be discouraging. I could see both sides of the conversation, and while I didn't agree with the comment, I understood it came from a place of ignorance rather than malice.

After the dinner, I reached out to Sarah to check in, and she thanked me for the vegan dishes and for being supportive during the evening. We both agreed that it’s important to have open conversations about dietary choices and respect each other's lifestyles.

I'm in a bit of a situation with my younger brother, and I'm hoping for some perspective. 

I (28M) have always been the more responsible sibling, while my brother (22M) has lived a carefree life. He recently graduated from college with a degree in environmental science, which is great, but he has no clear career path. He’s been working part-time at a local coffee shop while trying to figure things out, but he's struggling to find anything more stable. 

A few months ago, he approached me asking if he could move in with me for a while. I live in a two-bedroom apartment and was initially open to it, but then he mentioned he would like to live rent-free. I really didn’t feel comfortable with that, as my own finances are tight. I suggested that he could move in, but he would need to contribute to rent and utilities to help out. 

This sparked a huge argument. He accused me of being unsupportive and not understanding his struggles. I mean, I get it; he’s in a tough spot, but I also have my own bills to pay and savings to consider. I offered to help him with job applications and even suggested he take some online courses to improve his employability, but he was really upset about the rent situation. 

Eventually, I told him that if he can’t contribute anything, it might be best for him to find another living arrangement for now. He hasn't spoken to me since and I feel pretty guilty about it. I just wanted to set some healthy boundaries.

I felt bad because I genuinely wanted everyone to have a good time, including Lisa. It ended up being an awkward night, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that maybe I did overstep.

I've since reached out to Lisa to check in and apologize again for not being more considerate of her feelings. She appreciated the gesture but said she still felt overwhelmed at the party. 

So, am I the asshole for trying to get everyone to have fun and not realizing Lisa was in a sensitive place?",203,1047,0.79,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_28153,2024-06-20 00:00:00,NAH,1759,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"A few days ago, I went to a local café to get some work done. It was a Saturday afternoon, and the place was buzzing with people chatting and enjoying their drinks. I managed to snag a small table near the window, which I prefer because it allows good natural light for my laptop.

After about an hour of working, I noticed a woman standing nearby, looking a bit distressed. She approached me and said, “Excuse me, I hope you don’t mind, but I have a friend who is waiting for me, and we wanted to sit together. Would you be interested in moving to another table?”

I looked around and saw that the café was indeed packed. There were two other small tables available, but they were a bit farther from the window and not as comfortable. I appreciated her friendliness and understood her situation, but I was also quite focused on my work and didn’t want to lose my good spot.

I replied, “I’m really sorry, but I’ve settled in here and I’m in the middle of something important. If it’s okay, I’d prefer to stay at this table.”

She nodded and smiled, saying, “I completely understand. No worries!” She thanked me and went to find another table for herself.

A few minutes later, I noticed her friend arrived, and they ended up sitting at a table nearby. They chatted and laughed, and I couldn’t help but feel a bit guilty for not moving, even though I didn’t think I was in the wrong. 

Was I too selfish for not switching tables when she asked?",652,2509,0.83,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_50671,2023-08-27 00:00:00,NAH,1444,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"A couple of months ago, my cousin had a huge falling out with her parents over a life choice they disagreed with. They’ve always been a bit controlling, especially when it comes to her education and career path, and she decided to quit her job and pursue her passion for art full-time. It didn’t go over well, and they cut her off financially.

Seeing her struggle, I offered to let her stay with me temporarily while she gets back on her feet. I live in a small apartment, but I have a spare room and figured it could help her clear her head. She accepted, and I was happy to support her during this tough time.

However, after a few weeks, I noticed that she was spending a lot of time on social media and connecting with people who had a very different lifestyle than ours. They were all about the free-spirited, no plans, live in the moment mentality, which started to influence her thinking and decisions. She began dismissing any practical advice I gave her about budgeting or job hunting, insisting that she was just going to “let the universe guide her.”

I tried to be supportive but also felt the need to point out that she might want to have a backup plan. This led to some heated discussions where she accused me of not believing in her dreams. I then mentioned that while I respect her choices, I was worried about her not having any stability, especially since she was living in my space.

Things came to a head when she decided to throw a small gathering with her new friends at my place without asking me first. I didn’t want random strangers in my home, especially since I was still getting used to having someone else living there. I asked her to keep it low-key and respectful of my space, which resulted in a big argument. 

Afterward, I felt awful about how the situation escalated, but I also didn’t want to feel like my home was being taken over without my consent. I told her I was willing to help her as long as she respected my boundaries. It’s been a bit tense since then, and she ended up moving out.

Now I’m left wondering if I was too harsh with her, or if I was right to set boundaries in my own home. Am I the Asshole for wanting to maintain my space and my own lifestyle while trying to help her?",23,2676,0.52,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_63650,2020-02-27 00:00:00,NAH,2230,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I'm in a bit of a dilemma and could use some perspective on the situation. My best friend, who I'll call Jake, is about to have his first child with his partner, Lisa. They’re both really excited, and naturally, a baby shower is being planned. I’ve been asked to help organize it, which I’m happy to do.

Here's where it gets tricky: my sister, who has been trying to conceive for a while now, is feeling really down about her situation. She’s supportive of Jake and Lisa, but I know that every baby announcement or event is a reminder of what she's been struggling with. I want to support my sister, but I also don’t want to exclude her from Jake's baby shower.

I talked to Jake about it, and he was understanding, suggesting that we could keep it low-key and make sure my sister feels included. So, we decided to invite her but also to have a chat with her beforehand to make sure she's okay with coming. I told her about the shower and asked if she’d be comfortable joining us. She hesitated but eventually said she would come, saying she didn’t want to miss out on celebrating with Jake.

The day of the shower arrived, and my sister seemed to be doing fine at first. However, as the event went on, I noticed she was becoming more withdrawn. I felt torn; I wanted her to enjoy the day, but I also didn’t want to put her in a position that could hurt her feelings. At one point, I pulled her aside to check in, and she confessed she felt a bit overwhelmed but appreciated being included.

I ultimately decided to give her the option to leave if she needed to, and she chose to stay for a while longer but eventually left early. I felt guilty for putting her in a situation that might have been triggering, but I also wanted to support Jake and Lisa's celebration.

So, I'm left wondering: Am I wrong for including my sister in a baby shower for my best friend, knowing she’s struggling with her own fertility journey? I genuinely wanted to celebrate Jake and Lisa while also trying to support my sister. It feels like a delicate balance, and I'm not sure if I handled it the best way.

No one is the Asshole,"I always enjoyed cooking and trying new recipes, so when a close friend of mine asked if I would host a small dinner party for her birthday, I gladly agreed. I wanted to make it special for her, so I spent a good amount of time planning a menu that included her favorite dishes and a couple of new things I wanted to experiment with.

As the day approached, I texted our mutual friends to invite them and let them know what I was planning. I asked them to bring drinks or dessert to share, which they all happily agreed to. The night of the party, everything was going smoothly. I had cooked a delicious meal, set the table nicely, and even made a homemade birthday cake.

When everyone arrived, my friend was thrilled and seemed to really appreciate the effort I put into the evening. However, during dinner, one of our friends brought up a recent conversation they had with another mutual friend who couldn't make it to the party. This friend was struggling with some personal issues and had mentioned feeling left out of our group's gatherings lately.

The conversation quickly turned into a discussion about how we could be more inclusive and reach out to this friend. I fully agreed that it was important to support our friend, but I was also feeling a bit overwhelmed. I had worked hard to create a nice atmosphere for my friend's birthday, and I was concerned that the focus was shifting away from the celebration.

I expressed that I thought it was wonderful that we wanted to support our struggling friend, but I felt that maybe we could save that discussion for another time, considering it was a birthday dinner. My friends understood where I was coming from, but the mood became a bit tense. We ended up wrapping up the conversation and returning to the celebration, but I felt a little guilty for wanting to keep the focus on my friend's special day.

After the party, I reflected on the situation and wondered if I should have just kept quiet about my feelings. I didn't want to seem unsupportive or dismissive, but I also wanted my friend to enjoy her birthday without overshadowing it with heavier topics.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently went on a few dates with someone I really clicked with. Our conversations were full of laughter and shared interests. We both enjoyed hiking and exploring new places, so it felt natural to plan an outdoor adventure together for our next outing.

On our hiking date, we were discussing our favorite outdoor activities when they mentioned a local group that organizes hikes and community service projects. I thought it sounded great and asked them more about it. They lit up, explaining how they’ve made a lot of friends through the group and how it promotes environmental awareness, which I totally support.

However, they also mentioned that the group sometimes engages in activities that some people might find unconventional, like meditation circles in the woods or group discussions about personal growth. I was intrigued but also a bit hesitant because it felt a bit too “new age” for my taste. I asked them for more details, but they seemed to get a little defensive, saying they didn’t want to share everything right away and that not everyone understands their approach.

At that moment, I felt a bit uncomfortable because I couldn’t tell if it was just a harmless group or something more intense. I didn't want to hurt their feelings, but I also didn't want to get involved in something I wasn't sure about. I decided to be honest and told them that while I appreciated their passion, I felt a bit uneasy about the group's activities. They understood and reassured me that it was all about positivity and community, but I couldn't shake my concern.

After that conversation, we both decided to take a step back and reflect. We agreed to keep things friendly but acknowledged that maybe we weren’t on the same page about certain values. I think we both wanted what was best, but it was clear that this difference could be a dealbreaker for a relationship. 

So, here I am wondering if I was wrong to express my feelings about the group, or if I was just being honest about my discomfort.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently reconnected with an old friend from high school. We hadn’t spoken in years, but when we started chatting again, it felt like no time had passed. We decided to meet up for coffee to catch up and rekindle our friendship.

During our conversation, she opened up about her struggles with anxiety and depression. It was really touching to hear her share her experiences, and I wanted to support her. However, I realized that I often struggle with anxiety myself, and while I’m usually good at helping others, I found it hard to navigate how to be there for her while managing my own feelings.

As we talked, I shared some of my own experiences, and we both found comfort in knowing we weren’t alone. But then she mentioned that she was considering therapy, and I encouraged her to go for it. I genuinely believed it could help her, but I also realized I hadn't pursued therapy for myself, despite knowing it might be beneficial. 

After our meeting, I felt conflicted. I wanted to be a good friend and encourage her to take that step for herself, but I also felt like a bit of a hypocrite for not taking my own advice. I reached out to her later to apologize if I seemed pushy about therapy, and she reassured me that she appreciated my concern. We both agreed that it’s a journey and that we would support each other in our own ways.

In the end, I think we both realized that it's okay to not have everything figured out, and that sometimes just being there for each other is enough.

After our conversation, I pondered if I should reconsider moving or if I should have kept my ambitions to myself to spare her feelings. I also worry that by focusing on my career, I might be hurting my friends, especially Mia. I don’t want to be seen as someone who puts their own interests above their friendships.

Recently, one of my close friends, Jake, started a small business making handmade furniture. He put a lot of work into it, and we were all excited to see him succeed.

A few months ago, Jake asked if he could use my garage to store some of his larger pieces while he was getting his business off the ground. I agreed without hesitation, thinking it would be a temporary arrangement. However, what started as a few pieces turned into an entire workshop filled with wood, tools, and furniture, taking up all the space in my garage. 

I approached Jake about it after a couple of months. I expressed my concerns that it had become overwhelming and that I needed some space back. He seemed genuinely surprised and a bit hurt, saying he thought I was fine with it and that he was just trying to make his business work. I felt bad, but I also knew I needed my garage back to use for my own projects.

We had a long conversation where I assured him that I supported him, but I needed him to find a proper storage solution by the end of the month. Jake agreed, although I could tell he was disappointed. After that, he started looking for a rental space to move his stuff, but it was taking longer than expected.

During this time, our mutual friends started to weigh in. Some supported me, saying it was fair for me to reclaim my space, while others felt I was being unsupportive and that I should have let him keep using my garage as long as he needed. Their mixed opinions caused some tension in our friend group, leading to awkward interactions.

Eventually, Jake found a storage unit and moved his things out, and our friendship has started to heal. I felt guilty for needing my space but also justified in wanting to reclaim my garage.

About a year ago, I started dating ""Emily,"" and we quickly fell for each other. We have a lot in common and enjoy spending time together, but there have been some bumps along the way. I have a close-knit group of friends, and we often hang out together, including my best friend ""Mike."" Emily has always been supportive of my friendships and has enjoyed getting to know my friends.

Recently, we planned a weekend camping trip with Mike and a couple of other friends. We were all really excited about it, but a few days before the trip, Mike called me and shared that he was feeling anxious about going. He had been dealing with some personal issues, including anxiety and depression, and wasn't sure he’d be able to handle being around a group for that long. I completely understood his situation, as I've been there myself, and I told him it was okay if he wanted to sit this one out.

When I mentioned this to Emily, she was disappointed. She really wanted Mike to come along, believing that being in nature and around friends would help him feel better. I explained that I understood her perspective but also emphasized that Mike’s mental health was my priority, and if he wasn’t comfortable, we should respect that.

After some back and forth, Emily suggested that we give Mike a call together to see if he might change his mind. I hesitated because I didn’t want to put any pressure on him, but I agreed to support her idea. We both called Mike, and while Emily encouraged him, I could hear Mike becoming increasingly uncomfortable. In the end, he decided he really didn’t want to go, and I backed him up, reassuring him that it was perfectly fine.

Later, Emily expressed that she felt I should’ve pushed Mike more to join us, arguing that sometimes we have to encourage our friends to step outside their comfort zones. I explained that while I get where she’s coming from, I didn’t want to risk damaging our friendship with Mike or make him feel guilty about his feelings. It was a tense moment, and I felt torn between my girlfriend's desire for a fun group trip and my loyalty to my friend.

In the end, Emily decided she still wanted to go on the trip, but she was upset about the situation. I think she just wanted what she believed would be best for everyone, but I also feel that I was right in prioritizing Mike's mental health.

We wanted it to be a surprise, so we worked hard to keep it under wraps and coordinated with our family and friends. The plan was to have a big gathering at our parents' favorite restaurant, complete with decorations, a slideshow of their memories, and a special toast.

About a week before the party, my sister and I decided to tell our parents that we were planning something special for them, but we didn’t reveal the details. They were curious and excited, which only added to the fun. However, in our discussions, my sister mentioned wanting to invite one of our aunts who has a tendency to dominate family events. 

I was hesitant because I knew that if she came, she would take over the moment and make it about herself, which would derail the surprise and meaning of the event. I expressed my concerns to my sister, but she insisted that it would mean a lot to our parents to have her there.

After some back and forth, we decided to compromise: we would invite our aunt but also have a plan in place to ensure the focus remained on our parents. We agreed to talk to her beforehand and set some boundaries. 

On the day of the party, everything went smoothly at first. Our parents were genuinely surprised and touched by the effort. However, as soon as our aunt arrived, she began sharing stories from her own life, and it quickly became a struggle to redirect the conversation back to our parents.

Over the next few days, I decided to check in on her from time to time. I would stop by and see if she needed help with grocery shopping or any chores around her house. Our interactions grew more friendly, and I enjoyed hearing her stories about her life.

One day, while I was there, she mentioned that her garden was overgrown, and she missed being able to tend to it like she used to. I offered to help her with it, thinking it would be a nice way to spend an afternoon. We spent a few hours together pulling weeds and planting some flowers, and she was over the moon with joy.

So, I (27f) recently had a bit of a situation with my best friend, Sarah (28f). We've been friends for over a decade and have always been there for each other through thick and thin. We share a lot of interests, especially when it comes to movies and books, and we often have movie nights at my place.

A few weeks ago, I planned a small get-together for my birthday, inviting a few close friends, including Sarah. I wanted it to be a fun, low-key evening with good food and our favorite movies. I even put together a playlist of films that had a special meaning for us over the years.

The night of the party, I was really excited. However, Sarah arrived late and seemed off from the start. She wasn't her usual bubbly self and was preoccupied with her phone. After a while, she told me that she had just broken up with her boyfriend, which explained her mood. I immediately shifted the focus of the evening to support her, asking her if she wanted to talk about it or if she’d rather just watch some movies to distract herself.

However, as the night went on, it became clear that Sarah was not enjoying herself. She kept scrolling through her phone and barely engaged in the conversations. I even tried to get her to join in on a game we were playing, but she just sat there, looking distant.

Eventually, I pulled her aside and asked if everything was okay. That’s when she revealed that she felt really bad for missing her boyfriend, even though she knew it was for the best. I totally understood where she was coming from and assured her that it was okay to feel that way. I offered to listen if she wanted to talk more, but she just wanted to go home.

So, a few months ago, my best friend, Lisa, moved back to our hometown after living abroad for a couple of years. She didn't have a place lined up, and since I have a spare room, I offered her a temporary stay until she found her own place. We've been friends for over a decade, and I thought this would be a good way to help her out.

At first, everything went smoothly. We laughed, reminisced about our old times, and enjoyed each other’s company. However, as the weeks passed, I noticed some issues. Lisa is a bit of a free spirit, which I admire, but her lifestyle is quite different from mine. She tends to stay up late, playing music or watching shows with the volume up, while I have a 9-to-5 job and need my sleep. I tried to be understanding at first, but it began to wear me down.

Additionally, Lisa is not very tidy. I often found dishes piling up in the sink and her belongings scattered throughout the common areas. I didn’t want to come off as a nag, so I brought it up casually a couple of times, suggesting we could work together to keep the place neat. But it didn't seem to change much.

Last week, I hit a breaking point. After a particularly exhausting day at work, I came home to find the living room in disarray and loud music blaring at 11 PM. I knocked on her door and asked if she could lower the volume, explaining that I had an early morning the next day. She seemed taken aback and apologized, but the next day she was still upset and mentioned feeling like I was being too controlling.

Now I’m feeling guilty about wanting to ask her to find another place to stay. I don’t want to hurt her feelings, but I also need to prioritize my own well-being. I find myself thinking that maybe I’m being unreasonable, given that I offered her a place to stay.

It was a lovely day filled with laughter, good food, and fun games. However, there was a bit of an underlying tension because my partner's parents and my parents have very different views on a lot of social issues, particularly around politics and lifestyle choices.

During the barbecue, I noticed that my partner's younger brother, who is a college student and very passionate about his beliefs, started discussing some of these topics—primarily environmentalism and social justice. My parents, who are more conservative, seemed uncomfortable and were trying to change the subject, but it didn't work. It became a bit heated, and I could feel the tension building.

To ease the situation, I suggested we move on to a game, and thankfully, everyone agreed. We played charades, and the energy shifted back to a fun, relaxed atmosphere. At one point, I thought it would be interesting to incorporate some of the topics that had come up earlier into the game to see if it could spark a more thoughtful conversation in a lighter context. 

I made a few references to the things we had discussed, like environmental issues, but I did it in a humorous way, trying to get laughs rather than arguments. Surprisingly, that actually worked—everyone ended up laughing and sharing their thoughts without the previous tension. After the game, my parents thanked me for diffusing the situation and said they enjoyed the way I presented those topics responsibly.

In the end, I felt proud that we could all enjoy each other’s company despite our differences.

We all really enjoy each other's company, and I've always appreciated the dynamic we have. Recently, one of our friends, Alex, got a promotion at work and has been really busy. He expressed how much he missed our game nights and asked if we could change the schedule to accommodate him better.

After discussing it among ourselves, we decided to move game night to a different day, but it ended up conflicting with a regular commitment of mine. I was frustrated because I didn't want to miss out on our weekly get-togethers, but I also didn't want to be the one person holding everyone back.

I reached out to Alex privately to explain my situation and suggested that maybe we could rotate the game night schedule so everyone could participate at least some of the time. I thought it was a fair compromise, but Alex didn’t take it well. He felt that I was being selfish for not prioritizing the group, and it caused a bit of tension.

The rest of our friends were caught in the middle, trying to mediate and see both sides. I felt conflicted because I understood that Alex was excited about his new job, but at the same time, I didn’t think it was fair to rearrange everything without considering everyone’s availability.

After some back and forth, we decided to take a break from game night for a week to let everyone cool down. I feel like no one is truly an asshole in this situation; we all care about each other but have different priorities and commitments. I just want to find a way to keep our group intact while being respectful of everyone's time.",897,535,0.99,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_96584,2021-08-18 00:00:00,NAH,1658,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, my best friend and I have been inseparable since high school. We’ve always been there for each other through thick and thin. Recently, he started dating this girl, and they quickly got serious. I was happy for him, but I also noticed that he started to pull away from our friendship a bit, which made me feel a little neglected.

Last week, I threw a surprise birthday party for him, planning everything meticulously since I wanted it to be special. I invited all his close friends, including his new girlfriend, and made sure to include things he loves, like his favorite cake and games.

The party was a blast, and he was genuinely surprised and thrilled. However, during the celebration, his girlfriend began to act upset. It turned out she felt excluded because I had organized the party without consulting her, and she believed she should have had a say in it since they are now a couple. I didn’t mean to come off as dismissive; I just wanted to do something nice for him.

After she expressed her feelings to him, he seemed torn between trying to enjoy his party and comforting her. I felt horrible seeing him in that position, and I ended up apologizing to her for not including her in the planning. She accepted my apology, but the vibe of the party shifted, and I could tell he was feeling stressed.

I’m now worried that I may have overstepped and put him in an awkward situation with his girlfriend. I just wanted to celebrate him. 

AITA? 

Edit: Thanks for the feedback! I reached out to him the next day to check in. He assured me that he really appreciated the party and didn’t want me to feel bad.

I didn't mind this at first, but I started to feel overwhelmed with work and personal commitments, and I realized that I wasn’t pulling my weight at home. So, I decided to have a conversation with my partner about it.

During the discussion, I expressed my appreciation for everything they had been doing but also shared that I felt a bit guilty about not contributing as much as I should. I suggested that maybe we could come up with a more balanced chore schedule. My partner agreed and we both set aside some time to discuss it further.

However, during our conversation, it became clear that my partner felt stressed about the situation and it turned into a deeper discussion about our work commitments and how they've been affecting our relationship. We both ended up feeling a little overwhelmed, but we managed to talk things through and agreed to check in with each other more often about how we were feeling.

In the end, we created a chore chart that felt fair to both of us, and we also committed to being more open about our work stress. I think we both learned a lot from that conversation.

On the day of the gathering, Claire asked if I could bring a dessert, which I gladly agreed to. I decided to bake a chocolate cake from scratch, as it’s one of her favorites. I spent the afternoon in the kitchen making sure it was perfect. I was especially careful, knowing that Claire is a bit of a foodie and appreciates quality food.

When I arrived at the gathering, I noticed that the atmosphere was a bit tense. Claire’s boyfriend had invited a few of his friends, and they seemed to be in a different mood than the rest of us. As we were all chatting, I cut the cake and served it. Claire took a bite and complimented it, but I noticed her boyfriend's friends whispering to each other. It turned out that one of them had a gluten intolerance and was visibly upset that there was nothing else for dessert.

I felt terrible. I hadn’t been informed about any dietary restrictions, and I genuinely wanted the gathering to be enjoyable for everyone. Claire's boyfriend made a snide remark about how it was typical for some people to not think about others’ needs when bringing food. I didn’t mean to offend anyone; I just wanted to celebrate Claire.

I later talked to Claire about it, and she reassured me that she appreciated the effort and that it wasn’t my fault. She mentioned that she would have liked to communicate the dietary restrictions better. In the end, we both agreed that it was an awkward situation but not worth holding any grudges over.

A few days before the trip, my partner had a sudden family emergency that required them to stay behind. While I was disappointed, I understood that family comes first, and I didn’t want them to feel guilty about missing the trip. They encouraged me to go without them, saying it would be a nice break for me and that I should have fun.

I went on the trip and had a great time hiking with our friends. However, I felt a little guilty enjoying myself without my partner. During the trip, I took several photos and videos of our adventures and shared them in our group chat so my partner could see what we were up to.

When I returned home, my partner was upset. They felt left out and mentioned that seeing the photos made them feel bad about not being able to join us. I apologized, saying that I didn’t mean to hurt their feelings and that I was just trying to keep them in the loop. I assured them that I would have preferred them to be there.

We had a long discussion about it, and I realized that while I was trying to share the experience, I might not have considered their feelings enough. My partner expressed that they wished I had toned down the sharing, at least until they were in a better place emotionally.

Recently, Sarah has been going through a tough time. She broke up with her boyfriend, and it’s been really hard for her. She often comes to me for support, which I’m happy to give.

A few days ago, Sarah came over to talk about her feelings. We ended up having a deep conversation and she started crying. I felt really bad for her, so I hugged her and tried to comfort her. We were sitting on the couch and in that moment, I leaned in and kissed her. It was impulsive, and I didn’t think about it beforehand. After I kissed her, she pulled away and looked surprised.

I immediately apologized and explained that I didn’t mean to overstep our friendship. She said she appreciated the gesture but needed some time to think about everything, especially with her recent breakup. I totally understood and didn’t want to pressure her, so I assured her that our friendship was the most important thing to me.

Since then, we’ve both been a bit awkward around each other. I’ve given her space, but I also want to make sure she knows I’m here for her no matter what. I’ve been thinking about whether my actions were inappropriate and if I should have just stayed as her friend without crossing that line.

I spent the whole afternoon cooking, making the pasta from scratch and preparing a delicious sauce. I was excited to share it with my partner.

However, when they came home, they had a tough day at work and were pretty stressed. I enthusiastically presented the meal, but my partner looked overwhelmed. They said they appreciated the effort but were too tired to enjoy it and just wanted something simple like a sandwich.

I felt a little deflated, but I understood where they were coming from. I suggested we save the pasta for another day, and we could whip up some sandwiches instead. My partner agreed, but I realized that I had put a lot of effort into the meal and felt a bit hurt that they didn't want to enjoy it.

At that moment, I snapped and said something like, ""I go through all this trouble to make a nice dinner, and all you want is a sandwich?"" My partner looked taken aback, and we ended up having a tense conversation where we both expressed our frustrations.

One night, I reached out to her to catch up, and she mentioned she was busy planning a weekend trip with her boyfriend. I tried to be supportive, but I couldn’t help but feel a little hurt that she hadn’t even mentioned wanting to hang out or include me in any of her plans. I told her I was happy for her but felt a bit sidelined since she seemed to be prioritizing her new relationship over our friendship.

She responded by saying that she didn’t mean to make me feel that way but that she was just caught up in the excitement of her new relationship. I understood, but I also felt like she could have made more of an effort to include me. After a few back-and-forth messages, I suggested that we plan a day just for the two of us soon.

We struck up a conversation, and I learned that she had just graduated high school and was considering taking a gap year before starting college.

A week later, she came in again, and we chatted a bit more. I encouraged her to take the time she needed to figure out what she wanted to do and assured her that it was okay to explore her options.

I debated for a moment but ultimately decided to approach her. I asked her if she was of legal drinking age, and she quietly admitted that she was only 19. Concerned for her, I told her that while it was great to see her having fun, she should be careful about drinking underage, especially in a public place like that where it could lead to legal issues or trouble with her future plans.

She seemed embarrassed but appreciative of my concern. I suggested she let her friends know she wasn’t comfortable drinking and should stick to non-alcoholic options. She thanked me, and I left her to enjoy the festival with her friends.

One of my friends, who had brought the lasagna, jokingly said, “Don’t worry, we all need some plain food to balance out the fancy stuff!” I laughed it off, but I was still a bit embarrassed.

Later in the evening, I overheard someone else say, ""I always appreciate a good simple dish; not everything has to be gourmet."" This made me feel a lot better, and I realized that while my dish might not have been the star of the show, it was still enjoyed by some, including the host who specifically thanked me for bringing it.

My roommates, on the other hand, are night owls. They often stay up late watching movies or playing games, and sometimes they don’t realize how loud they’re being.

They were really understanding and apologized for not realizing it was bothering me. They said they would be more mindful of the noise and even suggested we come up with a system where I could let them know if it was getting too loud.

However, as the night went on, I noticed that Sarah seemed a bit off and wasn’t enjoying herself like the rest of us. At some point, she pulled me aside and said she felt uncomfortable because she didn't think the party matched my friend’s personality and style. She suggested I should have consulted with her more about the theme since she had a lot of experience with parties.

I was taken aback because I genuinely thought everyone was on board with the theme, and I felt like it was a fun celebration. Sarah's comments stuck with me, and I felt guilty for not involving her more in the planning process, even though everyone else seemed pleased with the outcome.

I suggested that we set specific times for him to practice, ideally when I’m out of the house or when I can use my headphones. I thought this would allow us both the freedom to pursue our interests without stepping on each other's toes.

However, Mike got upset, saying that he feels like I’m trying to control his time and that music is something he needs to do freely without restrictions. He told me that he feels like I’m not supportive of his dreams, which was never my intention. I just wanted to create an environment where we could both thrive and have our individual spaces to be creative.

So, we talked it out and agreed that I would try to schedule my painting time when he’s not practicing and that he would also be mindful of his volume during certain hours when I’m home. It felt good to communicate openly about our needs, but I still wonder if I handled the situation poorly by bringing up the need for structure. Am I the asshole for wanting to have a peaceful living environment while also encouraging Mike to follow his passion?",942,2910,0.57,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_28366,2021-10-01 00:00:00,NAH,1821,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My sister and I have always had a close relationship, but lately, we've been struggling to find common ground. She's really into fitness and has recently become quite passionate about it, even starting her own YouTube channel focused on workout tips and nutrition. I think it's great that she's pursuing something she loves, and I support her in that.

However, she keeps pushing me to join her fitness journey, which involves following her strict workout routines and meal plans. I’ve tried to explain that I appreciate her enthusiasm, but I’m not really interested in that kind of lifestyle. I prefer to stay active in my own way, like going for walks and doing yoga occasionally, but I don't want to commit to a rigorous program.

Recently, she invited me to a fitness retreat she organized, and while I appreciate the offer, I had to decline because I didn't want to feel pressured to conform to her approach. When I told her I wasn't interested, she got upset, saying I was being unsupportive and that it would be a great bonding experience for us.

I felt torn because I want to be there for her and support her passion, but I also need to stay true to myself and my own preferences. A few days later, she texted me asking if I was still not going and called me a ""fitness hater,"" which really hurt.

No one is the Asshole,"I have a friend, Sarah, who is really passionate about fitness and health. She's been working hard to get in shape for a while now, and I admire her dedication. Recently, she invited me to join her for a group workout class that she loves. I was hesitant because I'm not very active, but I wanted to support her and give it a try.

When I arrived, I quickly realized that the class was way above my fitness level. I struggled to keep up and felt embarrassed. Sarah noticed and encouraged me, but I could see that she was really into the workout and enjoying it, while I was just trying to survive. After the class, I told her that I appreciated the invite, but I didn’t think it was for me. I felt out of place and a bit defeated.

Sarah suggested we try another class together that was more beginner-friendly. I agreed, wanting to support her, but I also made it clear that I didn't want to feel pressured to go if I wasn’t comfortable. She said she understood, but I could tell she was a bit disappointed. I felt bad because I didn't want to ruin her excitement about fitness.

A week later, I texted her to see how she was doing and mentioned that I might want to try the beginner class after all. She seemed really happy about it, but I also sensed a bit of hesitation on her part. I wanted to make sure she knew that I was genuinely interested in joining her, but I didn't want her to feel like she had to change her workout routine for me.

It’s been a bit awkward since then. I’m worried that I might have hurt her feelings by not being as enthusiastic about the first class. I really value our friendship and want to support her, but I also want to make sure I’m doing it in a way that feels good for both of us.

No one is the Asshole,"My best friend recently got engaged, and she asked me to be her maid of honor. I'm really excited for her, but there's a catch: she's planning a large, traditional wedding that includes a lot of cultural customs and rituals that I don't personally align with. For example, I come from a very laid-back background, and her family is quite formal and strict about these traditions.

When she asked me, I told her how honored I was but also expressed my concerns about feeling out of place during the rituals. I suggested that if she wanted someone to fully embrace those aspects, she might want to consider someone who shares those values. She was understanding but seemed disappointed, saying that my support means a lot to her regardless of my beliefs.

Now, she’s considering asking someone else, and I feel guilty. My boyfriend thinks I should just go along with it and not worry about my discomfort, but I don’t want to undermine her special day by not being fully supportive.

One of our friends, Sam, is gluten-free due to celiac disease, and we always try to accommodate him during our gatherings.

I made a big batch of nachos with all the toppings, but I inadvertently used a tortilla chip brand that contained gluten. As I was setting up the food, I realized my mistake but didn’t have time to prepare another gluten-free option before everyone arrived.

When Sam arrived, I greeted him and made a point to mention the nachos, explaining that I was really sorry but the chips weren’t gluten-free. I offered him some veggies and dip instead, which I knew were safe for him to eat. He was understanding, but I could tell he felt a bit disappointed.

As the night went on, I noticed that my other friends were enjoying the nachos. I felt guilty that Sam couldn't partake, and I wished I could have provided something better for him. After the game night, I talked to my partner about it, and they suggested I should have prepared a separate dish for Sam or at least double-checked the chips before making them.

I agreed that I could have done better, but I also felt that Sam understood it was an honest mistake. I didn’t want to make him feel awkward by dwelling on it, so I didn’t bring it up again after I mentioned it initially.

We both have busy schedules, and I often find myself working late on weekdays while he has a more typical 9 to 5 job. Recently, we've been trying to prioritize our time together, and we've agreed to have a weekly date night to reconnect.

Last week, I planned a special evening for us, including dinner at his favorite restaurant and a movie afterwards. I was really looking forward to it and made sure to clear my schedule. However, on the day of our date, he called me in the afternoon to say he had a work emergency and would need to stay late to finish a project. I was disappointed but understood that work can sometimes be unpredictable.

I suggested that we could still have a date night later in the week, but he said he would be too tired after work. I felt a bit let down, as I had put a lot of effort into planning our night. I didn't want to come off as upset, so I tried to be supportive and told him it was okay, although I was a bit sad.

After that, he sent me a text saying he had to go into the office for a few hours on Saturday as well. Knowing he was working a double shift, I felt compelled to offer to bring him dinner at the office. He hesitated, saying he didn't want me to go out of my way for him, which led to a discussion about how we both feel when we can't spend time together.

In the end, we both expressed our frustrations: he felt guilty for having to work late and not being able to uphold our plans, and I felt disappointed that our time together kept getting pushed aside. We agreed that it’s important to communicate and find a balance between work and our relationship. 

So, I guess my question is: Am I being unreasonable for wanting to make our time together a priority, or is it just a situation where both of us are trying to navigate our responsibilities? Are we both at fault here?",199,1520,0.76,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_67204,2024-12-16 00:00:00,NAH,1891,AITA

A few days before the potluck, a new neighbor, let’s call her Sarah, moved in nearby. She’s from another country and mentioned that she didn’t know anyone in the area yet. I thought it would be a good idea to invite her to the potluck, so I approached her and said, “Hi Sarah! We’re having a potluck dinner at the community center this Friday. You should come! It’s a great way to meet people and share food from different cultures.”

Sarah seemed hesitant and mentioned she wasn’t sure what to bring, as she wasn’t familiar with American dishes. I assured her that anything she felt comfortable making would be welcome and that it didn’t have to be fancy. I suggested she bring a dish from her culture, which could be a nice addition to the variety we usually have.

On the day of the potluck, I noticed that Sarah had brought a traditional dish from her home country, and everyone loved it! She was really happy and felt welcomed, and throughout the evening, she made connections with several other residents.

After the event, I overheard a couple of people talking about how they appreciated me inviting Sarah and how it was nice to see her participate.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I wanted to share something that happened recently with my best friend, and I’d love to get some feedback. We’re both 26 years old and have been friends since high school. 

A couple of weeks ago, we decided to have a movie night at my place. I was really excited because I hadn’t seen her in a while and wanted to make it special. I prepared a bunch of snacks and picked out some movies that I thought she’d enjoy. She arrived, and we started catching up. 

As the night went on, I noticed she seemed a bit off. She didn’t engage as much as she usually does, and I found her scrolling on her phone quite a bit. I tried to ask her if everything was okay, but she just brushed it off, saying she was tired. 

After a while, I decided to change up the vibe and suggested we watch this new comedy that I thought would lighten the mood. However, she wasn’t interested and suggested that we watch a documentary instead. I didn’t want to be dismissive, but I was really hoping for a fun, light-hearted night. I hesitated but eventually agreed to watch the documentary. 

While watching, I could see her getting more into it, and she started to open up about some personal stuff that had been on her mind, which I appreciated. I realized she was probably not in the mood for comedy because she had been feeling down about some life changes. 

At the end of the night, she thanked me for being understanding and said she appreciated that I went along with her choice. I felt a bit guilty for initially pushing for the comedy and not picking up on her mood sooner. 

I guess my question is, was I wrong for wanting to have a fun night and suggesting the comedy? Or was it okay since I ultimately supported her choice? I’d love to hear your thoughts!",307,874,0.75,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_24784,2020-04-14 00:00:00,NAH,1744,AITA

We often attended concerts and art shows together, and I considered him one of my best friends. Recently, he had been working hard on a personal project—a local art exhibit showcasing up-and-coming artists in our community. He was passionate about it and spent countless hours organizing, promoting, and curating the event.

A few weeks before the exhibit, he invited me to help him set up. I was excited to support him, but I also had a previous commitment: I had promised my cousin I would be her plus-one at a wedding that weekend, which was something I had committed to well in advance. I contemplated canceling on my cousin, but I knew I had already committed to her, and I didn’t want to let her down.

The day of the exhibit arrived, and I sent my friend a message wishing him the best and expressing my regret for not being there to help. He responded warmly, thanking me for the message and understanding my situation. However, I could sense he was disappointed, as he had hoped I would be there to celebrate his hard work.

After the event, I learned from another mutual friend that my friend had felt let down because he had really wanted my support and thought I would prioritize his event over the wedding. I felt terrible when I heard this, as I truly valued our friendship and didn’t want him to feel unimportant.

I reached out to him to apologize for not being there and explained my commitment to my cousin, assuring him that I was proud of him and would love to hear all about the exhibit. He accepted my apology, but I could tell he still felt a bit hurt.

My best friend, Jamie, and I have been close for years. We've shared everything, from our happiest moments to our biggest struggles. Recently, Jamie got engaged to her long-time boyfriend, and I couldn’t be happier for her. However, there was a twist: she asked me to be her maid of honor.

I was thrilled and accepted immediately. As we started planning the wedding, I noticed that Jamie seemed more and more stressed. She was juggling work, wedding planning, and her personal life, and I wanted to help her as much as I could. One day, she confided in me that she was feeling overwhelmed and was worried that she wasn’t planning the wedding the way she wanted.

She gratefully accepted my help, and I began tackling tasks like the guest list, decorations, and even some vendor research. I was excited to be involved and wanted to take the pressure off her.

However, as I got deeper into planning, I started making decisions without running them by Jamie first. I thought I was helping, but I soon realized that I was making choices based on my taste rather than hers. To my surprise, Jamie wasn’t thrilled when I presented her with my ideas. She expressed that I was taking too much control, and she felt like she was losing her voice in the process.

I felt terrible. I genuinely thought I was helping, but I can see how my eagerness to take initiative may have felt overbearing. We had a heartfelt conversation about it, where we both realized that we were trying to do what’s best for each other but ended up stepping on each other’s toes.

In the end, we agreed that I would step back and let her lead the planning, while still being there to support her however she needed. I apologized for overstepping and recognized that it’s her wedding and her vision that matters most.

During lunch, she mentioned that she had been feeling lonely and that having someone to talk to meant a lot to her.

One weekend, we had planned a group outing, and Jamie convinced Alex to skip it, saying she didn’t like large crowds. I was worried because this wasn’t the first time she had encouraged him to miss our gatherings. The next week, I decided to talk to Alex about my concerns. I approached it gently, explaining that I care about him and just wanted to ensure he was happy and not being influenced negatively. I mentioned a few specific instances that I thought were concerning but made it clear that I wasn’t trying to attack his relationship.

Alex listened, but he became defensive. He insisted that Jamie was great, and he felt like I was trying to control him or dictate who he should be with. I assured him that wasn’t my intention at all, but he seemed upset and said he needed some space to think. 

A few days later, I received a message from him saying he appreciated my concern but felt like I had overstepped. He said he needed to figure things out on his own and that he didn’t want our friendship to be affected by this. I felt bad because I genuinely care for him and thought I was looking out for his best interest.

Now, I’m left wondering if I crossed a line by expressing my feelings about Jamie or if I was justified in being concerned for my friend. I love Alex, and I want him to be happy, but I’m not sure if I should have said anything at all. 

So, Am I the Asshole for talking to my friend about my concerns regarding his new relationship?",516,799,0.78,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_78561,2023-05-02 00:00:00,NAH,2197,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Today, my friend called me, excited to share that she just got a promotion and is having a small celebration at her place next Saturday. She invited me, and I was thrilled for her and immediately said I'd be there. 

Later that day, I remembered that my cousin is getting married the same weekend. I had received the wedding invitation months ago and had already committed to attending. The wedding is out of town, and I was planning to drive there with my family. I realized that I hadn't told my friend about the wedding because I thought it was far enough in advance that I would be able to make both events work.

I called my friend back to explain the situation. I told her how happy I was for her and that I would love to celebrate, but I had already committed to my cousin's wedding. She was understanding but sounded disappointed, saying she was really looking forward to having me there.

I felt bad for not being able to support her on such a special day, but I couldn’t skip my cousin's wedding either. It’s a significant family event, and I wouldn’t want to let them down. I suggested we get together the following week to celebrate her promotion instead, but she seemed a bit hesitant about that.

I know both events are important, but I’m feeling torn. Am I the asshole for not being able to attend my friend’s celebration, or is it just a tough situation where no one is at fault?",362,547,0.85,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_40824,2018-07-11 00:00:00,NAH,1395,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My (16f) friend group has been planning a camping trip for the last few months. We were all really excited about it, and we were eventually able to get a cabin at a local site. We all pitched in to cover the costs, and everything was set for the trip. 

A week before we were scheduled to leave, one of my friends, Sarah (17f), called me and said she was feeling really anxious about going. She had been dealing with a lot of personal issues lately and didn’t think she could handle being away from home, especially in a new environment. She told me she was worried about feeling overwhelmed and wanted to cancel her spot, even though she had already paid.

I understood where she was coming from, but I also felt bad because I knew everyone else was really looking forward to the trip and had made plans around it. I thought it might be helpful for Sarah to talk to the group, so I suggested that we all have a phone call together. I said we could discuss how to make her feel more comfortable or if anyone had ideas that could help her cope. Sarah agreed, but I could tell she was still hesitant.

When we had the call, the other friends were supportive, but they wanted to make sure Sarah felt included and not pressured. They offered to let her back out without any hard feelings, but they also encouraged her to try joining us for at least part of the trip. Sarah ended up deciding she would skip the entire trip, which made me sad, but I respected her decision.

After the call, I felt guilty that I had brought it up in front of everyone, thinking it might have added to her anxiety. I didn’t want to put her on the spot, but I also wanted our group to be aware of her feelings. I even considered backing out myself so she wouldn’t feel left out, but everyone else was really looking forward to it.

No one is the Asshole,"Some backstory: My parents divorced when I was young, and my dad remarried a few years later. He had two more kids with my stepmom, and while I had a good relationship with them, I always felt like I was on the outside of their family unit. My dad's side of the family also made it clear that they viewed me as less important because I was from his first marriage.

I'm now 28, and my dad's family has been planning a big family reunion. They sent out invitations and really want everyone to be there, including me. However, I've been feeling a lot of anxiety about it. The idea of being in a room with my half-siblings and my dad’s extended family, who have mostly ignored me for years, is overwhelming. I haven't seen many of them in years, and the thought of being judged or sidelined again really bothers me.

I told my dad that I don't want to attend the reunion, and he was really disappointed. He said it would mean a lot to him if I could make an effort to join the family. I feel bad for letting him down, but I also think I should prioritize my mental health. I suggested that I would be open to smaller gatherings or one-on-one visits with my siblings instead, but all he can think about is this big family event.

Now my dad is saying that I’m being overly sensitive and that I should just ""get over it"" and come. My stepmom even chimed in, saying I'm ruining the spirit of the reunion by not wanting to be a part of it.

For the past month, I’ve been swamped with work and school, and I’ve been trying to keep up with our cleaning schedule and cooking meals. My friend has been coming home late most nights and hasn’t been able to help as much, which I totally understand given her busy schedule. However, it’s starting to feel like I’m taking on the bulk of the work at home.

I brought it up to her during a casual conversation, expressing my concerns and how overwhelmed I feel. I suggested that we might need to adjust our chore schedule or possibly hire a cleaner for a couple of weeks until things settle down for both of us. She seemed a bit defensive at first but then acknowledged my feelings and said she didn’t realize how much I was taking on.

We ended up having a really open conversation about how we can support each other better and ended up coming up with a new plan. I felt relieved that we could talk about it without it turning into a big fight.

No one is the Asshole,"First of all, I apologize for any mistakes in my grammar and spelling since English is not my first language.

So, I have this friend, Mia, whom I met during my freshman year of college. We quickly bonded over our shared love for art and music, and we spent countless hours discussing our favorite bands and visiting galleries together. As time went on, I noticed that Mia was really struggling with her mental health. She opened up to me about her anxiety and depression, and I did my best to support her, encouraging her to seek help and offering to go with her to therapy sessions if she wanted.

One day, while we were hanging out, Mia expressed that she felt overwhelmed by everything and was considering dropping out of college. I could see how much she was hurting, and I genuinely wanted to help. I suggested that we both take a break from our studies and do something fun together to recharge. My idea was to take a spontaneous road trip to the coast, where we could enjoy the beach and relax for a few days.

Mia seemed excited about the idea, but after thinking it over for a few days, she told me she wasn’t ready to take such a big step and wanted to focus on her mental health first. I completely understood, and I respected her decision. However, I was a bit disappointed because I really thought the trip would help her.

After that conversation, I decided to go on the trip by myself. I figured that some time away would do me good too, and I didn't want to miss out on the opportunity. When I got back, I told Mia about my trip and how much fun I had. She seemed happy for me but also expressed some guilt for not going with me. I reassured her that it was okay; I wanted her to focus on herself, and I would always be there to support her.

In the end, I felt like I made the right decision for myself, but I also worried that going on the trip might have made her feel worse about her own situation. I didn't want her to think I was abandoning her or that I was prioritizing my own needs over hers. 

So now I’m left wondering if I was inconsiderate for going on the trip despite knowing she was struggling, or if it was okay for me to take care of my own mental health as well.

A couple of days before the trip, one of my friends, Sarah (24F), who had been part of the planning, had to drop out due to a family emergency. She was really disappointed, and we all understood that family comes first.

On the day of the hike, while we were out on the trail, we started sharing pictures and videos in our group chat to keep Sarah updated on the fun. We didn’t want her to feel left out, and she had initially expressed excitement about seeing the trip through our updates. However, as we were posting, I noticed that Sarah wasn't responding much, which was unusual for her. 

Later that evening, after we returned from the hike, I received a message from her saying that seeing our posts made her really upset and reminded her that she couldn’t join us. She felt it was too much and asked us to consider her feelings before sharing things like that next time. I completely understood where she was coming from, but I also felt that we were just trying to keep her in the loop. 

I apologized for not considering her feelings more and assured her that we would be more mindful in the future. It was a tough situation because I wanted to support her but also felt we were just being friendly by sharing our experiences.

Recently, she went through a rough breakup and has been feeling down. I’ve been trying my best to support her during this time, and we’ve been spending even more time together.

One weekend, we decided to have a movie night at my place. I prepared some snacks, and we were both relaxed and enjoying the films. At one point during a particularly emotional scene, Sarah started crying. I instinctively moved to comfort her, giving her a hug. After the hug, she seemed a bit flustered but also grateful.

As the night progressed, we ended up having a deep conversation about relationships, vulnerabilities, and how we both have navigated our feelings over the years. Sarah shared a lot about her breakup, and I listened intently, offering support and advice where I could. At one point, I jokingly mentioned that if she ever needed a ""break from dating,"" I’d be open to being her temporary ""rebound"" for fun. She laughed it off, but then paused and said, “You know, that might actually not be the worst idea.”

I didn’t want to overstep any boundaries, so I clarified that I was just joking, but I could sense she was considering it. I told her that I’d always value our friendship above anything else and that it was okay for us to explore our feelings if she felt the same way. She seemed thoughtful about it but said she needed some time to think.

After that night, we continued to hang out as friends, and Sarah brought up the conversation later, saying she appreciated the openness but wasn’t ready to move into a romantic space just yet. I assured her that our friendship meant a lot to me, and I’d be here for her regardless.

Now, I find myself wondering if I may have crossed a line by suggesting even a casual “rebound” situation. I genuinely want to be a supportive friend, but I also don’t want to make her uncomfortable.

I knew from my partner that Mike had been struggling with some mental health issues, but I didn't know the extent of it.

Throughout the day, I tried to engage Mike in conversation, but he mostly kept to himself. I could see he was uncomfortable and it made me feel bad for him, so I decided to approach him during a quieter moment. I asked if he wanted to talk about anything, and he opened up about feeling overwhelmed and anxious. I listened and tried to offer some supportive words, but I could tell he was still really down.

Later on, during dinner, there was a moment when the family started sharing funny stories from the past. Mike was sitting quietly, and I thought it might help to bring him into the conversation. So, I told a lighthearted story about my own family that I thought he could relate to. Unfortunately, it seemed to fall flat, and I noticed Mike looking even more uncomfortable.

My friend, who lives in a different state, was responsible for organizing the campsite reservations and logistics.

A couple of weeks before the trip, my friend reached out to me and mentioned that some of our other friends would be bringing their dogs along. I love dogs and I’m usually okay with them being around, but I have a mild allergy that can get pretty uncomfortable. I’ve managed it in the past, but I was a little worried about how it would go with multiple dogs at the campsite, especially since I didn’t know how they’d all get along.

I decided to bring up my concern to my friend, explaining politely that while I’m excited about the trip, I was worried the presence of several dogs might trigger my allergy symptoms. I suggested that maybe we could plan for some dog-free zones or alternate activities where the dogs wouldn’t be allowed to help mitigate the situation. My friend appreciated my honesty but was hesitant, saying that a lot of the others were really looking forward to having their pets with them.

Later that night, I received a message from her saying that she felt like I was making fun of her when I shared my story, and that it brought up some insecurities about her cooking. I was surprised because I never intended to hurt her feelings, and it was just a lighthearted conversation.

I apologized to her and explained that I didn’t mean to poke fun at her, I was just sharing my own experience. She appreciated the apology but said that she still felt a bit hurt by it. 

In the end, we both agreed that it was a misunderstanding, and we decided to meet up again soon to cook together and support each other. I felt bad for making her uncomfortable, but I also think it was an innocent mix-up.

No one is the Asshole,"This happened a few months ago, and I've been contemplating it since then. I was at a friend’s wedding, which was a beautiful event. The couple is very much in love, and I was genuinely happy to celebrate their union. The reception was lively, and people were having a great time dancing and mingling.

During the evening, I noticed that the bride's younger sister, who is around 18, seemed a bit uncomfortable and was sitting away from the dance floor. I decided to check in on her. We started talking, and she mentioned that she was feeling a bit shy and overwhelmed by all the festivities. I could relate to that feeling, especially since I was shy in my own teenage years, so I tried to encourage her to join in.

I suggested we could dance together, just the two of us, to help her ease into it. She seemed to appreciate the offer, so we headed to the dance floor. As we danced, I noticed that a few people were watching us. I was just trying to make her feel comfortable, but I also realized it was a bit unusual for a 30-something person to be dancing with an 18-year-old.

After a few songs, the bride’s mother came over, and I could see she looked a bit uncomfortable. She kindly pulled me aside and explained that while she appreciated my intentions, she felt it might be more appropriate for the sister to dance with people her own age. I completely understood and apologized for making her feel awkward. I didn’t mean to overstep; I just wanted to encourage her to have fun.

We both returned to the table, and I could see the sister felt a bit embarrassed after that interaction. I felt bad because my goal had been to support her, not to create an awkward situation. The bride later told me that her sister really appreciated my effort to include her, but I couldn’t shake off the feeling that I might have overstepped.

A friend later mentioned that I might have been a bit too much for trying to help her fit in, suggesting that I should have just let her be. I’m wondering if my actions might have inadvertently made the situation more uncomfortable for her.

No one is the Asshole,"For context, my son is 10 years old and is a huge soccer fan. He’s been playing in a local community league for a couple of years now and has really developed his skills. He was particularly excited about the upcoming end-of-season tournament because his team had a good chance of winning.

Leading up to the tournament, I told him that if his team did well and made it to the finals, I would take him to a professional soccer game as a reward. He was thrilled and worked hard during practice, showing great teamwork and dedication.

The tournament day came, and his team played exceptionally well, making it all the way to the finals. However, during the final match, my son got overly competitive. In a moment of frustration, he shoved an opposing player after a foul, resulting in a red card. He was ejected from the game, and his team ended up losing in a close battle without him.

After the game, he was devastated. I sat him down and explained that while I understood how passionate he was about soccer, his actions were unacceptable. I reminded him that part of being a good athlete is maintaining sportsmanship, even in tough situations. I also told him that, as a consequence of his behavior, I wouldn’t be able to take him to the professional game we had talked about.

He was heartbroken and couldn’t understand why I was taking this opportunity away from him. I felt awful because I know how much he loves soccer, but I also wanted to teach him an important lesson about respect and accountability.

I assured him that we could discuss going to a future game if he learns from this experience and demonstrates good sportsmanship moving forward. He agreed, but we both felt sad about the situation.

We’ve lived next to each other for about two years and, while we’re not close friends, we’ve always been on friendly terms. He’s a nice guy but can be a bit loud, especially when he has friends over.

A few nights ago, he hosted a small gathering that got a little out of hand. It was a Saturday, so I was fine with the noise at first. However, around 2 AM, things escalated. They started yelling and playing music at a volume that was impossible to ignore. I tried to be patient, but after an hour of listening to it, I finally decided to knock on his door.

When he answered, I calmly told him that it was really late and the noise was quite disruptive. Instead of apologizing, he laughed and said, “Come on, it’s just a little fun!” This frustrated me, but I kept my cool and reiterated that I just needed them to keep it down. He finally agreed and closed the door. 

However, the noise didn’t actually lessen much. Another hour passed, and they continued to be loud. At this point, I decided to call the police. I felt bad about it, but I couldn’t sleep, and I thought that maybe a visit from them would help get the point across.

The police arrived and talked to him, which did quiet things down for a bit. However, when they left, the noise picked up again, and I could hear him and his friends making jokes about me calling the cops. I think I might have overreacted by calling the police, but I was really at my wit's end and didn’t know what else to do.

The next day, I approached him to apologize for calling the cops, explaining that I just wanted to sleep. He accepted my apology but mentioned that he felt it was a bit excessive since we could have just talked it out. I agreed but also felt like he could have been more considerate.

Now, I’m left wondering if I overstepped by involving the police, or if I was justified in doing what I felt was necessary to get some peace. AITA?",274,2078,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_72440,2022-02-21 00:00:00,NAH,1978,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My best friend and I have been really close since childhood. Recently, he started dating someone new, and we all hung out together a few times. I noticed that my friend’s new girlfriend is very different from anyone he’s dated before, and while I was initially open-minded, I started to feel a bit uneasy.

After a few outings, I began to sense that his girlfriend was quite dismissive of various interests we used to share. She would often interrupt or make snide remarks about the things my friend and I enjoyed doing together. I mentioned this to my friend in a gentle way, hoping to express my concern without coming off as judgmental. I just wanted him to be aware of how she was acting and how it might affect our friendship.

My friend was upset with me for saying anything at all. He felt that I was trying to sabotage his relationship and that I should just accept his girlfriend without question. I didn’t mean to come across as overbearing or critical; I was just trying to look out for him. I thought it was important to communicate how I felt about the changes in our dynamic.

After some back and forth, we both agreed to take a step back and reflect. I realized that while I care about my friend, he has the right to choose who he dates, and he’s happy right now. At the same time, I hope he understands that my intentions came from a place of concern, not malice.

I explained that I find strict budgeting a bit stressful and prefer to keep our finances more flexible.

They felt that a detailed budget would help us save more effectively and avoid any unexpected financial surprises.

After some back and forth, I offered a compromise: we could set up a rough budget with a general idea of how much to save each month, but leave room for flexibility in our spending. They were disappointed but agreed to try it my way for a month to see how it goes.

No one is the Asshole,"Posting anonymously for privacy reasons. This is a long one, so bear with me.

I work as a teacher at a small school and have been there for five years. The school has a tight-knit community, and the staff often works together to support each other and our students. Recently, one of my colleagues, Sarah, who has been teaching at the school for over a decade, faced some personal challenges. She was going through a tough divorce and was struggling with her mental health.

In an effort to support her, our principal suggested that we all pitch in to help lighten her load. I volunteered to take over some of her classes during this time. I genuinely wanted to help, and I figured it would only be for a few weeks.

However, as the weeks turned into months, I realized I was taking on way more than I could handle. I was teaching my own classes and covering Sarah's on top of that, which left me feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. I started to fear for my own mental health, as I was constantly stressed and not able to keep up with my own lesson plans or grading.

Eventually, I decided to have a conversation with Sarah about how I was feeling. I let her know that while I wanted to support her, I was struggling to manage the additional workload. Sarah was understandably upset and felt guilty that my willingness to help came at such a cost to me. She didn’t want to be a burden and insisted she wanted to return to teaching as soon as she could.

I spoke to our principal about the situation, and we all agreed that it was best for Sarah to take the rest of the semester off to focus on her mental health. We also worked out a plan to redistribute her classes among other teachers to lighten the load for everyone.

Now, I'm left feeling conflicted. I want to support my colleague and I care about her well-being, but I also need to prioritize my own mental health. Was I wrong to ask her to step back when she needed support? Am I the asshole for needing to set boundaries for my own well-being?",643,2297,0.86,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_30757,2019-05-05 00:00:00,NAH,2002,AITA

They seem really happy together, and I always try to be supportive of their relationship. However, I’ve noticed some patterns in their dynamic that concern me.

Recently, Jake has been feeling overwhelmed with work and personal commitments. He’s been coming to me a lot to vent about his stress. While I’m more than happy to listen and help him process things, I’ve also noticed that Sarah has been quite demanding of his time, often expecting him to drop everything to cater to her needs. There have been times when Jake has had to cancel plans with me last minute because Sarah wanted him to be with her instead.

One day, during one of our conversations, Jake mentioned that he felt guilty for wanting to set boundaries with Sarah. I encouraged him to communicate openly with her about his feelings and the need for balance in their relationship. I framed it as a way for him to maintain his mental health while still being a supportive partner. He seemed to appreciate my perspective, but I could tell he was still hesitant.

A few days later, Jake brought up the conversation he had with Sarah about needing more space and time for himself. Unfortunately, it didn’t go well. Sarah got upset and accused him of not being committed and caring enough about her needs. Afterward, Jake reached out to me, sounding frustrated and confused.

I feel torn because I want to support Jake but also want to respect his relationship. I think it’s important for both partners to express their needs, but I don’t want to overstep. I suggested he and Sarah might benefit from a relationship workshop or counseling to help them navigate this issue, but I’m not sure if that’s overstepping as well.

No one is the Asshole,"I work as a coordinator for a community center that runs various programs for different age groups. Recently, we organized a family game night, and I was in charge of overseeing the event. We wanted to create a fun and inclusive atmosphere, so we encouraged families to bring their favorite board games and snacks to share.

On the day of the event, one of the families showed up with a huge box of homemade cookies, which looked amazing. As the night went on, I noticed some other families brought store-bought snacks, and there was an overall great mix of food and games. However, about halfway through the event, one of the parents approached me and expressed that they felt uncomfortable because they had a food allergy and were worried that there wasn't a clear indication of what snacks contained allergens.

I completely understood their concern and realized I hadn’t thought to make an announcement about allergies or label the snacks. I quickly gathered the families, thanked them for their contributions, and asked if anyone could share the ingredients of their snacks, particularly the homemade items. Everyone was very understanding, and we managed to create a little “snack table” where we labeled everything.

After the event, I felt a bit guilty for not being more proactive in addressing potential food allergy concerns from the beginning. I didn’t want the allergenic parent to feel singled out or anxious during a fun night. I discussed it with my team afterward, and we all agreed to make allergy awareness a priority moving forward for future events.

So, my question is, AITA for not being more aware of food allergies during the event planning, even though I handled the situation as best as I could when it was brought to my attention?

No one is the Asshole,"I recently started a weekly game night at my house with a small group of friends. We’ve been playing board games and having a great time for the past few months. I noticed that one of my friends, Sarah, tends to show up a bit late and often leaves early, which kind of makes me feel like she isn't fully invested in our time together. 

At first, I thought maybe she had other commitments, but then she mentioned that she often just goes home to binge-watch a show after coming over.

I also mentioned that it feels a bit disheartening when I put effort into organizing these nights and she doesn't seem to enjoy it as much.

Sarah responded that she loves game night but sometimes has a hard time staying focused on games because she's tired after work. She didn't mean to offend me; it’s just how her energy levels have been lately. I felt bad for bringing it up and making her feel pressured, but I also wanted to share my feelings.

I thought it would be a nice way for them to meet each other since they’ve never met before, and my partner is really supportive of my friendships.

I completely understood her perspective and didn’t want to put her in a difficult position. I told her it was okay and that I would come solo. However, I felt a bit sad because my partner and I enjoy social events together and I wanted to share this experience with them.

So, I (28M) recently moved to a new city for work and decided to join a local community sports league to meet new people. I’ve always enjoyed playing soccer, so I signed up for a recreational team. The first few practices went great, and I started to make friends with my teammates. One of them, Alex (30M), really stood out as a natural leader and we bonded over our shared love for the game.

Last week, we had a practice scheduled on a Friday evening. I was looking forward to it, but that day I got a call from my younger sister, who was going through a tough time. She was feeling overwhelmed and needed someone to talk to, and since I’m quite close to her, I felt it was important to be there for her. I reached out to Alex to let him know I wouldn’t be able to make it to practice, explaining the situation with my sister.

On Saturday, I received a message from Alex that he felt disappointed I didn’t show up, especially because he had been counting on me to help lead the warm-up exercises as we had discussed before. He told me that he understood family comes first, but it would have been nice to at least get a heads-up earlier in the week rather than just before practice. I completely understood where he was coming from; he was trying to keep the team motivated and organized.

I felt guilty for not being there and realized I could have communicated better about my commitment to the team. However, I also felt torn because I wanted to support my sister during her time of need. I reached out to Alex to apologize for not being able to make it and explained why. He appreciated the honesty but still expressed that he felt let down.

After our conversation, I decided to make a gesture of goodwill. I invited the whole team to a friendly gathering at my place to watch a game and get to know each other better. Most of the team came, and we had a great time bonding over soccer and snacks. Alex seemed to appreciate the effort and we ended up chatting and clearing the air.

Now I'm reflecting on whether I should have prioritized practice over my sister or if Alex was right to feel disappointed. I genuinely want to be a good teammate, but I also want to be there for my family.

Recently, she started dating a guy who is significantly older than her. To be honest, I have some concerns about their relationship because I feel like he’s not a good match for her.

Sarah is really excited about the baby, but she also mentioned that she might want to bring her newborn along for the camping trip. While I completely understand her desire to include her child in our adventures, I voiced my concern. I told her that camping with a newborn could be challenging and might not be enjoyable for her or the rest of our group, especially considering the long hikes and outdoor activities we typically engage in.

Sarah got a bit defensive, saying that she would be able to handle it and that we should all support her decision to bring her baby. I want to support her, but I also don’t want the trip to be stressful for her or the rest of us if she isn’t able to enjoy it fully. I suggested that maybe this year we could plan a smaller get-together closer to home where she could feel more comfortable, and we could save the camping trip for when the baby is older.

This led to some tension among our friend group. Some agree with me, saying that it might be better to postpone the camping trip for a year or so, while others feel that we should all adapt and include Sarah and her baby this year.

She often plans big outings and events, and while I enjoy spending time with the group, I sometimes need a quiet night in to recharge.

Last week, Sarah organized a surprise birthday party for another coworker, and she insisted that everyone dress up and bring elaborate gifts.

I also realized that I was unintentionally taking up a lot of Sarah's time, as she kept glancing at the clock, seemingly trying to juggle dinner and my visit.

I sensed that my visit might be overstaying its welcome, so I decided to leave after about 20 minutes. I thanked them for letting me come in and enjoy the cookies together. As I was leaving, Sarah thanked me for the cookies but mentioned that she appreciated concise visits, especially during busy evenings with the kids. She seemed slightly overwhelmed, but I chalked it up to being a single parent.

A few days later, I bumped into Sarah in the hallway. She smiled and said hello, but I couldn't shake the feeling that my visit might not have been appreciated as much as I thought. I began to wonder if I should have kept the visit shorter or even just left the cookies at the door instead of going in.

So, I’m wondering: WIBTA if I asked Sarah if she would prefer shorter visits in the future or if I should just stick to dropping things off at the door?",616,971,0.93,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_83247,2022-02-04 00:00:00,NAH,1896,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My (28m) partner (27f) and I have been together for three years, and we recently started discussing our future together. One of the big topics has been whether we want kids and how many. I’ve always imagined having two kids, while my partner grew up in a family of three and feels strongly about wanting to have three children of her own.

We’ve had some deep conversations about this, and while I’m open to the idea of having a third child eventually, I expressed my concerns. I come from a family where my parents struggled financially, and I want to ensure that we can provide adequately for our kids without stretching ourselves too thin. 

During a recent talk, my partner mentioned how she feels that having three kids is what she truly wants, and it made me feel a bit pressured. I told her that while I understand her perspective, I think it might be better to focus on having two kids first and then see how we feel down the line. I suggested that we could revisit the idea of a third child when we have more stability and a clearer picture of our finances and lifestyle.

My partner seemed disappointed, and I could tell she was upset by my response. I didn't mean to hurt her feelings; I just want us to be prepared for the responsibilities that come with having children. We left the conversation feeling a bit distant, and I’m worried that I might have come off as dismissive of her dreams.

We're quite different in many ways; I'm more of a homebody, while Jake loves going out and meeting new people. He’s always been the life of the party, while I’m more subdued, preferring small gatherings with close friends.

Recently, Jake started dating Mia (27F), who is also very social. I was excited for him because he seemed genuinely happy. However, I noticed that when they were together, he began to change. He started cancelling our plans more frequently to go out with Mia or attend events that she wanted to go to. I understood that relationships require time and compromise, but it felt like I was losing my friend.

One evening, Jake and I had plans to watch a movie at my place. A few hours before, Jake texted me that he and Mia had gotten tickets to a concert and he couldn’t make it. I felt disappointed, but I didn’t say anything at that moment. The next day, I saw an Instagram story of them at the concert, and it hit me hard. I decided to message him and express my feelings.

I told him that I felt like I was being pushed aside since he started dating Mia, and I missed our time together. Jake was taken aback but appreciated my honesty. He apologized and explained that he didn’t realize how often he had been cancelling on me. He reassured me that he values our friendship and would make more of an effort to balance both relationships.

After our talk, we made plans for the following weekend, and it felt great to reconnect. Mia also reached out to me later, saying she understood and wanted to make sure Jake maintains his friendships. We ended up having a lovely dinner together, getting to know each other better.

TL;DR: My friend Jake became distant after starting to date Mia. I expressed my feelings about it, and it led to a productive conversation where we both acknowledged the need for balance in relationships.

One evening, I decided to make a big batch of chili because it’s easy to make and I thought it would last a few days. I made a decent amount and put it in a pot on the stove to cool before I stored it in the fridge.

Later that night, one of my roommates, Alex, came home hungry. I was in my room, but I heard him rummaging through the kitchen. I assumed he would see my chili and leave it alone since I had planned to eat it the next few days. However, when I came out to check on things, I found that Alex had taken a large portion of my chili and heated it up. He looked pretty content, but I was taken aback because I hadn’t mentioned it was mine.

I told him that I had made that chili and was planning to eat it. He apologized and said he was really hungry and didn’t realize it was all for me. I understood his situation, as we’ve all been there, but I was also frustrated since I had been looking forward to eating the leftovers. We talked it over, and I suggested that next time, if he’s ever unsure about food in the kitchen, he could just ask before digging in. He agreed that was a good idea.

In the end, we both felt a bit awkward but managed to clear things up, and I made another batch of chili a few days later so we could share. Am I the asshole for being upset that he took my food without asking?",824,2805,0.8,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_18348,2018-12-18 00:00:00,NAH,1483,AITA

No one is the Asshole,"I (28M) have been friends with Sarah (27F) for several years. Recently, she decided to take a leap and start a small business selling handmade crafts online. I was really excited for her and offered to help out however I could. She asked me to assist her with social media promotion and marketing strategies, which I was thrilled to do because I have a background in that area.

Things started off great. We would meet up a couple of times a week to brainstorm ideas and create content. However, after a few weeks, I began to notice that Sarah was getting incredibly stressed. She started to doubt her talents and would often vent to me about how she felt overwhelmed by the competition and the pressure to succeed. I tried my best to be supportive, but I noticed that she was becoming increasingly negative about her own work.

During one of our meetings, Sarah mentioned that she was considering quitting because she felt like she was failing. I encouraged her to stick with it and reminded her that every entrepreneur faces challenges. I shared my own experiences with setbacks in my career and how persistence is key. But instead of finding comfort in my words, she snapped and accused me of not understanding the pressure she was under and how I was being dismissive of her feelings. I was taken aback because I thought I was being supportive.

After that conversation, I felt hesitant to bring up business-related topics, fearing it would lead to another argument. I suggested we shift our focus to something lighter when we met, but she seemed disappointed, saying she really wanted to talk about her business. It was a confusing situation because I wanted to help her, but every time I tried, it seemed to backfire.

A few weeks later, after another tough conversation, I finally expressed my concerns about how her negativity was affecting our friendship. I told her that I genuinely cared about her and wanted to see her succeed, but I was struggling to keep up with the constant anxiety she projected. She seemed to understand and apologized for taking her stress out on me, acknowledging that she needed to find better ways to cope with her feelings.

Now we’re both working on maintaining a balance. I’m trying to be there for her without feeling overwhelmed, and she’s actively working on managing her stress in healthier ways.

Background: My partner (P) and I are planning to move in together after years of dating. We’re really excited about it, but there’s a bit of a complication with a close friend of mine (F).

F has been struggling with some mental health issues for a while. They’ve been in and out of therapy and have had a tough time keeping stable housing. Recently, F reached out and asked if they could stay with me for a few weeks while they try to get back on their feet. I genuinely want to help F, but since we’re about to move in together, I’m also concerned about how this could affect our new living situation.

After discussing it with P, we both agreed that it wouldn’t be ideal to have F stay with us right before we move in. We want to create a positive and fresh environment in our new home, and we’re worried that F’s situation might create added stress for both of us during this transition. We also talked about how this isn’t just about the space, but also about our mental readiness to dive into this new chapter without added complications.

So, I had to talk to F and let them know that I can’t have them stay with me right now. I offered to help them find other resources or temporary housing options instead, but F was really upset and felt rejected. They expressed that they thought I would be more supportive, considering our friendship. 

I feel really torn about it. I want to support my friend, but I also need to prioritize my relationship and our upcoming move. P was there during the conversation and backed me up, which made me feel a bit better, but I still worry that I hurt F in the process.

TLDR: My friend asked to stay with me while they get back on their feet, but I declined because my partner and I are about to move in together and I want to create a positive environment. I feel guilty for turning them down. Am I the asshole?

Last summer, I had the opportunity to volunteer abroad for a month. It was an incredible experience where I got to work with a local community on various projects, meet amazing people, and immerse myself in a completely different culture. Coming back home was a bit of a culture shock, and I found myself struggling to readjust to my normal routine.

Since I've returned, I’ve noticed that I feel more anxious and overwhelmed in social situations, especially in larger groups. I think part of it stems from having spent a month in a quieter environment where my responsibilities were focused and my interactions were meaningful. At home, my family often gathers for dinner or game nights, and while I love them, these events sometimes feel too noisy and chaotic for me right now.

My parents have noticed my change in behavior. They’ve been making comments like, “You’re so distant now” or “Why don’t you want to spend time with us anymore?” It makes me feel guilty, but I just need some time to decompress and find my footing again. I try to join them when I can, but I also take breaks to recharge in my room when I feel the anxiety rising.

Recently, during a family game night, I opted to sit out for a while. My mom came in and asked why I was isolating myself, and I tried to explain that I just needed a moment to breathe.

Last week, I had an important presentation for work, so I wanted to get a good night's sleep the night before. I told Jake about it and asked if he could try to keep the noise down after 10 PM. He agreed, but when that night came, I could still hear him laughing and talking loudly during his gaming session. I tried to be patient at first, but after an hour, I decided to politely knock on his door and remind him about my presentation.

Jake apologized and said he would try to keep it down, but I could still hear him. Frustrated, I ended up putting in earplugs and closing my door. Eventually, I fell asleep, but when I woke up in the morning, I was still really tired and stressed about the presentation.

Later that day, after my presentation went well, I casually mentioned to Jake that I was really tired and that I’d appreciate it if he could be more mindful of the noise in the future, especially on nights before big work days. Jake understood and said he would definitely try to keep it down. We both acknowledged our different lifestyles and agreed to communicate better in the future.

No one is the Asshole,"Good Evening Reddit,

So, I find myself in a bit of a complicated situation that I’d love some perspective on. 

A few months ago, my friend Lisa lost her father unexpectedly. They had a very close relationship, and she was understandably devastated. Lisa's father left her a small inheritance, around 10k, which she has been using to cope with the loss and cover some of her immediate expenses.

Recently, I had a small gathering at my place, and Lisa was there. During the evening, the topic of finances came up, and I mentioned how stressful it can be to manage money, especially with unexpected expenses. Lisa then brought up her inheritance and how she was using it to help herself get through this difficult time.

In an attempt to lighten the mood, I jokingly suggested that she should ""save some of that cash for a fun trip instead of just bills."" I thought it was a harmless comment, but Lisa looked upset and said something along the lines of, “You don’t understand what I’m going through.” I immediately felt terrible and apologized, realizing that the loss of her father was still fresh and that my comment was tactless.

Since then, I've been thinking about whether I was being inconsiderate or if I was just trying to be supportive but failed. I genuinely care about her and want to help, but maybe I crossed a line.

So, Reddit, was I the asshole for suggesting she should use her inheritance differently, or was it just a poorly timed joke?

No one is the Asshole,"My mom is 50 and I’m 25. We have a close relationship, and I often go to her for advice and share personal news. Recently, she started dating a man who is 30 years old. I found out about their relationship when she invited him over for dinner to meet me and my younger sister.

When he arrived, I was taken aback by the age difference. I felt uncomfortable seeing my mom with someone so much younger, especially since I had always pictured her with someone closer to her own age. During dinner, I tried to be polite, but I couldn’t help making a few comments about how strange it felt. My sister seemed to take it in stride, but I could tell my mom was a bit hurt by my reaction.

After dinner, I told my mom that I thought it was odd she was dating someone so young, and I expressed my concerns about the dynamics in their relationship. She responded that she’s an adult and knows what she wants, and that I should respect her choices. She mentioned that she didn’t feel the age gap was a big deal and that they had a lot in common.

I felt guilty after our conversation because I didn’t want to make her feel bad about her happiness, but I also felt protective of her. A few days later, I apologized to her for my comments, and we had a good talk about relationships and boundaries. We agreed to be open with each other about our feelings going forward.

No one is the Asshole,"Let me start by saying that I genuinely thought I was helping, but I might have misjudged the situation. 

A few days ago, I attended a small gathering at my friend Mia's house to celebrate her birthday. It was a casual, intimate affair with just a few close friends. During the evening, Mia's younger sister, Lily, who is in her early twenties, opened up about feeling overwhelmed with work and her relationship. She was in tears, expressing that she felt like she was at a crossroads in her life and didn’t know what to do.

I could see that Mia was visibly upset for her sister, and the mood in the room was quite somber. I’ve always been the friend who tries to lighten the mood, so I decided to share a light-hearted story from my own life about a time I felt lost but ended up finding my passion through a series of silly failures. I thought it might inspire Lily to see that it’s okay to stumble before you find your way.

As I was telling the story, I noticed that Lily's expression shifted from sadness to annoyance. By the time I finished, the room was silent, and Mia looked at me with wide eyes, clearly disapproving. Lily then snapped, saying that my experiences were not the same as hers and that she didn’t appreciate me trying to make her feel better with a joke. I was taken aback and tried to explain that I just wanted to show her that everyone goes through tough times, but it seemed to fall flat. 

Mia then chimed in, telling me that this was a serious moment for her sister and that maybe I should have just listened instead of trying to make light of it. I felt horrible and tried to apologize, but the atmosphere was already pretty tense.

Afterwards, I realized that I might have been overly eager to help and didn’t consider how my words could be perceived. I never intended to undermine Lily’s feelings, and it was a difficult learning moment for me.

I (22F) have been living with my roommate (23F) for about a year now, and we generally get along really well. We have different schedules, but we make it work. Recently, I've been cooking a lot more for myself, and I've been experimenting with new recipes.

Here’s where things got tricky: I made a big batch of a new dish I was really excited about—some kind of spicy pasta. I loved it and thought it was a hit. I had enough leftovers for a few days, so I put some in the fridge, labeled it with my name, and planned on enjoying it later in the week.

A couple of days later, I came home to find that my roommate had eaten my leftovers. I was pretty upset because I had been looking forward to that meal. I mentioned it to her, and she apologized but explained that she thought it was a community fridge and didn’t realize it was mine. 

I could tell she felt bad, but I felt like she should have checked before digging in. We talked about it, and I suggested we set some clearer boundaries around the fridge to avoid any confusion in the future. She agreed that it was a good idea. 

Things got a bit heated when I pointed out that she often takes my snacks without asking, and she countered that I sometimes leave things in the fridge for too long and she doesn't want them to go to waste. We ended up in a bit of a back-and-forth argument, and while neither of us was really being mean, I think we both felt frustrated.

In the end, we both apologized and agreed to communicate better about our food going forward, but I still feel a little hurt about the whole situation. I don’t want to hold a grudge, but I also think it’s important to have boundaries.

I wanted to be there for her, so I reached out frequently to check in and offer my support. I also suggested a small gathering of friends to help her remember the good times and to create a space for her to share her feelings.

A week before the gathering, I decided to create a memory board filled with pictures of Sarah and her dad, along with some quotes and memories from friends. I thought it would be a nice way to celebrate his life and give her something positive to focus on amidst the grief.

The day of the gathering, Sarah arrived, and I presented the memory board to her. Initially, she seemed touched, but as she started to look through it, her emotions shifted. She told me that while she appreciated the gesture, she wasn't ready to look at those memories yet and felt overwhelmed. 

I immediately apologized and took it down, trying to salvage the moment. However, she was still upset. She explained that she felt pressured to engage with the board when all she wanted was to sit quietly and process her feelings. I genuinely thought I was helping, but I could see I had crossed a line.

After our talk, I made sure to reassure her that it was okay to feel however she felt and that I would support her in whatever way she needed. We ended up having a good night, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I might have overstepped.

My friend wanted to push through and enjoy the adventure despite the potential rain, while I felt it was important to prioritize safety and comfort. In the end, we decided that my friend would go ahead and hike the trails alone while I stayed back to relax at the cabin. We agreed to meet later in the evening.

I felt a bit guilty for not joining, but I also knew I had to listen to my own feelings.

My brother came to me one day, really upset because he felt like he was losing out on fun because of the limits. I remember feeling the same way when I was younger and wanted to help him out.

We talked about her vision, and I spent a lot of time coming up with different designs, incorporating her ideas and style. After a few rounds of feedback, we landed on a design that she loved.

I told her that since I’m a professional, I usually charge for my work, and I suggested we set a fair price. I was willing to give her a family discount, but I still wanted to be compensated, as it would take considerable time and effort to finalize everything. She seemed surprised and a bit hurt, saying that she thought I would do it for free since we’re sisters.

We ended up having a long conversation where I explained that while I want to support her, I also need to value my work. She understood where I was coming from but still felt disappointed. In the end, we agreed on a smaller fee than I usually charge, which I felt was fair for both of us.

I (30F) have a younger sister, Emma (26F), who recently got engaged. She announced her engagement at a family gathering and shared her excitement about planning a wedding. Emma has always been the center of attention in our family, and while I’m genuinely happy for her, I can’t help but feel a bit overshadowed.

A few weeks after the engagement announcement, Emma called me to discuss her wedding planning. She mentioned that she wanted a small, intimate wedding with close family and friends. I thought that was lovely, but then she asked if I could help her with the planning, specifically with decorations and coordinating some aspects of the event. I agreed, hoping it would be a bonding experience.

As planning progressed, I noticed that Emma seemed to be taking the lead on everything, and I was mostly just following her lead. It became clear that she wanted a very specific vision for her wedding that didn’t quite align with my ideas. I tried to share my thoughts, but I often felt dismissed. 

One day, I suggested a different color scheme that I thought would look beautiful, and Emma snapped at me, saying she had already made up her mind. I felt hurt and frustrated, so I decided to step back and let her take the reins instead of pushing my ideas. 

When the wedding day finally arrived, I was excited to see everything come together, but I also felt a little out of place. I had helped plan a few things, but it felt very much like it was all about Emma's vision without much input from me. During the reception, Emma was glowing and surrounded by friends, while I found myself sitting at a table with some distant relatives. 

After the wedding, I talked to Emma and shared my feelings. I told her I was happy for her but felt sidelined during the planning process. She apologized and said it wasn't her intention to make me feel that way.

I told my friend that I was really happy for him but that I wouldn't be able to make it to the party because of my mental health struggles.

No one is the Asshole,"A few weeks ago, my (F28) close friend Sarah (27) invited me to her engagement party. Sarah and her fiancé, Tom (30), are both great people, but their families have very different vibes. Sarah’s family is more traditional and conservative, while my family is laid-back and loves to joke around.

The engagement party was hosted in Sarah’s backyard, and everything was beautifully decorated. There was delicious food, a lovely cake, and plenty of drinks. As the party went on, I noticed Sarah’s great-aunt, who has a reputation for being quite prim, was sitting at a table decorated with a goofy sign that said “Engagement Party - Let the Good Times Roll!” My family would have loved that sign and would have made it the center of attention.

I decided to bring a little light-hearted fun to the party. I had a small rubber chicken that I often use as a gag gift, and I thought it would be funny to put it in the middle of the food table as a kind of ""party mascot."" I figured it would get a laugh from Sarah and the younger relatives, and I’d discreetly remove it if anyone seemed upset.

As soon as I placed the rubber chicken on the table, there were a few chuckles from the younger crowd, and Sarah laughed, saying, “Only you would bring that!” However, almost immediately, I saw Sarah’s great-aunt raise an eyebrow. She looked quite disapproving, and I could sense the tension in the air.

Not wanting to ruin the fun, I quickly tried to diffuse the situation by making a joke about how the chicken was there to remind everyone to keep things light-hearted. But Sarah’s mom came over and kindly asked me to take the chicken away, explaining that her family prefers a more formal atmosphere, especially for such a significant occasion.

I felt embarrassed and immediately took the chicken off the table, apologizing for overstepping. I didn’t mean to offend anyone; I just wanted to inject a bit of humor into the event. The rest of the party went smoothly, but I felt a little awkward the entire time.

After the party, Sarah texted me saying she appreciated the effort to bring laughter but that she understood her family’s values were different. I really didn’t want to cause her any stress during such a joyous time. 

So, AITA for bringing a rubber chicken to my friend’s engagement party?",611,790,0.72,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_78122,2021-12-14 00:00:00,NAH,2297,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I’m in my late twenties, and I have a younger brother who is 19. He’s been really into fitness lately and has taken a keen interest in meal prepping. He’s excited about it and has been trying to eat healthier and lift weights. I’m proud of him for wanting to improve his lifestyle.

The thing is, he’s been asking me to help him out in the kitchen because he wants to learn how to cook some of his meal prep recipes. I love cooking and have a pretty well-equipped kitchen, but I also have a busy work schedule and can’t always be around to supervise while he experiments. Plus, my kitchen can get a bit chaotic when I’m cooking, and I worry he might not be as careful with the mess as I am.

One weekend, he asked if he could come over and cook a bunch of meals for the week. I hesitated because I knew I wouldn’t be home to keep an eye on things, and I didn’t want to come back to a disaster. I explained to him that while I think it’s great he wants to cook, I just can’t manage the cleanup afterward, especially since I have a small apartment and no extra help. He seemed disappointed but understood.

My parents think I should be more supportive and just let him use the kitchen. They believe that learning to cook is an important skill, and I should help him out, even if it means a little mess. I do want to encourage him, but I also need to maintain my space.

In the end, I suggested he try cooking at his place instead, where he can make a mess without worrying about me. He thought that was a good idea and said he’d start using his own kitchen. We agreed to have a cooking night together once in a while, where I can teach him some techniques without the pressure of him needing to do it all alone.

So, I don’t think either of us is in the wrong here; we both have our reasons and ultimately found a compromise that works for us.",1000,2596,0.86,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_93790,2019-10-21 00:00:00,NAH,1841,AITA

As we started working on it, I noticed that one of my colleagues, Sarah, was feeling pretty overwhelmed. She was juggling multiple responsibilities at the same time and struggling to keep up. I could see that she was stressed and was starting to fall behind on her tasks. I offered to help her out whenever she needed it, but she kept insisting that she could handle it.

As the deadline approached, I could see that she was still struggling, and I decided to step in a bit more. I suggested that we work closely together for a few days to get things sorted out. She agreed, and we spent long hours collaborating. I felt like we were making good progress, but I could also tell that she was starting to feel a bit embarrassed about needing help.

On the day before the final presentation, we had a pretty intense session, and I pushed hard to ensure we were prepared. After the meeting, Sarah thanked me for my help but also admitted that she felt a bit overshadowed by my efforts. I didn’t mean to take the spotlight; I just wanted to make sure we did well as a team.

Now, I'm feeling torn. I genuinely wanted to help her and ensure the project was a success, but I also don’t want her to feel like I was being overbearing or taking credit for her work.

I can understand their feelings because I also want our space to be comfortable and welcoming.

I suggested that we dedicate some time on weekends to tackle the cleaning together, but my partner felt overwhelmed by the idea of doing it all in one day.

I thought it might be an unnecessary expense, especially since we can both put in some effort ourselves.

We had a long discussion, and I tried to explain my concerns about spending money on organizing services when I believed we could manage it ourselves.

They argued that hiring a professional could save us time and mental energy, which would allow us to enjoy our weekends more.

She's been working really hard to save up for her own place, and I was excited to celebrate this big milestone with her. Since I know she loves plants, I decided to get her a beautiful potted succulent as a housewarming gift. I found a lovely one that was in perfect condition at a local plant shop, and I thought it would be a nice addition to her new home.

When I arrived at the party, Jess was thrilled to see me and loved the succulent. She even mentioned that she had been wanting more plants to decorate her space. However, as we were chatting, Jess's roommate, Mark, chimed in and said, ""I hope you know that succulents can be a bit tricky to care for."" I could tell he meant well, but it felt a bit condescending, especially since Jess is quite knowledgeable about plants.

I shrugged it off and said, ""Yeah, but they're relatively low-maintenance and perfect for beginners."" Jess backed me up and said she had taken care of succulents before, but Mark kept insisting that it was a bad choice for her, which made me feel a little defensive. 

Later in the evening, Jess and I were talking alone, and I mentioned that I felt Mark's comments were a bit rude. She agreed, saying that he tends to be overprotective about her choices, especially when it comes to her new apartment. We both laughed about it and moved on with the party.

I don't think I did anything wrong by giving her the plant, and I really wanted to support her new adventure. On the other hand, I could see why Mark wanted to make sure she had the right care for her plants.

I (30m) have a younger brother, Alex (25m), who has always struggled with anxiety and depression. Growing up, I tried my best to support him, but it’s been tough, especially since I moved out of our family home for work a few years ago. Recently, he’s been trying to take steps towards better mental health, including therapy and medication, which I really admire. 

A few weeks ago, he got really excited about a new hobby: painting. He spent a lot of time working on his skills, and when I visited him, he showed me some of his pieces. I was genuinely impressed, and I encouraged him to share his art online. He was hesitant at first, fearing criticism, but after some encouragement, he decided to create an Instagram account to showcase his work.

Fast forward a couple of weeks, he had been getting some attention for his art, and he seemed happier than I’d seen him in a long time. One night, he called me, clearly upset. It turned out that someone had left a nasty comment on one of his posts, and it really hit him hard. I tried to comfort him, reminding him that criticism comes with sharing your work publicly, but he was really struggling to process it.

In a moment of misguided support, I thought I’d try to defend him publicly. I responded to the comment on his post, expressing how proud I was of him and that everyone has to start somewhere. Unfortunately, my response ended up escalating the situation. The person who commented back and forth with me, and other people chimed in, creating a bit of a mess. It turned into an argument rather than a supportive conversation, and I ended up making things worse for Alex.

After seeing the fallout, I realized that my intentions, while good, didn't take into account how fragile he was feeling at that moment. Alex ended up feeling even more overwhelmed and asked me to stay out of his online life for a while. I was hurt because I wanted to help him, but I completely understood his need for space.

We talked it out later, and he told me that while he appreciated my support, he needed to learn to handle criticism on his own, and my involvement made him feel even more anxious. I apologized for not recognizing that and promised to give him the space he needed. 

In the end, I think we're in a better place. Alex is still painting, and I’m trying to be a quieter presence in his journey. It's a learning experience for both of us, and I hope to continue supporting him in a way that respects his boundaries.

On our first day, we were assigned to take care of the dogs. There was one particular dog, a nervous little rescue named Max, who seemed to bond with me instantly. He followed me around everywhere, and I could tell he was starting to trust me. My friend noticed this and commented that it was nice to see how well I connected with him.

As the weeks went by, my friend became a bit more competitive about who the dogs liked best. One day, I overheard her talking to another volunteer, saying that she felt like Max liked me more and that it made her feel left out. I genuinely didn't mean for that to happen; I just wanted to help Max feel safe and loved.

To support my friend, I suggested that we both spend some time with Max together. I hoped that this would help her feel included. However, during our joint session with Max, I noticed that he was still gravitating towards me, which seemed to upset her. 

After our time at the shelter, my friend told me she felt uncomfortable and that I was unintentionally overshadowing her efforts. I apologized and assured her that I didn’t mean to make her feel that way. We talked it through and decided to focus on the other dogs as well, to balance things out.

I tried to initiate conversation and get them involved in games, but they weren't interested. Feeling frustrated, I gently suggested that they put their phones down for a bit and enjoy the time together as a family.

My friend asked if it would be okay, and I honestly didn’t mind having her along. I thought it might be a good distraction for her and a chance for us to bond.

I took in his dog, and everything was going smoothly—until the second day when I noticed his dog seemed a bit off.

A bit of background: I [28F] have been best friends with my friend Alex [30M] for over a decade. We have always been there for each other through thick and thin. Recently, Alex's father passed away after a long illness. It was a tough time for him, and I tried my best to support him through it.

A few weeks after his father's funeral, Alex invited me over for dinner. I was nervous because I knew he was still grieving, but I wanted to be there for him. During dinner, he opened up about some of the complicated feelings he had about his father's death and the estate. He mentioned that he felt overwhelmed, and I encouraged him to talk to a therapist.

However, I made an offhand comment about how, after all the years of his dad being sick, he should focus on his own happiness now. I didn’t mean it in a dismissive way, but looking back, I realize it may have come across as me trivializing his feelings. Alex got upset and told me that this wasn’t the time and that he didn’t want to hear what I thought he should do with his life right now. I was taken aback and tried to apologize, but the conversation got heated, and he ended up asking me to leave.

I felt terrible. I genuinely want to support him, but I realize now that I might have crossed a line. I reached out to him the next day to apologize, but he hasn't responded yet, and I’m worried I may have damaged our friendship.

I understand that grieving people need space and time, and I really didn’t mean to hurt him. I feel like I should have been more sensitive to what he was going through. We’ve always had such an open and honest friendship, and I hate that I might have jeopardized that. 

So, Reddit, AITA for trying to encourage my best friend to focus on his happiness after he lost his dad, even if it came out wrong?",871,1712,0.61,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_15318,2020-08-05 00:00:00,NAH,1863,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Some context: I have a close-knit group of friends from college, and we’ve maintained our friendship over the years. One friend, Alex, has had a tumultuous relationship with another friend, Jamie. They had a pretty intense falling out a couple of years ago, and while Jamie has moved on, Alex has held onto some resentment.

Recently, I got engaged and decided to host an engagement party. I wanted everyone to be there, but I knew my group was divided due to the history between Alex and Jamie. I genuinely wanted to avoid any drama, so I talked to both of them separately before sending out invites. 

I expressed to Alex that I would love for them to be there but understood if they felt uncomfortable due to Jamie's presence. Alex was pretty clear that they wouldn’t come if Jamie was there. On the other hand, Jamie expressed excitement about attending and wanted to support me.

In the end, I made the difficult decision to uninvite Alex to avoid conflict at my engagement party. I felt terrible doing it, but I wanted the day to be joyous and drama-free. When I let Alex know, they were understandably hurt and accused me of choosing sides.

Now, I’m feeling really conflicted. I wanted to be fair to both friends, but I also wanted to celebrate without tension. I can see both sides, and I wish things didn’t have to be this way.

My partner and I have a 10-year-old daughter who has recently developed a passion for drawing and painting. She spends a lot of her free time creating art, and we want to encourage her creativity. However, she tends to leave her art supplies scattered everywhere around the house, which has become a bit of a mess. We've talked to her about cleaning up after herself, but in the heat of inspiration, she often forgets.

Recently, I got fed up with the mess and decided to implement a rule: she would need to put away her supplies after each session before moving on to something else. I thought this would help her learn responsibility and keep the house tidier. I explained the new rule to her, and while she was initially upset and felt it was unfair, I stood my ground and said it was important to keep our living space organized.

A few days later, I noticed her art supplies still scattered around, and I ended up putting them all in a box and placing it on a high shelf. I told her she could have them back once she demonstrated that she could clean up after herself. She was heartbroken and felt like I was punishing her passion. My partner supports me but also thinks I might have gone too far by taking away her supplies.

I genuinely want her to learn responsibility, but I also don’t want to stifle her creativity. Was I wrong to take her supplies away? AITA?",529,1800,0.72,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_18490,2024-10-19 00:00:00,NAH,1397,AITA

While I respect his beliefs and often try to be conscious of my own consumption, I don’t follow his lifestyle strictly and still enjoy things like takeout and occasional new clothes.

Recently, we attended a local festival together. There were a lot of food stalls offering delicious options, but I noticed my friend becoming increasingly stressed over the waste generated by the disposable containers and utensils. He was visibly upset when some vendors served food in plastic and insisted that he wouldn’t buy anything that came in non-recyclable packaging.

I wanted to enjoy the day without feeling pressured, so when I saw a vendor offering my favorite tacos in a biodegradable container, I went ahead and ordered. My friend, however, was so caught up in the waste issue that he refused to eat anything, even though there were some sustainable options available.

I tried to encourage him to enjoy the food, suggesting that he could bring his own reusable container next time, but he seemed frustrated and said he didn’t want to support any vendors that contributed to waste. I totally understand where he’s coming from, but I also felt a little bad that he was letting his principles get in the way of enjoying the festival.

Now I’m wondering if in the future, when we’re at similar events, should I just keep quiet about my choices? I don’t want to make him feel judged for his beliefs, but I also want to enjoy myself without it turning into a debate about sustainability.

I (30 M) have a close-knit group of friends from college, and we’ve maintained our friendship for over a decade. We often meet up for game nights, dinners, and the occasional weekend getaway. Recently, we decided to plan a trip to a cabin in the mountains for a long weekend, and everyone was excited.

When we started discussing finances for the trip, it became clear that one of our friends, Alex (30 M), was in a bit of a tight spot financially. He hasn’t been working as much due to some personal issues and really wanted to join us but was concerned about the costs. The cabin rental and food would be shared among everyone, and while the costs were reasonable, we all know things can add up.

To be supportive, I suggested that we could cover Alex’s share for the rental and he could contribute what he can for food and activities. This way, he could still enjoy the trip without the financial burden. Everyone else agreed and thought it was a great idea.

However, when I mentioned this to Alex, he seemed hesitant. He expressed that he didn’t want to feel like a charity case or take advantage of our generosity. He appreciated the offer but felt uncomfortable accepting it, even though he really wanted to come along. I understood his feelings, but I also knew that we wouldn’t be the same without him on this trip.

After some back and forth, I reassured Alex that it was a group decision and that we genuinely wanted him there, regardless of financial constraints. Eventually, he agreed to come along with the understanding that he would contribute in other ways, like helping with meals and planning activities.

I love the idea of a cozy little apartment in the city where we can enjoy the hustle and bustle, while my partner prefers a larger house in the suburbs with more space for potential future kids and a backyard. We both have valid points; I appreciate the convenience and vibrancy of city life, but they value the peace and safety of a suburban environment.

We decided to take a weekend to explore both options together. After visiting a few places, I noticed my partner seemed more enthusiastic about the suburban houses, while I was leaning towards the city apartments. This led to a bit of tension, as I felt like my vision wasn't being appreciated, and they felt like I wasn't considering their desire for a family-oriented space.

Eventually, we sat down and had an open conversation about our feelings and what each option meant for us. We realized that it wasn't just about the physical space, but about our future together and what we both wanted in life.

I care about him, but I find myself dreading our conversations because they drain my energy. I’ve tried to suggest positive activities we could do together, like going for a hike or watching a funny movie, in hopes of lifting his spirits.

On the day we were set to leave, my friend Emily texted me saying she was running late because her car wouldn’t start. I offered to help her and suggested she ride with me. However, she decided to wait for a mechanic instead. I completely understood her frustration, but it was hard for me not to feel a bit annoyed, as I was eager to get going and didn’t want to waste the entire day waiting for her.

When we finally arrived at the campsite, several hours behind schedule, tensions were high. Emily seemed upset, and I tried to lighten the mood by joking about how we could have already set up camp and had dinner if we hadn’t waited. I thought it was a harmless joke, but she didn’t take it well. She snapped back, saying it wasn’t my place to criticize her situation, and that I didn’t understand how stressful it was to rely on a car that keeps breaking down.

After a long, emotional conversation, my sister asked if I would consider being a surrogate for her. She explained that she and her partner had looked into surrogacy options but were facing financial hurdles, and she felt that having a close family member carry her child would be both meaningful and more affordable.

We had a conversation with our parents, where we explained our reasons, like wanting to focus on the meaningful connections and experiences instead of just the numbers. They were surprisingly supportive, but my cousin, who has a large family of her own, felt upset that her children wouldn't be invited. She has three kids, ages 4, 6, and 8. 

I understand where she's coming from, but we decided to stick to our plan of keeping the wedding child-free, except for the children in our immediate family. I reached out to her personally to explain and reassure her that it wasn’t about them, but more about creating a peaceful atmosphere for the day. 

To her credit, she took it well and understood our viewpoint after talking it through. There were no hard feelings, and we agreed to plan a family gathering later where everyone, including kids, could celebrate with us in a more relaxed setting.

In the end, we all felt respected and understood, and I think it brought our families closer. I hope this approach can inspire others facing a similar dilemma.",624,1416,0.51,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_80578,2020-11-15 00:00:00,NAH,1328,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I recently went through a tough time with my mental health. After a long period of feeling down, I finally reached out to a couple of my close friends, hoping to talk about what I was going through. I needed support, and I thought they would understand. 

When I told them about my struggles, I was met with a mix of responses. One friend was really supportive and offered to help me through it, but the other seemed uncomfortable and brushed it off, saying something like, ""Everyone goes through rough patches; you'll be fine."" I felt dismissed and hurt, especially since I had always been there for them during their tough times.

After our conversations, I ended up feeling frustrated and isolated. I decided to take a step back from both friendships because I didn't want to put energy into relationships where I felt unsupported. I’ve since started focusing on my mental health and have sought out new friendships where I feel more understood.

Now, I’m questioning whether I overreacted. Was it wrong of me to expect more empathy from my friends, or did I handle it poorly by withdrawing? AITA?",56,1383,0.82,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_40516,2021-02-14 00:00:00,NAH,1100,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, my partner and I have been living together for about a year now. We both have pets: I have a cat and they have a dog. At first, everything went smoothly as we introduced them, but as time went on, things got a bit complicated.

My cat is generally pretty chill, but the dog is very energetic and tends to chase after anything that moves. There have been a few incidents where the dog has startled my cat, leading to some tense moments around the house. I’ve tried to manage the situation by keeping my cat in a separate room when I know the dog will be overly excited, but this has caused some friction between us.

One night, my partner had some friends over, and the dog was especially hyper. I was concerned about my cat’s well-being and decided to keep her in the bedroom to avoid any stress. My partner, however, thought it was unfair to isolate my cat and suggested I should just let her be out with the group. I explained my worries and that my cat isn’t used to a lot of commotion, but they insisted that I was being overprotective.

After some back and forth, I finally agreed to let my cat out for a short while, thinking it could help her adapt. However, when she immediately went to hide under the couch due to the noise, I felt vindicated in my initial instinct to keep her away. My partner ended up getting frustrated with me for not just letting her be part of the gathering, and it turned into a small argument.

In the end, I understand where my partner was coming from; they wanted everyone, including the pets, to feel included. But I also feel strongly about my cat’s comfort and well-being. We both had valid points, and it’s been a little tense since then as we navigate the pet dynamic.

So, AITA for prioritizing my cat's comfort over what my partner wanted for the night?",791,513,0.7,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_51722,2020-05-01 00:00:00,NAH,1800,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I recently volunteered to help my neighbor, who is a single mom, with some yard work. She had fallen behind due to work and taking care of her kids, and I offered to help her out because I generally enjoy gardening. I spent a few hours one Saturday afternoon cutting the grass, pulling weeds, and planting some flowers that I had extra from my own garden. 

After I finished, she insisted on giving me some money for my time and effort, but I told her it was just a neighborly favor and that I didn’t want anything in return. However, she insisted and finally suggested taking me and my partner out for dinner as a thank-you, which I agreed to.

A couple of weeks later, she asked if I would be willing to help her again, and I said sure. This time, she asked if I could come over twice a month to help keep her yard in shape. I was happy to help but mentioned that I wouldn’t be able to do it for free every time. I suggested a small fee for my time, since it would take a few hours. She seemed taken aback and said she thought I enjoyed it and would want to keep helping her without payment.

I explained that while I do enjoy gardening, I also have my own responsibilities and hobbies that take up my time. I wanted to be fair to both of us, and I valued my time. She seemed a bit upset but said she would think about it. 

After a few days, she got back to me and said she’d be willing to pay me a reasonable rate for my help. I felt relieved that we could come to an agreement, and I was happy to continue helping her out. I think we both understood each other's perspectives, and I hope this will strengthen our neighborly relationship.

I’m just unsure if I should have offered to continue helping her for free since I had already helped her out before. Am I the asshole for wanting to be compensated for my time?",839,2152,0.53,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_60757,2023-02-03 00:00:00,NAH,1820,AITA

They invited all of our relatives and planned a barbecue in the backyard. My sister is really excited about her achievement, and my parents wanted it to be a memorable day for her.

As we started planning, my sister asked if she could invite a few of her close friends to the party. My parents were on board with this, but since the party was primarily for family, we agreed that it should be a small group of friends, just a few of them, to keep it manageable.

On the day of the party, everything was going great. The food was delicious, everyone was enjoying themselves, and my sister's friends arrived and blended in nicely with the family atmosphere. However, one of my aunt’s children, who is around my sister's age, felt a bit left out when he realized he wasn't invited. He didn't say anything during the party, but I could tell he was a little upset.

After the party, my aunt reached out to me and expressed her disappointment that her son wasn’t included in the celebration. I felt bad because I didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings, but we had decided on a small gathering for friends to keep the focus on my sister. I told my aunt that it was nothing personal and that we simply wanted to keep it intimate, but I could sense that she felt it was unfair that her son was left out.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I've been staying with my sister and her family for a few weeks while I look for a new job after moving to a different city. I love my sister and her kids, but they have a very different routine and lifestyle than I’m used to. For example, they often have family dinners that include a lot of takeout or pre-packaged meals to save time, while I typically cook fresh meals at home. 

I noticed that my sister seemed overwhelmed with work, the kids, and managing the household, so I thought it would be nice to help out by offering to cook a few dinners during my stay. I asked her if she would be okay with that, and she seemed really happy about it. I wanted to make something healthy and homemade, so I planned a few meals and went grocery shopping.

However, when I started cooking, I could see that my sister was a bit taken aback. She appreciated the effort but also mentioned that she was used to the convenience of takeout and was worried that the kids might not like my meals as much. I tried to reassure her, but when I served the first dinner, the kids were hesitant and didn’t eat much. My sister ended up ordering pizza for them anyway, which made me feel a bit awkward and like my effort was wasted.

After that, I didn’t want to impose anymore, so I stopped cooking and asked if I could just help with cleanup instead. My sister was relieved but also said she felt bad that I felt like I couldn’t help. We both ended up realizing that it was a tricky situation – I wanted to help but also didn’t want to upset her routine or make the kids uncomfortable.

In the end, I think we both learned that it’s okay to communicate our needs and expectations, and that sometimes what seems like a nice gesture can be complicated in a family environment.

No one is the Asshole,"This happened last weekend, and I’m still thinking about it. My partner and I went to a local park for a picnic with some friends. We had our two kids with us, ages 5 and 7. The weather was beautiful, and we were excited to spend some quality time outdoors.

As we were setting up our picnic, we noticed a large group of teenagers nearby who seemed to be celebrating something—maybe a birthday or just hanging out together. They were laughing and playing music, and while they were a bit loud, it didn’t really bother us at first. It was a Saturday afternoon, after all, and the park felt lively.

However, as the afternoon went on, their music got louder, and their language started to become more inappropriate. They were using a lot of profanity, and I noticed my kids were starting to look uncomfortable. I totally get that teenagers want to have fun, and I remember being that age, but I also felt like we were in a public space where families were around.

After a while, it got to a point where I could hear some really explicit lyrics, and I decided I needed to say something. I approached their group, feeling a bit awkward but determined to address the situation. I said something like, “Hey, I hope you’re all having a great time, but I have my kids here, and some of the language is a bit too much for them. Would you mind lowering the volume or switching to something less explicit?”

They were all really cool about it. They immediately turned down the music and apologized. One of them even said, “Oh man, we didn’t realize! Thanks for letting us know!” I felt relieved that they took it well, and we continued with our picnic.

My partner thought I did the right thing, but I’m wondering if I overstepped. I really didn’t want to ruin their fun, but I also wanted to protect my kids from hearing stuff they shouldn’t at their age.

Jake really loves playing board games, and I know he feels left out when we meet without him. I thought it would be nice to organize a game night on a Saturday afternoon when he’s available. I brought it up to the group, and everyone was excited about the idea. However, some of us expressed concern that it might be tough to get everyone together on a weekend due to other commitments.

After discussing it further, we settled on a date that worked for most people, and I sent out a group message to confirm. I noticed that one of our friends, Sarah, was particularly resistant, saying she didn’t think it was fair to change our usual schedule for one person. I completely understand where she’s coming from, but my intention was to include Jake and make him feel valued in our group.

I ended up saying that while I appreciated her perspective, I thought it was important to adjust our plans to accommodate everyone sometimes, especially since we all know how much Jake loves these game nights. Sarah seemed upset by this and said I was being inconsiderate of the group's usual routine.

Now, I feel torn. I want to include Jake, but I also don’t want to alienate Sarah or anyone else in our group.

Recently, we decided to throw a small dinner party at our apartment. It was meant to be a cozy gathering with just a few close friends.

The day before the party, I was in charge of the main dish, and Alex was supposed to handle appetizers and drinks. I asked Alex about what he was planning to make, and he mentioned he wanted to try a new recipe for a fancy appetizer. I was excited to hear that, as I love trying new foods.

On the day of the party, I was busy preparing the main dish when I noticed that Alex seemed a bit stressed and overwhelmed in the kitchen. I offered to help him with the appetizers, but he insisted that he had everything under control and didn’t need my help. I respected his wishes and continued with my own cooking.

As the party time approached, I noticed that Alex still hadn’t made much progress with the appetizers. I could sense he was getting anxious, so I gently suggested that we could work together to speed things up. He agreed, and we started working side by side.

However, in the midst of preparing everything, I accidentally spilled some of my sauce onto one of the appetizers. It was an honest mistake, and I immediately apologized. Alex got a bit frustrated, but I could tell he was just stressed about the party.

In the end, the dinner party went well. Our friends enjoyed the food, and we had a great time. However, after the guests left, Alex mentioned that he felt I should have been more careful in the kitchen and that my accident put unnecessary pressure on him. I understood where he was coming from, but I also felt that my offer to help was genuine and that accidents happen.

So, I’m left wondering if I was in the wrong for suggesting we work together and if my spill really was a big deal.

On the day of the gathering, I made the dish I had planned, making sure to check every ingredient twice to ensure it was safe for Sarah.

I felt awful, but it was a minor amount and I thought it might be okay since she hadn’t reacted to it before.

We hit it off while organizing an event, and we started chatting about our lives outside of volunteering.

Lisa expressed concern about Sarah spending time with a ""stranger"" and suggested she should be careful about who she opens up to, especially since she was in such a vulnerable state.

When I arrived, I noticed that the atmosphere was lively, with families catching up and sharing stories. However, as the day went on, I realized that many of my relatives were not really making an effort to talk to me. Most of them were clustered in small groups, reminiscing about old times, but they seemed to overlook me. It felt a bit isolating.

Later in the day, I overheard some of my cousins talking about how they didn’t think my lasagna was as good as Aunt Lisa's famous mac and cheese. I knew they were joking, but it still stung a bit. Instead of letting it get to me, I decided to keep to myself for a while and explore the park.

I went for a walk and found a quiet spot near a pond. While I was there, I bumped into my uncle, who was also taking a break from the crowd. We started chatting, and it turned out he felt a bit out of place too. We ended up having a really nice conversation and catching up on life.

I hadn’t considered this, as I thought he would be happy to see everyone.

However, she invited a few friends over to help her set up, and while I wanted to pitch in, I wasn’t included in those plans.

When I asked her if I could come help, she said she appreciated my enthusiasm but wanted to keep it a small group to avoid stress. I completely understand that, but it still stung a bit to be excluded. I didn’t want to push her, so I decided to respect her wishes.

The day of the gallery opening arrived, and I went to support her. I brought along some snacks and drinks, thinking it would be a nice surprise. However, when I arrived, I noticed that my sister had hired a catering service for the event, and my simple snacks seemed a bit out of place. I felt embarrassed and out of my element, but I didn’t want to make a scene, so I just quietly set my items down and mingled.

Later in the evening, my sister thanked me for coming but mentioned that the snacks were a bit unnecessary since she had already arranged for catering. I felt a bit hurt, but I understood she was just trying to communicate her vision for the event. I assured her I was happy to be there and support her, but I couldn't help but feel a bit left out and that perhaps my efforts weren’t appreciated.

After the event, I reflected on everything and felt like I may have overstepped by bringing the snacks. I genuinely wanted to contribute but didn't want to detract from her big night. Was I wrong for trying to help even though she didn’t want me involved in the planning? I just wanted to support her in my own way, but now I'm feeling unsure about my actions. Am I the asshole for wanting to be involved, or is my sister justified in wanting to keep things small and curated?",828,1167,0.86,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_54159,2022-08-13 00:00:00,NAH,2109,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been together for a few years, and one of the things we enjoy doing is cooking together. We both love trying new recipes and experimenting in the kitchen. Recently, we decided to have a ""themed dinner night"" where we would cook dishes from different countries. 

For our Italian night, I thought it would be a fun idea to make homemade pasta. I’ve seen it done on cooking shows and wanted to try it out. I got all the ingredients together, but when it came time to roll out the dough, I realized my rolling pin was missing. I searched everywhere but couldn’t find it.

Instead of stopping the cooking process, I decided to improvise. I grabbed a wine bottle from our countertop and used that to roll out the pasta. It worked surprisingly well, and I was feeling proud of my resourcefulness! 

When my partner came into the kitchen, they saw me using the wine bottle and immediately looked concerned. They asked if I thought that was sanitary and expressed worry about hygiene. I reassured them that I had cleaned the bottle thoroughly, but they still seemed uncomfortable. 

During dinner, I brought up the pasta-making experience, and my partner was still a bit unsettled by it. They said they appreciated my creativity but preferred that I had asked them first before using the wine bottle, as they thought it might not be safe. I understood their concern but explained that I didn’t want to interrupt their flow while they were setting the table.

We ended up having a good conversation about it, and I agreed that next time I would check in before making such a decision. We both realized that we have different comfort levels when it comes to improvisation in the kitchen. I think we both learned something from the experience and were able to move on without any hard feelings.",207,2456,0.94,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_71031,2022-10-23 00:00:00,NAH,1805,AITA

So, a few weeks ago, I had a small family gathering for my cousin's birthday. There were about ten of us, and we were all sitting around the table, chatting and enjoying the food. My aunt asked my cousin to share what he wanted to do when he grows up, and he excitedly talked about his dream of becoming a firefighter.

After he finished, I thought it would be fun to share my own story. I mentioned that when I was younger, I wanted to be an astronaut. I was really passionate about space and science, and I used to read every book I could find about it. But then, I went on to say that I ended up studying something completely different and never pursued that dream.

My cousin's face fell a bit when I said that, and I realized later that I might have unintentionally crushed his excitement about his own dream. He seemed a bit discouraged after I spoke, and my aunt looked at me like I shouldn’t have said anything.

A few days later, my cousin's mom (my aunt) called to mention that my cousin had been feeling a bit down about his dream after our conversation. I felt terrible! I didn't mean to discourage him; I just wanted to share my own experience.

I think I might have been a bit thoughtless in how I expressed my story. I didn't intend to rain on his parade, but now I'm wondering if I should have just kept my mouth shut.

No one is the Asshole,"I'm a 28-year-old woman, and I recently got engaged to my partner of four years. We've been planning our wedding for next summer, and I couldn't be more excited. However, there's a bit of a complication. My younger sister has been in a serious relationship for about a year, and she recently told me she's planning to get engaged soon. 

When I mentioned my wedding plans to her, she immediately asked if I could move my date to accommodate hers, as she wants us to have our weddings close together. At first, I thought she was joking, but she was completely serious. She feels it would be special for us to celebrate together, and she believes that if I change my date, it could enhance her own celebration.

I explained to her that I’ve already booked everything—venue, caterer, photographer—and that changing the date would be a huge hassle and potentially cost me more money. I also reminded her that I had been planning this for much longer than she’s been in her relationship. I offered to help her with ideas for her own wedding, suggesting that she could choose a date a few months after mine instead.

She got upset and said I was being selfish and that I should want to share this special time with her. I felt bad for her, but I also think it’s important for me to stick to my plans, especially since I’ve put in so much effort and money already. 

So now I'm just feeling confused about whether I should have been more accommodating or if it’s reasonable for me to prioritize my own wedding plans. I genuinely care about my sister and want her to be happy, but I also believe that I have every right to keep my wedding date as planned. I’m just not sure if I handled it right.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently volunteered to help organize a community event aimed at bringing people together for a weekend of fun activities, games, and food. Several local families were excited about it, and I was thrilled to see the community come together. However, right before the event, I received a message from a close friend who was going through a tough time. She was feeling very isolated and anxious, and she asked if I could come over that day to support her.

I felt torn between my commitment to the community event and my desire to be there for my friend. I decided to call her and explain the situation. I told her that I really wanted to be there for her but that I had made a commitment to help with the event. I offered to visit her after the event, and she seemed okay with that. I thought I had struck the right balance.

On the day of the event, I kept checking my phone to see if she’d reached out, but I didn't hear from her. The event went well, and many people showed up. However, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I should have prioritized my friend more. After the event ended, I finally texted her to see how she was doing. She responded saying she felt really alone that day and wished I had come by instead of doing the event.

I felt terrible. I didn’t mean to neglect her feelings, but I also wanted to support the community. I reached out to her again, apologizing and expressing that I didn't intend to hurt her. She appreciated the apology but still felt disappointed. I ended up visiting her the next day, and we had a heart-to-heart about her feelings and my commitment to the event.

In the end, we both understood each other’s perspectives. I recognized that while the community event was important, I needed to be more attuned to her needs as a friend. She also realized that I had my commitments, and it wasn’t that I didn’t care about her. We talked about how we could communicate better in the future when we both need support.

On my first day, the shelter manager introduced me to the team, and I quickly learned everyone's names. However, there was one volunteer, Alex, who I wasn't sure how to refer to because their appearance was androgynous, and I didn't want to assume anything.

During a group meeting, I was asked to share my thoughts about a new initiative. I mentioned, ""I think Alex could really contribute to this project."" After the meeting, one of the other volunteers pulled me aside and said, “Just so you know, Alex uses they/them pronouns.” I felt terrible and immediately apologized, saying I didn’t mean any disrespect.

A few days later, while working on a task, I accidentally referred to Alex as ""he"" in a conversation with another volunteer. The same volunteer gently corrected me again, and I apologized once more, feeling embarrassed. I tried to be cautious moving forward, but I could see that Alex was a bit distant and I worried I had hurt their feelings.

I later learned that Alex has been dealing with some personal issues related to their identity, and they tend to withdraw when they feel uncomfortable. I reached out to Alex, explained that I was trying to be respectful and that I was genuinely sorry for misgendering them. They appreciated the apology but mentioned that it had been a tough week for them regardless.

No one is the Asshole,"I'm one of the bridesmaids for my best friend’s wedding, and there have been a lot of opinions floating around about how things should go. The bride is super chill, but her mom has been taking charge of everything, including the bridal shower. 

Initially, I volunteered to help organize the shower and plan activities. I’m known for throwing fun events, and I was excited to contribute. However, when I started suggesting some games and themes, the bride's mom dismissed my ideas and insisted on doing everything her way. I tried to be respectful and went along with her suggestions, but I still felt a bit sidelined.

As we got closer to the shower date, I noticed that the bride was starting to look stressed. It seemed like her mom was pushing her to do things she wasn’t comfortable with. I quietly decided to have a talk with the bride to see how she felt. She admitted that she really wanted a more casual and fun vibe instead of the rigid plan her mom was enforcing. 

So, I took the initiative to suggest we take some of the games and activities I had initially proposed and modify them a bit, making it less formal and more aligned with what the bride wanted. I also made sure to keep everything under the radar from her mom so the bride wouldn’t feel pressured. 

When the day of the shower arrived, the bride had a great time, and I think the mix of my ideas with her mom's structure worked out nicely. It was a balance that kept everyone somewhat happy. I felt relieved that I could support my friend without creating conflict.

However, one of my siblings, Alex, brought along their new partner, whom I had never met before. I was excited to welcome them but didn’t realize that they had a severe gluten allergy. During dinner, I served a homemade pasta dish that I thought everyone would enjoy, not knowing about the allergy. 

When Alex’s partner discovered that they couldn’t eat the main dish, I felt awful. I apologized and offered them some side dishes that were gluten-free, but it still made the evening a bit awkward. After dinner, I tried to make it up by offering gluten-free dessert options, but the mood had already shifted.

The next day, I received a message from Alex saying that they were disappointed in me for not being more considerate of dietary restrictions, especially since they had told me about the allergy beforehand. I honestly didn’t remember that conversation, and I felt terrible that Alex's partner had to go without a proper meal. 

I tried to explain that I didn’t mean to be inconsiderate, but it didn’t seem to help; Alex was still upset. Now I’m left wondering if I should have done more to ask about dietary needs ahead of time or if it was reasonable for me to assume that everyone would enjoy the main dish without any issues.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I’m a 19-year-old college student, and I grew up in a pretty strict household. My parents are very traditional and have always emphasized the importance of family values, cultural heritage, and maintaining our family name. They’ve instilled in me a deep respect for our customs, and I’ve participated in various cultural events and gatherings throughout my life.

Recently, my younger sister (15) has been going through a lot of changes. She’s become really interested in the arts and wants to pursue a career in theater. However, my parents are less than supportive. They believe that pursuing a career in the arts is impractical and would prefer she stick to something more traditional that aligns with our family’s values, like business or law.

My sister has expressed how much her passion for acting means to her, and I can see how much joy it brings her. I decided to step in and support her. I encouraged her to audition for a local theater production, and when she got the part, I celebrated with her. I even took her out for ice cream to celebrate her accomplishment.

When I told my parents about it, they were furious. They accused me of undermining their authority and leading her astray. They argued that I should be encouraging her to focus on her studies instead of indulging her “frivolous dreams.” I tried to explain that supporting her doesn’t mean she has to abandon her studies, but they didn’t want to hear it. They think I’m encouraging her to defy their wishes and disrespect our family traditions.

Now there’s a lot of tension in our household. My sister feels more supported, but my parents are upset with both of us. I genuinely just wanted to help her follow her passion, but I’m starting to wonder if I overstepped. I feel like I’m stuck between my sister and my parents, and I’m not sure if I did the right thing.

So, a few months ago, I started volunteering at a local community center. It was a great opportunity for me to give back and meet new people. One day, while I was organizing some supplies, I met a woman named Sarah who was also volunteering. She’s incredibly talented and has a background in art therapy; we quickly bonded over our shared love for helping others.

Over the weeks, we started collaborating on a project for the kids at the center. We decided to host an art workshop, and I was really excited about it. Sarah was great at connecting with the kids, while I focused on logistics and making sure everything ran smoothly. We worked well together, and I genuinely enjoyed our time.

I wanted to support her, so I offered to take on more responsibilities for the workshop to lighten her load. She appreciated my help, but I could tell she was hesitant to accept it.

A couple of days before the event, she called me and expressed her concerns about the project. She was worried that I might take over and not let her have a say in things. I assured her that wasn’t my intention at all and that I valued her input. We had a heartfelt conversation, and I thought we cleared things up.

The workshop went really well, and the kids had a great time. However, after the event, Sarah told me she felt overshadowed by my involvement. I was shocked because I thought I was just trying to help. We had a deep discussion about it, and while we both apologized for the misunderstandings, I left feeling conflicted. 

I care about her and our friendship, but I also feel like I was genuinely trying to support her. My intention was never to overshadow her or take control. It made me wonder whether I crossed a line or if it was just a miscommunication between us.

I was initially hesitant about having someone else join us, as I was really looking forward to some quality time with my friend, but I figured it was worth it to support her brother. So, I agreed to let him come along.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I have a younger brother, Jake, who is 12. He’s been really into gaming lately, and he’s been saving up for this new console that just came out. He’s been working odd jobs, doing chores around the neighborhood, and even selling some of his old toys to gather enough cash. I think it’s great that he’s so motivated!

However, my parents have a rule about screens during the week—no gaming until the weekend. I totally support this because it helps him focus on school and other activities, and I don’t want him to get burnt out. That being said, Jake often expresses his frustration about not being able to play during the week, especially when all his friends are on and he feels like he’s missing out.

Last week, after he got a big chunk of money from a summer job, he asked if I could help him with an online purchase. At first, I thought he meant just to use my account, but then he revealed he wanted to buy the console right then and there. I explained that it wasn’t a good idea if he could only play on weekends, and that he should wait until he had saved enough to get it and his parents were okay with it. He got really upset with me, saying I was ruining his excitement and that I didn’t understand.

I didn’t mean to upset him—I just thought it was better to wait until he could enjoy it fully rather than have it sit there all week. I suggested that maybe he could talk to our parents about his feelings instead of just going through me. He didn’t want to do that, though, because he thought they would say no.

Afterward, I felt bad. I didn’t want to be the bad guy, but I also wanted him to think through his decisions. I talked to our parents about the situation, and they said they appreciated my input and that they would have a conversation with him about balancing gaming and responsibilities.

Now, I’m feeling torn. Did I handle this situation the right way, or did I end up being unreasonable? AITA for trying to help my brother think things through, or was I just being unsupportive?",449,2899,0.95,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_15766,2023-10-11 00:00:00,NAH,2011,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Last weekend, my friends and I decided to have a small barbecue at the park to celebrate the end of summer. There were about ten of us, and we all brought something to share: burgers, salads, desserts, and of course, drinks. The atmosphere was relaxed, with laughter and good food all around.

As the sun began to set, we noticed a family setting up a picnic a few yards away. They had a couple of young kids, and they seemed really excited about their outing. One of my friends, ""Mike,"" who is generally a bit loud and boisterous, started joking around and making funny faces at the kids, trying to make them laugh. At first, it was all in good fun, and the kids were giggling.

However, as the evening went on, Mike got a bit carried away. He started doing more exaggerated gestures and antics, which attracted not just the kids’ attention but also their parents. The dad of the family looked a bit uncomfortable, and the mom seemed to be trying to keep her kids focused on their picnic.

I could see the tension building, so I pulled Mike aside and suggested that maybe he tone it down a bit. I mentioned that while it was great to see the kids having fun, we didn’t want to disturb the family or make them uncomfortable. Mike was a bit offended and said he was just trying to be friendly, but he agreed to dial it back.

After that, he mostly focused on our group, and we had a great time without any further incident. The family packed up not long after, and we could see the parents whispering to each other as they left. I felt a bit bad that they may have been bothered by Mike's antics, but I also understood that he wasn’t trying to be disruptive.

So my question is: AITA for telling my friend to stop joking around with the kids? I just wanted to ensure everyone enjoyed their time, but I also didn’t want to come off as a killjoy. Everyone was having fun until Mike went a bit overboard.",224,748,0.73,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_90233,2022-04-11 00:00:00,NAH,1900,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I have a friend I’ll call ""Mike."" We’ve known each other for years and have been through a lot together. We both share a passion for music and often jam together. Recently, Mike started dating a girl named ""Sara,"" and I could tell he was really into her. They seemed to hit it off right away, and I was genuinely happy for him.

One night, Mike invited me over for a small get-together with a few friends, including Sara. We all had a great time, playing music and joking around. At one point, while we were taking a break, I decided to play a song that I thought would impress everyone. It turns out, it was one of Sara's favorite songs. She started singing along, and we ended up harmonizing together. It was a magical moment, and everyone loved it.

As the night went on, I noticed that Mike seemed a bit distant. He was still enjoying the party, but I could tell he was feeling a bit overshadowed by the connection Sara and I were having with the music. After the party, he pulled me aside and told me he felt uncomfortable with how much fun Sara and I had together. He mentioned that he was worried I was trying to steal her attention away from him.

I was taken aback because that wasn’t my intention at all. I assured Mike that I thought he and Sara were great together and that I was just having a good time. I apologized for making him feel that way, but he seemed to still be upset about it. The next day, I reached out to Sara to clarify things, and she told me that she enjoyed jamming with me but felt supported of Mike's feelings.

Both Mike and I care about each other, and I want to be supportive of his relationship. I decided to step back and not hang out with Sara alone for a while until things settle down between them. I genuinely didn’t mean to create any tension, and I just wanted everyone to have fun.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently moved into a new apartment and decided to host a small gathering to celebrate. I invited a few close friends and made sure to check with everyone about dietary restrictions since I wanted to provide a variety of snacks and drinks.

One of my friends, Sarah, has a severe nut allergy that I was cautious about. I made a point to keep all nut-containing items away from the food table and even labeled everything clearly. As the night went on, we were all having a great time, and I was glad to see everyone enjoying the food.

However, a couple of hours into the gathering, Sarah mentioned feeling unwell. I quickly checked in with her, and she revealed that she had accidentally consumed something with nuts that someone else had brought. It turned out that one of my other friends, Jake, had brought a dessert that contained nuts but hadn’t mentioned it to anyone.

I felt terrible that Sarah had to go through this, and I immediately made sure she had her medication on hand. Thankfully, she was able to manage it and didn’t need to go to the hospital. Afterward, I talked to Jake about the importance of communicating dietary restrictions, especially given the severity of Sarah's allergy.

Everyone was understanding, and Jake apologized for not being more careful. We all ended up discussing how to better handle food situations in the future, and I appreciated that there were no hard feelings. 

In the end, we all learned a valuable lesson about communication and safety, and I think it brought us closer together as friends. So, I’m wondering if I handled the situation appropriately, or if I should have done something differently.

We all had a great time together, but afterward, my roommate expressed that they felt a bit left out during the conversation.

As the party approached, I noticed Jess was getting really stressed about everything from the decorations to the food. She asked me for help, and I was more than happy to lend a hand. I offered to help with the decorations and even volunteered to bake a cake for the party.

On the day of the party, I arrived early to help set up. I brought my cake, which I thought turned out pretty well, and helped with other decorations. As people started to arrive, Jess seemed to be a bit overwhelmed. I could tell she was feeling anxious about all the attention and expectations.

During the party, Jess’s dad started to give a speech about how proud he was of her and her fiancé. In the middle of his speech, he mentioned how they had been trying to have a child for a while and were hoping to announce that news soon. 

After his speech, Jess came to me in a panic. She confided that she and her fiancé had not planned to announce anything about trying for a baby yet, and she felt caught off guard by her dad’s words. She was worried about how to respond and what everyone would think.

I tried to reassure her, telling her it was okay to just steer the conversation away from that topic if it made her uncomfortable. However, I could see she was really upset and felt embarrassed. 

Later in the evening, when things calmed down, I suggested that she could talk to her dad about it later to clarify things. Jess appreciated my support but felt bad that her dad might have unintentionally put her in that position.

So, I (25M) have a decent collection of board games that I've spent years curating. I love them, and I take good care of them because they’re not cheap and I want them to last.

My friends (also in their mid-20s) often come over, and we enjoy playing games together. However, I've noticed that they sometimes take my games out without asking me first. They’ll have game nights when I’m not around, and I’ve found pieces missing or games set up incorrectly. It’s frustrating because I’ve invested time and money into my collection, and I want to ensure they’re played correctly and kept in good condition.

Recently, I decided to have a conversation with them. I explained that while I love sharing my games, I would appreciate it if they could ask me before using them, so I can make sure everything is intact and set up properly. I thought this was a reasonable request, but some of my friends got a bit defensive, saying that it felt like I was being possessive and limiting their enjoyment.

I didn’t mean to come off that way; I just want to protect my collection and make sure everything is in order. Now I’m second-guessing if I was too harsh or if I'm overreacting.

Recently, Sarah has been dating this guy, Jake, for a few months, and they seem really happy together. However, I've noticed that Sarah has been pulling away from our friendship since she started dating him, and it's been bothering me.

Last week, I arranged a small get-together at my apartment, inviting a few mutual friends, including Sarah and Jake. I wanted to create a space where we could all hang out and catch up. When they arrived, Sarah was all over Jake, which I completely understand, but she barely acknowledged me or the other friends.

As the night went on, I tried to engage with her and include her in conversations, but she seemed more interested in being glued to Jake. At one point, I jokingly said, ""Hey Sarah, remember us little people when you become a famous couple!"" It was meant to be light-hearted, but Sarah didn’t laugh; in fact, she looked offended.

After the party, I texted her to check in and see if everything was okay. She replied that she felt I was being passive-aggressive and that I needed to respect her new relationship. I was surprised and a bit hurt because my intention was never to undermine her happiness with Jake. I just missed our friendship and was trying to bring back the good vibes we had before.

We ended up having a long conversation where I expressed how much I value our friendship and that I felt a bit neglected since she started dating Jake. She acknowledged that she might have focused too much on her relationship and agreed that we should make more time for each other.

After a bit of back and forth, I decided to sit this one out and rest at the picnic area while they went on the hike. I thought it would be better for me to relax and enjoy the scenery rather than push myself and potentially slow down the group. 

As they headed out, I could hear them having fun and laughing, and I felt a bit guilty for not joining in. When they returned a few hours later, they seemed to have a great time and I was happy for them, but I also felt a bit left out.

She was feeling really insecure about their relationship and expressed her concerns about not being ""good enough"" for him. I wanted to be supportive, so I tried to reassure her by saying that she is an amazing person and that anyone would be lucky to have her.

However, in my attempt to lighten the mood, I jokingly said something like, ""Come on, you're too great to worry about that! Besides, he might just be intimidated by how awesome you are!""

It's become a bit of a tradition, and I take pride in making it every year.

This year, my sister decided she wanted to make the turkey instead, claiming she wanted to start her own tradition and get some practice in the kitchen. While I understand her desire to branch out and create her own space within our family traditions, I felt a bit hurt and possessive over the turkey. I told her that I would prefer to keep making it since I’ve always done it, and it means a lot to me to carry on Grandma’s recipe.

She argued that I was being selfish and that I should let her make her own memories. After some back and forth, I ultimately agreed to let her make the turkey this year, but I asked if I could help out, and maybe we could do it together. She hesitated at first but eventually agreed, and we ended up having a fun time cooking together. 

The day of the gathering turned out great, and everyone loved the turkey. Afterward, my sister thanked me for letting her take the lead, saying she really enjoyed the experience. I felt relieved that we could compromise and that our family traditions could evolve rather than be a point of contention.

I genuinely enjoy spending time with him, but I don’t have kids myself, and there are times when I feel overwhelmed by the responsibility.

Recently, I noticed that Liam has started to become really attached to me. He often asks me to come over to play or to take him out for ice cream. While I love our time together, I’m starting to feel a bit pressured by the situation. I don’t want to let him down, but I also have my own life and responsibilities.

Last week, Sarah asked if I could watch Liam for an extra day because her babysitter canceled, and I reluctantly agreed, even though I had plans to relax and catch up on some personal projects. During that extra day, I felt stretched thin, trying to entertain him while balancing my own need for downtime. I ended up snapping a little when he asked to play a game I wasn’t in the mood for, and I told him I just needed a break. He looked so disappointed, and I felt terrible.

After that day, I talked to Sarah and explained how I was feeling. I told her I love spending time with Liam but that I need to set some boundaries for my own well-being. She was understanding but expressed concern about Liam’s feelings, especially since he really looks up to me.

I was frustrated and again brought it up to Alex, who apologized but didn’t seem to take it very seriously. I could see the dog was still getting rowdy, so I suggested that Alex take his dog outside for a bit to calm down. 

At first, he hesitated, saying that the dog was fine, but eventually he did take him out. However, when they came back in, the dog was still hyper and started running around the room.

I was really excited about it and started planning early, even coordinating with my parents and other siblings about what everyone could bring.

A few weeks before the dinner, my brother and his girlfriend decided they wanted to host their own Thanksgiving at their place instead. Initially, I felt a bit hurt because I had put so much effort into planning mine. I told them that I understood if they wanted to do their own thing, but I was hoping the family could still gather at my house since I had already committed to hosting.

My brother insisted that they wanted to keep things small and personal, and I could see that my feelings were starting to lead to some tension. I suggested we could combine the two gatherings, perhaps by having a big lunch at my place and then a smaller dinner at theirs later. They seemed resistant to this idea, and I didn't want to push too hard because I understood they had their own vision for the holiday.

Eventually, what we agreed on was that I would host Thanksgiving lunch, and they would host dinner. I made sure to communicate this to the rest of the family, and everyone seemed to be okay with it. However, in the end, my brother’s girlfriend went ahead and sent out invitations for their dinner to everyone in the family without discussing it with me first.

I've always been supportive of their relationship, but when it came time to discuss the wedding plans, things took a turn that left me feeling quite uncomfortable.

Sam asked if I would be a groomsman, which I happily accepted. However, as we started discussing the details, he mentioned that his fiancée wanted to have a ""themed wedding,"" focusing on their favorite TV show. I was all for creativity, but the more he explained, the more I realized it would take away from the serious nature of the commitment they were making. I expressed my concerns lightly, saying that while I think it’s great to incorporate aspects of their relationship, I felt the theme might overshadow the importance of the ceremony itself.

Sam seemed to take my comments to heart, but later he told me that his fiancée was upset because she felt I was undermining her vision. I didn't mean to make her feel that way at all, and I reached out to her to apologize. We ended up having a calm conversation where I reiterated that I support their choices and my intention was to come from a place of love and concern.

I moved here for work and, while I've made some friends, most of them are from different backgrounds and cultures. I often find myself longing for the traditions and celebrations I grew up with.

Recently, I was excited to host a cultural event at my place with some friends from my hometown who were visiting for a week. We planned a dinner featuring traditional dishes, shared stories about our childhood, and even played some music and games from back home. It felt like a warm reminder of my roots and was incredibly fulfilling.

However, my partner, who is from here, felt a bit left out. While he was supportive of the event, I noticed he seemed to be sitting on the sidelines, not really engaging with the conversations. During the dinner, I caught myself switching to our native language out of habit, which made him feel more isolated. I didn't intend to exclude him, but I got carried away in the nostalgia.

After the event, my partner expressed that while he appreciated the celebration, he felt like an outsider and wished we could have found a way to include him more. I felt guilty for not being more mindful of his feelings, even though my friends assured me that it was okay to share our culture.

In the end, we talked it over, and I realized that it was a learning experience for both of us. He understood my need to reconnect with my roots, and I learned to be more inclusive of his feelings. We decided that going forward, we could find ways to blend our cultures together more.

No one is the Asshole,"This is a throwaway account because this situation has been weighing heavily on me. I’m really struggling with how to navigate it.

A bit of background: I (29F) recently moved to a new city for a job opportunity. I didn’t know anyone here, so I decided to find a roommate to share an apartment with. I was lucky enough to meet Lisa (27F) through a mutual friend, and we hit it off. She’s fun, kind, and we’ve connected over shared interests, which has made this transition much easier for me.

However, about a month ago, Lisa’s younger brother, Mark, (23M) was involved in a serious car accident. Thankfully, he survived, but he has been in the hospital for weeks and is facing a long recovery. Lisa has been understandably devastated; she spends most of her time at the hospital with him, which I totally get. I’ve tried to support her and be there for her as much as I can.

A couple of weeks after the accident, Lisa asked if Mark could stay at our apartment for a few days once he was discharged. She explained that he would need help and a comfortable place to recuperate. I agreed, thinking it was a temporary situation, and I would do everything I could to help.

When Mark came home, he was in a lot of pain and understandably in a pretty vulnerable state. He’s been very quiet and reserved, mostly just resting. However, as the days have passed, I’ve started to feel a bit overwhelmed. Lisa is still spending most of her time at the hospital, and while I know they’re going through a tough time, Mark has been eating all the food in the house, leaving his mess everywhere, and I’ve had to adjust my schedule to accommodate his needs. 

I’ve tried to be patient and understanding, but I rarely get a moment of peace in my own home. I work remotely, and the noise from the TV and the constant interruptions have made it difficult for me to focus. I also have my own responsibilities and needs that I feel have taken a backseat.

Now, I’m at a point where I feel like I need to tell Lisa that I may need Mark to find another place to stay soon. I want to be supportive, but I also need to prioritize my well-being and mental health. I’m just unsure how to approach the conversation without coming off as insensitive or uncaring.

Would I be the asshole for wanting to ask Lisa if it’s time for Mark to move back to his own place? I really want to handle this delicately, but I also feel like I’m reaching my limit.",418,766,0.56,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_27418,2019-04-26 00:00:00,NAH,2421,AITA

We’ve been friends for over a decade, and we’ve always been there for each other through thick and thin. However, lately, I’ve noticed that he’s been making some choices that I find concerning, particularly regarding his health and relationships.

One evening, we were out for dinner, and I brought up my concerns about his drinking habits. I told him that I was worried about how much he was drinking and how it might affect his health and his job. I tried to be gentle, but he got really defensive and accused me of being judgmental and not trusting him to make his own decisions. I didn’t mean to come off that way; I was just genuinely worried about him.

Things escalated, and he ended up storming out of the restaurant, saying I’d overstepped my bounds and that I had no right to tell him how to live his life. I felt awful and tried to reach out afterward to apologize for the way the conversation turned, but he hasn’t responded to my messages.

I understand that I might have approached the topic too strongly, but I really care about him and didn’t know how else to express my concern. Now I’m left feeling like I might have lost my best friend over this. I know he’s an adult and can make his own choices, but I just wanted to look out for him.

I’m feeling conflicted. I don’t want to be the person who just sits back and watches a friend make unhealthy choices, but maybe I went about it all wrong.

No one is the Asshole,"**throwaway because my friends are on reddit. I want to share my experience without causing any further drama. I hope to be respectful in my language and intentions.**

I recently hosted a small gathering at my apartment for a few close friends to celebrate my birthday. We planned a fun night with food, drinks, and games. It was a mixed group, including a couple of friends from my college years, a few coworkers, and some neighbors I had become friendly with. 

One of my college friends, let's call him Jake, is very passionate about environmental issues and often discusses them at length. He's always trying to raise awareness and encourage sustainable living. I admire his dedication, but he can sometimes come off as a bit intense on the subject.

During the party, as we were finishing dinner, Jake started talking about climate change and how we all need to be more conscious of our carbon footprint. While I agree with him, I noticed that some guests were getting a bit uncomfortable, especially since it was a celebratory occasion. I tried to steer the conversation toward lighter topics, but Jake kept bringing it back to environmental concerns.

At one point, he made a comment about how people waste so much food on things like birthday parties, which felt a bit pointed given that we had leftover food from the meal. I could see some guests shifting uncomfortably in their seats. I didn't want to create any tension, so I kindly asked Jake if we could save the environmental discussions for another time and focus on having fun tonight.

Jake seemed taken aback and responded that he was just trying to bring awareness to important issues. I assured him that I appreciated his passion but that not everyone at the party was in the right mindset for that discussion. He seemed to understand but was clearly a bit hurt. The atmosphere shifted, and while the rest of the night was enjoyable, I felt bad that I had to shut down his enthusiasm.

After the party, Jake sent me a message thanking me for hosting but also expressed that he felt dismissed during the discussion. I apologized for making him feel that way and explained my intention was to keep the mood light for everyone. He said he understood but still felt frustrated.

I’m wondering if I was out of line for trying to redirect the conversation or if Jake was being a bit too intense for the setting. Was I the asshole for trying to keep the party light and festive, or was he for not picking up on the social cues?

One of my coworkers, Jessica, is very outgoing and loves to chat, which is great most of the time, but she also tends to dominate conversations. At first, I tried to engage and be friendly, but after a few weeks, I felt overwhelmed and found it hard to concentrate on my work. I decided that I needed to set some boundaries, so I politely told her that I needed to focus more during work hours and appreciate the quieter moments to get my tasks done.

Jessica seemed a bit hurt but understood, and I thought we had cleared the air. However, she started to share with other coworkers that I was “cold” and “unfriendly,” which wasn’t my intention at all. A few of my coworkers came to me and mentioned this, and I felt terrible because I genuinely like Jessica and didn’t want to hurt her feelings. I tried to explain my need for focus, but it felt like I was only making things worse.

No one is the Asshole,"I (28F) have a younger sister, Mia (24F), who has always been passionate about music. She’s incredibly talented and has been pursuing a career as a singer-songwriter for a few years now. Recently, she finished recording her first EP and was excited to share it with family and friends. 

In our family, we’ve always been supportive of each other's passions, but I’ve noticed that my parents tend to make a big deal out of Mia’s music, often praising her in ways that feel a bit over the top. While I’m genuinely happy for her, I sometimes feel a little overlooked since I’ve been working hard on my own career in graphic design, which is more behind-the-scenes and doesn’t get as much recognition.

When Mia invited everyone to a small release party for her EP, I felt a mix of excitement and a little resentment, knowing the focus would be entirely on her. At the party, my parents were showering her with compliments, and I couldn’t help but feel a little envious. I tried to join in the celebration, but during a toast, I accidentally made a comment about how it’s harder to get recognition in a less flashy field like mine, intending it to be light-hearted. 

Mia looked hurt, and my parents seemed uncomfortable. I quickly apologized and tried to shift the attention back to her music, but the mood felt a bit off. I later spoke to Mia privately, expressing my love for her music and my pride in her achievements, but I could tell she was still upset.

A few days later, I reached out to her to check in, and she admitted that my comment had stung. She felt like I was diminishing her accomplishments, which was not my intention at all. I told her I was sorry and that I just had a moment of insecurity. We talked it through, and I assured her that I was proud of her and always would be.

Now I’m wondering if I was wrong to have voiced my feelings at her party, even if they came out in a misguided way. It was a special moment for her, and I don’t want to be the sister who takes away from her achievements.

A few weeks ago, I finally decided to take a week off to rest and recharge. I didn’t realize how much I needed it until I started to unwind. During that week, I also had a long talk with my best friend, who I hadn’t seen in a while. She was understanding about my work situation but also expressed concern about how I’ve been neglecting my personal life and friendships.

After my break, I felt a lot more centered and ready to dive back into life. However, I started to notice that my friend wanted to hang out constantly. She invited me to several events, gatherings, and outings, but I was still in a fragile state and didn’t have the energy to keep up with everything. I tried to explain to her that while I appreciate her wanting to spend time together, I needed to pace myself.

A few days before the competition, one of our team members, Emma, who usually participates, came to me and said she was feeling really anxious about debating in front of judges. She’s a great debater, but she gets extremely nervous and sometimes freezes up. I tried to encourage her and even offered to practice with her, but she wasn’t sure she could handle the pressure.

One day, she asked me to help her create a guest list, and while we were going through names, she mentioned some friends of ours who I’ve known for years but haven’t seen in a while. I suggested a few more people that I thought would be great to invite, including some of my close friends who she knows but isn’t as close with.

I tried to talk to her about it, saying that it might be nice to have a more diverse group of people at her wedding, but she was adamant that she wanted it to be a small, intimate gathering.

No one is the Asshole,"Title: Help with family disagreement about my pet care routine...

I’m in a bit of a pickle and could use some outside perspective here. My sister and I have been at odds over my approach to caring for my dog, and I’d like to know if I’m in the wrong or if we’re just two sides of the same coin.

I have a 4-year-old Golden Retriever named Max, and I’ve always prided myself on being a responsible pet owner. I take him on long walks twice a day, engage him in mental games, and ensure he gets plenty of playtime. However, I do have a habit of leaving him outside in the backyard while I run errands or do chores inside the house. Max has a fully fenced yard, and I always check to make sure he has water and shade available. He loves being outside, watching the world go by, and I can see him from my kitchen window.

My sister, however, is adamant that this is unsafe and unfair to Max. She claims that leaving him outside, even in a secure yard, is tantamount to neglect. She argues that he should always be supervised or brought inside whenever I’m not actively playing with him. We’ve had heated discussions about it, and she’s suggested that I’m being irresponsible.

I understand her concerns, but I genuinely believe that Max enjoys his time outdoors and is safe in our yard. I always keep an eye on him from inside, and I never leave him out for an extended period—usually just long enough for me to get chores done or run quick errands.

I just want to know if my approach to Max’s care is reasonable, or if I’m indeed being dismissive of his needs as my sister suggests.

So, I’m a bit of a foodie and love trying out new recipes. I often invite friends over for dinner to showcase what I’ve been experimenting with in the kitchen. Last week, I planned a dinner for a small group of my closest friends, and I was really excited about a special dessert I had been working on: a homemade chocolate soufflé.

On the day of the dinner, my friend Kevin, who has a severe nut allergy, mentioned that he might be able to come but wasn't sure because he had eaten out earlier and was still feeling a bit off. I told him to take his time and let me know if he could make it. He eventually said he would come, but he felt it was safest to skip dessert just in case.

Cut to dinner time, and everything is going wonderfully. I decided to make the soufflé without any nuts to accommodate Kevin, but I also wanted to offer a second dessert that I knew would be safe for everyone: a fruit platter. I figured it was a nice option for those who might not want something rich.

When it came time for dessert, I served both the soufflé and the fruit platter. Kevin seemed a bit disappointed that he wouldn’t be able to try the soufflé, so I assured him it was nut-free and safe for him. He hesitated but then decided to take a small portion. I was thrilled he felt comfortable enough to try it.

However, later that evening, he started to feel a bit uneasy. He assured me it was nothing serious, but I felt terrible and started to worry that I must have missed something in the ingredients. After checking everything again, I learned that the chocolate I had used was a brand he hadn't checked before and was made in a facility that processed nuts, which technically could trigger a reaction.

Kevin was understanding and didn’t blame me directly; he just said it was a reminder to always check labels carefully. We ended up laughing it off, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I had put him in a risky situation.

He was sharing stories and making jokes, but they were often at the expense of others, including some of our friends who were visibly uncomfortable. I love my friends and want everyone to feel included and respected, so I thought it was important to say something.

During a lull in the conversation, I gently interjected and redirected the topic to something lighter, saying, ""Hey Tom, I think we’re all looking forward to hearing more about your hobbies instead! They sound interesting!"" It was an attempt to steer him away from the more hurtful jokes he had been making.

Tom didn’t take it well. He shot back, ""What, are you my mom? You don’t need to manage my conversation!"" The room went silent, and I felt really awkward. 

Sarah looked embarrassed, and I could tell she was unsure of how to handle the situation. I quickly apologized, saying, ""I didn’t mean to offend you; I just thought maybe we could all have a more fun time without the teasing."" Tom rolled his eyes but eventually dropped the subject.

Later on, as the night went on, Sarah pulled me aside and thanked me for trying to intervene. She said she appreciated me looking out for our friends since she felt uncomfortable too but didn’t know how to address it. I told her I just wanted to make sure everyone felt welcome and respected.

No one is the Asshole,"Good morning, AITA. I have a bit of a funny but also slightly awkward story involving my best friend and a karaoke night.

So, a few days ago, my friends and I decided to go out for karaoke at a local bar. It’s something we do occasionally, and it’s always a blast. My best friend, Sarah, is usually the star of the show. She has a fantastic voice and loves to take the stage.

That night, I was feeling a bit bold and decided to try singing a song I loved but had never performed in front of anyone before. It was a bit outside my comfort zone, but I thought, “Why not?” When my turn came, I was super nervous but excited. I got up there, and while I started singing, I noticed Sarah was sitting at our table, completely engrossed in her phone.

At first, I laughed it off, thinking she’d join in or at least give me some encouraging cheers. But as I continued, I couldn’t help but feel a bit hurt that my best friend wasn’t paying attention. After I finished, I walked back to our table and joked, “Thanks for the support, Sarah!” She looked up surprised and said, “Oh, sorry! I was just texting my mom. You were great!”

I realized she genuinely didn’t mean to ignore me, and I started to explain how I felt a bit let down. She immediately apologized and said she’d be more focused for the next song. We ended up having a good laugh about it, and she promised to duet with me on the next round.

I felt bad for bringing it up when I realized she wasn’t trying to be rude, but I also wanted her to know how I felt. So now I’m wondering, was I the asshole for calling her out in the moment, or was it a reasonable thing to do since we’re friends? 

Am I the asshole here?",148,2715,0.94,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_88889,2024-05-01 00:00:00,NAH,1672,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I’m a junior in high school, and I’ve been working on a big group project for my history class with three classmates. We’ve been collaborating for weeks, and we agreed to meet up at my house to finalize everything. Just a couple of days before our meeting, my older sister mentioned that our family is planning a reunion on the same day, and they really want her to bring me along since I rarely see some relatives.

I feel torn because I want to see my family and appreciate how much my sister wants to include me, but I also don’t want to let my classmates down, especially since we’ve put in so much effort into the project. I talked to my sister about how important the project is to me, and she said she understands but feels it would mean a lot to our family if I could attend. 

I decided to suggest to my group that we meet earlier in the day so I can still participate in the reunion afterward. They agreed, but I worry they might feel annoyed or that I’m not committed enough to the group. Would I be the asshole for prioritizing family time while trying to make this work, or is it reasonable to want to balance both?",563,1515,0.88,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_10413,2021-09-13 00:00:00,NAH,1128,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My best friend, Jamie, and I have known each other since elementary school. We’re both in our late 20s now. Recently, Jamie expressed interest in pursuing a career in art, something she’s always been passionate about. She asked me for my opinion on her latest piece, which I thought was a bit underwhelming compared to her usual work, but I didn’t want to discourage her.

Two weeks later, she invited me to an art show where she was showcasing her work for the first time. I was excited for her, but when I saw her piece on display, I felt it was really not her best. I noticed that it was a bit rushed and lacked the depth that I knew she was capable of. She was so proud, though, and I didn’t want to burst her bubble in front of everyone.

After the show, she asked for my honest feedback, and I hesitated. I ended up telling her that while I appreciated her creativity, I thought she could push herself a bit more in her next pieces. She seemed taken aback and said she had put a lot of effort into it. I could tell she was hurt, and I felt awful for not being more positive or supportive earlier on.

Now I’m worried that I might have come off as unsupportive or overly critical when all I wanted was to help her grow.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently started a new job at a small company, and I've been getting to know my coworkers. One of them, Sarah, is known for her baking skills and often brings in treats for the team. Last week, she brought in a batch of cookies, and they were a huge hit. I mentioned how much I enjoyed them and asked if she could share the recipe.

A few days later, she brought in a different batch of cookies, and I complimented her again. However, I noticed that other coworkers were asking for the recipe too, and Sarah seemed a bit overwhelmed by all the requests. In an attempt to lighten the mood, I jokingly suggested that she should start charging for her recipes since everyone loved them so much. I thought it would be a funny way to acknowledge her talent.

Instead of laughing it off, Sarah looked visibly upset and told me that she wasn't comfortable with that kind of joking. I immediately apologized, realizing I may have crossed a line. After that, I made sure to support her baking in a more genuine way, telling her how much I appreciate her sharing her treats without expecting anything in return.

A couple of days later, I overheard Sarah talking to another coworker about how I made her feel uncomfortable, which made me reflect on my actions. I didn't intend to hurt her feelings, but I can see how my comment could have come off the wrong way.

So, am I the asshole for trying to make a light-hearted joke that didn't land well? I genuinely respect Sarah's talent and didn't mean to offend her in any way.",464,2481,0.6,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_62516,2024-09-02 00:00:00,NAH,1516,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been living together for a couple of years now, and we both have busy jobs that often keep us occupied. Recently, my partner got a promotion at work, which means they’ll have to travel more frequently for meetings. I’ve been supportive and excited for them, but I’ve also been feeling a bit neglected since our time together is becoming limited.

With the promotion, my partner’s work has been more demanding, and I brought up the idea of scheduling a regular date night to make sure we still prioritize our relationship. My partner agreed, but they also mentioned they might need to reschedule some of our plans due to work commitments.

A couple of weeks ago, my partner had to cancel our date night because they got called into an unexpected meeting. I was disappointed but understood that it was important for their job. Instead of sulking, I decided to plan a small surprise for them to show my support, so I cooked their favorite meal and set up a cozy night in for when they returned.

When my partner came home late, they seemed exhausted and overwhelmed. I excitedly revealed the surprise, but instead of being happy, they looked stressed and said they felt bad for missing our time together. I realized that my effort to make them feel better was inadvertently putting more pressure on them.

I felt guilty for trying to create a perfect evening when they just needed to unwind. I told them I understood if they needed some space and that we could reschedule everything. They thanked me for the surprise and mentioned that they appreciated my support but were really feeling the weight of their new responsibilities.

I’ve been reflecting on whether it was wrong of me to push for a special night when I could see they were struggling. AITA for wanting to maintain our connection despite their busy schedule?",701,2257,0.58,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_60047,2021-04-19 00:00:00,NAH,1840,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I've always been a bit of a health nut, and I try to maintain a balanced diet. Recently, I started a new meal plan that focuses on whole foods and cutting out processed sugars. I was excited about it and wanted to share my journey with my family, especially my younger brother, who is only 15 and sometimes struggles with his eating habits.

Last week, I invited my brother over for dinner and decided to cook a healthy meal. I made baked chicken, steamed vegetables, and quinoa. I was hoping to inspire him to make better food choices. However, when he arrived, he looked disappointed and asked where the pizza was. I joked that pizza was off the menu, and I wanted him to try something healthier for a change.

During dinner, I noticed he was picking at his food and not enjoying it. I encouraged him to try the chicken, but he just shrugged it off, saying it wasn't what he wanted. I felt frustrated and made a comment about how he needed to learn to eat better if he wanted to feel good and have more energy for sports. He ended up getting upset and said I was being controlling about his food choices.

After he left, I felt bad that I might have pushed him too hard. I just wanted to show him that healthy food can be delicious too. The next day, I texted him to apologize for coming off as too harsh and to let him know that I support him no matter what choices he makes. He responded saying he understood where I was coming from, but he just wants to enjoy food without feeling judged.

In hindsight, I realize I might have overstepped by trying to impose my eating habits on him. I didn't mean to make him feel bad about his preferences. So, am I the asshole for trying to promote healthier eating to my brother, or was I just trying to help?",26,2586,0.88,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_61944,2022-12-07 00:00:00,NAH,1751,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been hosting a monthly game night for a group of friends for the past couple of years. It's become a cherished tradition for all of us, and everyone looks forward to it. Recently, one of our friends, Jake, started dating someone new, who I'll call Sarah. We hadn't met her yet, but Jake mentioned he wanted to bring her to game night, and we were excited to welcome her into our circle.

When Sarah arrived, she seemed shy but friendly. As the night went on, we played various games, and I noticed that Sarah wasn't really engaging with everyone. She mostly stuck close to Jake and didn't join in on the conversations or the games. I wanted her to feel included, so I made a point of asking her about her interests and hobbies, trying to draw her out.

However, as the night progressed, I could sense that she was becoming increasingly uncomfortable. At one point, I made a light-hearted joke about a game we were playing, and she seemed to take it the wrong way. Jake quickly jumped in, explaining that she had a tough day and was just a bit overwhelmed. I felt bad and immediately apologized, saying I didn't mean to make her uncomfortable.

After that, I tried to be more mindful and focused on including her in the games, but I could see she was still not really connecting with the group. At the end of the night, when everyone was leaving, I pulled Jake aside and told him that I felt like Sarah might not have had the best time. I suggested maybe we could give her some time to adjust to the group before pushing her too much.

Jake thanked me for being honest and said he would talk to her about it. I wasn't trying to be critical of Sarah; I just wanted to make sure she felt welcome and comfortable. 

Now I’m wondering if I overstepped by saying something to Jake or if I should have just let them figure it out on their own. Did I handle the situation okay, or did I come off as an asshole for bringing it up?",385,1284,0.7,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_76577,2024-11-14 00:00:00,NAH,1943,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I really need some perspective on a situation that’s been bothering me lately.

A few months ago, my friend Sarah asked me to be her maid of honor for her upcoming wedding. I was excited and honored to take on this role. Sarah has been a close friend for years, and I wanted to support her during this special time.

As the wedding planning progressed, I found out that Sarah wanted a very extravagant wedding, which included a destination venue, lavish decorations, and high-end catering. While I understood that it was her big day and she wants it to be perfect, I couldn’t help but feel a bit overwhelmed by the costs involved. Not only would I have to pay for my own travel and accommodations, but she also expected the bridal party to contribute to other expenses, like the bridal shower and bachelorette party.

I’ve recently had some unexpected expenses of my own, and it’s been tight financially. I brought this up to Sarah, explaining that while I want to support her, I might not be able to contribute as much as she hoped. I offered to help with planning and other tasks instead, but I felt bad that I couldn't provide the financial support she was looking for.

Sarah was understanding at first, but then she started to express disappointment. She said she had envisioned a certain level of support from her maid of honor, and it made me feel guilty for not being able to meet her expectations. 

I’ve been torn between wanting to be there for my friend and needing to prioritize my own financial situation. I don’t want to let Sarah down, but I also have to be realistic about what I can afford.

So, am I the asshole for wanting to step back from some of the financial obligations of being a maid of honor, or is it reasonable to prioritize my own situation while still being supportive?

No one is the Asshole,"My sister and I have always had a complicated relationship. Growing up, we were close, but as adults, we’ve drifted apart due to different lifestyles and values. She’s more spontaneous and lives a free-spirited life, while I’m more reserved and focused on stability and planning.

Recently, she invited me to a music festival that she’s been attending for years. She was really excited and wanted me to join her, insisting that it would be a great bonding experience. I thought about it but ultimately decided against it because I’m currently juggling a demanding job and taking care of my two kids. I expressed my appreciation for the invite but explained that I just couldn’t make it this year due to my responsibilities.

After I turned her down, she seemed disappointed but accepted my decision. However, a couple of weeks later, I saw online that she had posted pictures from the festival, having a blast with friends. I felt mixed emotions—happy for her, but also a little hurt that she didn’t seem to consider my feelings or find a way for us to attend together.

I decided to reach out to her, acknowledging that I felt a bit left out and wishing she had included me in her plans a bit more. She responded that she didn’t mean to hurt me, but she had a chance to go last minute and didn’t think I’d want to drop everything to join her. This led to a deeper conversation where we both shared our feelings about our relationship and how we could work on staying connected despite our differences.

In the end, we both apologized for misunderstanding each other and agreed to make more of an effort to support one another. We decided to plan a family outing together soon to reconnect.

TL;DR: My sister invited me to a festival, I declined due to responsibilities, felt hurt when I saw her enjoying it without me. We talked it out and worked on improving our relationship.",17,908,0.85,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_51312,2024-02-21 00:00:00,NAH,1878,AITA

I’m a bit of a neat freak when it comes to cooking. I always clean as I go, and I like to have everything in its place when I’m done. On the other hand, my roommate really enjoys experimenting in the kitchen, which sometimes results in a bit of a mess. She’ll leave flour everywhere, dirty dishes piled up, and sometimes even food spills that she forgets to clean up right away.

The other night, I came home from a long day at work, and the kitchen looked like a tornado had hit it. I was feeling overwhelmed and decided to have a conversation with her about it. I expressed how much the mess bothered me, especially after a long day, and asked if we could agree on cleaning up immediately after cooking. I didn’t mean to come off as harsh, but I just wanted to find a solution that works for both of us.

She got really defensive and said that cooking is her creative outlet, and she needs the freedom to make a mess while she’s working on her dishes. I understand that, but I also feel like maintaining a clean space is important for both our sanity. 

Now, we're both feeling a bit uneasy about the situation. I don’t want to stifle her creativity, but I also don’t want to constantly deal with a messy kitchen. AITA for wanting a cleaner shared kitchen space? 

EDIT: I realize I might not have been as tactful as I could have been in addressing this. I do value her cooking and creativity, and I genuinely appreciate what she brings to the table (literally).

However, things took a strange turn when she started planning her wedding. She had a very specific vision for everything, including the dress code for the bridal party.

A couple of weeks ago, she sent out a group message saying she wanted all the bridesmaids to wear matching dresses that were quite expensive and not really my style. I politely expressed that I wouldn't be able to afford that particular dress, especially since I also have some financial commitments coming up. She seemed understanding at first, but then I noticed she started to get a bit upset. She mentioned that she envisioned the day to be perfect and that matching dresses were a big part of that.

I suggested that perhaps we could find a more budget-friendly option or even allow each bridesmaid to pick a dress in the same color scheme, but she insisted on the original idea. I felt really torn because I want to support her and be there for her, but I also don’t want to go into debt over a dress I wouldn't wear again.

After thinking it through, I decided to be honest with her. I told her that while I completely understood her vision, I just couldn’t commit to that expense. She responded saying she appreciated my honesty but still seemed disappointed. 

I genuinely care about her and want her to have the wedding of her dreams, but at the same time, I have to prioritize my own financial stability. I’m worried that my decision might strain our friendship, but I also felt like I was being true to myself.

Recently, one of my friends, Sarah, went through a tough breakup. She was devastated and started leaning on our group for support, which I completely understood. We all rallied around her, offering to lend an ear or distract her with our usual activities. However, over time, Sarah began to rely solely on me for her emotional support. 

At first, I didn’t mind being there for her. I listened to her vent about her ex, her feelings of loneliness, and her struggles with anxiety. But as the weeks went on, it felt like I was the only one she turned to. She would call me multiple times a day, asking for advice and reassurance. While I care about her and want to help, I eventually started to feel overwhelmed. It became a pattern where every time I saw her name pop up on my phone, I felt a little knot of dread.

I tried to encourage her to talk to our other friends or consider seeing a therapist, but she insisted that I was the only one who truly understood her situation. I felt guilty because I didn’t want to abandon her, but I also realized I was neglecting my own needs and mental health.

After some reflection, I decided to be honest with her. I told her that while I cared for her and wanted to support her, I was starting to feel emotionally drained and that it was important for her to spread her support network beyond just me. I encouraged her to reconnect with other friends and suggested she might benefit from professional help. 

To my relief, she was understanding and appreciative of my honesty. She didn’t take it personally and agreed that she needed to reach out to others. Since then, we’ve both been working on finding a better balance in our friendship, and I feel much more at ease.

The gathering was going well, but as the night progressed, I noticed Emma was quite shy and didn't engage much with the group. I wanted to make her feel included, so I decided to start a game that required everyone to participate and share a little about themselves. I thought this would help break the ice for her.

However, as she spoke, Sam kept interrupting her, trying to add his own commentary and jokes, which seemed to fluster her. I could see she was getting uncomfortable, so I gently said, “Let her finish her story, please.” 

After I said that, Sam looked a bit offended and shot me a look. Emma eventually finished her story, and I could tell she appreciated my support. The game continued, and we had a good time. However, afterward, Sam pulled me aside and said I embarrassed him in front of Emma by calling him out. He felt I could have handled it differently, like just letting him finish his comments instead of interrupting him.

I apologized and explained that my intention was to make Emma feel comfortable and included. I also told him I didn't mean to offend him, but I felt it was important to let her speak. He seemed to soften a bit but still felt I should have approached it differently.

Recently, my neighbor had a family emergency and had to leave town unexpectedly. He asked me if I could keep an eye on his dog while he was away, which I totally understand and agreed to do without hesitation.

The thing is, I have a cat that gets really anxious around other animals. I’ve never had to deal with a dog before, and I was worried about how my cat would react. I mentioned this to my neighbor, and he said he completely understood, but he was in a tight spot. So, I agreed, thinking I could manage it for a few days.

Once his dog arrived, it turned out to be a bit more challenging than I anticipated. The dog was quite energetic and wanted to play all the time, which stressed my cat out even more. I tried my best to keep them separated and make both comfortable, but it was tough.

After a couple of days, I reached out to my neighbor to let him know how things were going and that it was a bit harder than I thought. He appreciated the update and suggested hiring a dog walker to help me out, which I agreed to.

No one is the Asshole,"I'm 28, a woman, and recently had a bit of a conflict with my best friend, Jake, who is 29. We've known each other for over a decade and have always been supportive of each other, but this situation really put a strain on our friendship.

A few weeks ago, Jake invited me to his birthday party. He was really excited about it and mentioned that he wanted it to be a big celebration with all his friends. I was looking forward to it, but then a couple of days before the party, I found out that my grandmother had passed away. This was obviously a very tough time for me, and I was heartbroken.

I talked to Jake about it and told him I wouldn't be able to make it to the party because I needed to be with my family and mourn. He understood and told me to take all the time I needed. However, the night of his party, I saw on social media that he had posted a story showing how much fun everyone was having without me. There were a lot of selfies, pictures of the food, and videos of people singing and dancing. I felt really sad seeing all of that, and it brought back the heartache of losing my grandmother.

The next day, I sent Jake a message, expressing how hurt I felt. I told him I appreciated the understanding he showed me, but seeing the party photos made me feel excluded and invisible, especially as I was dealing with grief. I didn't blame him for having fun—he should celebrate his birthday—but I just wished he had considered me a bit more.

Jake responded by saying that he didn't mean to make me feel bad and that he was just trying to share the joy of his birthday.

No one is the Asshole,"I want to share a situation that happened recently and get some outside perspective on whether I'm in the wrong here.

A little context: I’ve been friends with Sarah for years, and we’ve always been supportive of each other. Recently, she started dating Jack, who is a great guy but has a very different background and set of values than us. Sarah has been really excited about their relationship, and I've been happy for her.

However, things took a turn when I learned that Jack holds some pretty strong views that I personally find problematic. For example, he often makes jokes about mental health and seems to think that therapy is a waste of time. I’ve struggled with anxiety myself, and I know how important mental health support can be, so I felt uncomfortable hearing him talk that way.

One evening, our friend group was hanging out, and Jack started making some comments that really rubbed me the wrong way. I decided to speak up and mentioned that I thought his jokes were insensitive. I didn’t want to attack him personally, but I felt it was important to express how I felt, especially since I knew some of our friends also struggled with similar issues.

Sarah got really upset with me for speaking out. She said I was being judgmental and that Jack was just trying to be funny. I tried to explain that it wasn’t about judging Jack but rather about creating a safe space for everyone, but Sarah felt I was undermining her relationship. Things got heated, and by the end of the night, I felt like I had lost my friend over this.

I’ve been reflecting on whether I was out of line for saying something. I genuinely care about Sarah and didn’t intend to attack Jack, but I also believe in standing up for what I think is right. A few mutual friends have sided with Sarah, saying that I should have just kept quiet. On the other hand, others have told me that it’s okay to speak up when someone is making jokes at the expense of others.

So, am I the asshole for trying to call out Jack's comments, or was I justified in wanting to protect my friends from potentially harmful attitudes?",466,1958,0.62,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_67296,2019-12-24 00:00:00,NAH,2097,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I know this might sound a bit silly, but hear me out.

So, I (24F) recently moved in with my boyfriend (25M) after dating for about a year. We both have our quirks, and one of his is that he has an obsession with collecting vintage board games. I think it's a fun hobby, and I enjoy playing games with him. However, he has a pretty large collection, and it's starting to take over our living room.

At first, I didn’t mind the games being around, but as more and more boxes appeared, it became a bit overwhelming. There are stacks of them on the coffee table, the shelves are nearly bursting, and I can barely find space for my books and things. Plus, it’s starting to look a bit cluttered, and I value a tidy living space.

I brought this up gently to him, explaining that while I appreciate his passion for board games, I felt like we needed to establish some boundaries about how many could be in the main living area. I suggested we could set up a specific spot for his collection or even rotate the games in and out, so we always have a couple available without the whole room looking like a game store.

He seemed taken aback at first. He thought I was trying to limit his hobby, which wasn’t my intention at all! I reassured him that I loved playing games with him and just wanted to find a balance. After discussing it further, he understood where I was coming from and agreed to help organize the space better.

Now we’re working together to create a designated game area, and I think it’s going to be a fun project for us. I feel like we both have valid points—he loves his collection, and I prefer a tidy living space. 

So, AITA for suggesting we rearrange our living room to accommodate both our preferences?

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been together for about two years, and we generally have a strong, trusting relationship. We both value open communication, but we’re also pretty independent people with our own lives and friendships. Recently, I’ve been spending time with a close friend of mine, who I’ve known for over a decade. We’ve always had a platonic friendship, and I consider her to be like family.

Last weekend, we organized a small get-together at her place, just a few friends hanging out. My partner was invited but had to work late, so I went without them. During the evening, my friend and I ended up on the couch watching a movie. It was a pretty crowded space, and we were sitting next to each other, but we weren’t being overly touchy or anything, just comfortable. 

When I got home, my partner was a bit upset. They told me they felt uncomfortable with how close I was to my friend, even though nothing inappropriate happened. They expressed that they trust me but felt like it was crossing a boundary, especially since we were alone together. I reassured them that it was just a friendly hangout and that I love and respect our relationship.

We had a long discussion about it, and I understood their feelings. I told them I would be more mindful in the future, especially when it comes to physical proximity. While I think they might have been overreacting a bit, I also recognize that everyone has different comfort levels in relationships.

No one is the Asshole,"Sorry for the length, TLDR at the end! This is my first post, so please bear with me.

Background: My partner (P) and I are planning to move in together after being together for about two years. We’ve both been living with our respective parents to save money and are excited about taking this next step. 

However, P has a younger sibling (S) who is known for being a bit difficult. S has always been very vocal about their opinions on what P should do with their life, including their relationship with me. This has led to some tension, especially when S made a few snide comments about our plans to move in together, saying that “it was too soon” and that “P should focus on their career instead.”

Recently, while discussing our moving plans with our family, S decided to chime in with their thoughts again. They made a comment suggesting that I’m a bad influence on P and that I only want to move in to “take control” of their life. This upset both P and me, as it felt completely out of line and disrespectful to our relationship.

In response, I spoke up and told S that their comments were hurtful and unwelcome. I tried to explain that P and I are making this decision together as adults and that it’s not their place to judge. S got defensive and argued back, leading to an uncomfortable family dinner where tensions were high.

P later told me that they appreciated me standing up for us but expressed concern about how it would affect their relationship with S. P wants to maintain a good relationship with their sibling and feels caught in the middle. They suggested that I should have handled it more delicately and not have confronted S in front of everyone.

I feel that standing up for myself and our relationship was important, but I also understand P’s desire to keep the peace in the family. I’m conflicted about whether I should have approached the situation differently or if I was justified in speaking up.

TLDR: My partner's sibling made hurtful comments about our plans to move in together, and I confronted them during a family gathering. My partner appreciates my support but is worried about causing tension in the family.

No one is the Asshole,"Title: My friend asked me to help with her surprise birthday party, but I unintentionally spilled the beans.

So, my close friend, Sarah, approached me a couple of weeks ago. She wanted to throw a surprise birthday party for our mutual friend, Emily, who was turning 30. Sarah asked me to help with planning and coordinating the event. I was excited and agreed to help.

We spent a lot of time discussing the details—venue, guest list, and decorations. I was really invested in making it special for Emily. However, in the midst of all the planning, I made a mistake. 

A few days before the party, I was chatting with Emily during lunch, and I mentioned something like, “I can’t wait to celebrate your birthday this weekend!” Emily looked puzzled and asked what I meant. I immediately realized my mistake and panicked. I tried to cover up by saying I was just excited about a dinner we were planning. 

When Sarah found out that I had inadvertently let it slip, she was understandably upset. She felt that I had ruined the surprise and put a lot of blame on me for not being careful. I felt terrible because I really didn’t mean to spoil anything, but I also didn’t want to make Sarah feel worse.

In the end, the party went off without a hitch, and Emily was genuinely surprised, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I messed things up for Sarah. I apologized profusely, and she did say it was okay, but I still feel bad about the whole situation.

No one is the Asshole,"A few weeks ago, my best friend and I went to a local art gallery that was showcasing a new exhibit. We’ve always shared a love for art, and I was really excited to explore this new collection with her. However, when we got there, I noticed that my friend seemed more interested in taking selfies and posting on social media than actually engaging with the art itself.

I tried to point out some pieces I thought were interesting, but she would just say, “Hold on, I need to get the right angle for this photo.” After a while, I felt a bit frustrated because I wanted to enjoy the experience together, not just as a backdrop for her posts. So, I jokingly said, “Are you here for the art or just for Instagram?” 

She laughed at first, but then she got defensive and said that she could appreciate the art in her own way. I realized I may have hurt her feelings, even though I didn’t mean to. So, I quickly apologized and told her that I just wanted us to enjoy the exhibit together. 

We ended up having a good conversation about how we both experience art differently, and she even put her phone away for a bit to really look at some paintings. I felt relieved, but I still wondered if I had crossed a line by bringing it up at all. 

Afterward, we had a great time and I think we both learned something about each other. I just hope I didn’t come off as too harsh or judgmental in the moment.",57,1781,0.86,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_36769,2022-03-25 00:00:00,NAH,1394,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So I’m part of a community group that organizes local events, and recently we planned a big charity fundraiser for a cause that means a lot to me. I volunteered to lead the planning, and everyone was excited. We’ve been working on it for months, and I’ve put a lot of time and effort into making it a success.

About a week before the event, I got a call from an old friend who lives out of town. She mentioned that she’d be in the area for a wedding and asked if we could catch up. I was thrilled to hear from her and wanted to see her, but I realized that the date of the wedding clashed with our fundraiser. I debated for a while and decided that I could still make our event work. I figured I could just show up a bit late to the fundraiser.

When I told the group about my plans, I was met with mixed reactions. Some members were supportive and understood that I wanted to reconnect with my friend, but others were disappointed that I wouldn’t be fully present for the event I had led. They felt it was unfair to leave them short-staffed right before something so important.

In the end, I attended the fundraiser but arrived later than planned. It went well, and I helped out as much as I could once I got there. However, I still felt a bit guilty for not being there from the start, even though I was excited to see my friend.

No one is the Asshole,"So, my partner and I have been planning a small gathering for our friends this weekend, and we wanted to keep it low-key with some snacks and drinks. As we were making arrangements, I suggested we have a potluck style event where everyone brings a dish. My partner was initially on board, but later expressed some concerns about it getting out of hand with too many different foods and dietary restrictions.

After discussing it, we decided it would be easier if I just handle the food myself to simplify things. I was totally fine with that, but I also thought it would be nice to ask our friends if any of them wanted to contribute a dish, especially since we have a few friends who are really good cooks. So, I sent out a casual group message suggesting that if anyone wanted to bring something, they were welcome to, but I would mainly be in charge of the food.

Well, one of our friends, who has a food allergy, expressed that they were really looking forward to attending but were worried about not being able to eat anything if I didn’t know all the ingredients in what I was making. I completely understand their concern and want to make sure everyone feels included and safe. I thought it was a fair point, so I assured them I would make sure to label everything clearly, and would even make a couple of allergy-friendly dishes just for them.

However, my partner was frustrated with the whole situation and felt that I should have just stuck to my original plan of making everything myself. They felt that by opening the door for others to bring food, it complicated things more than necessary. I explained that I wanted everyone to feel like they had a stake in the gathering and that it could be a fun way to mix things up.

We ended up having a bit of a disagreement about it, but we both realized we just have different perspectives on hosting. In the end, I decided to take the extra step to accommodate everyone, and my partner agreed to help me with the planning and setup. I think we both learned a bit about communication and compromise in the process.

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I (both in our early 30s) have been together for about five years. We recently moved in together and have been discussing our future, including the possibility of marriage and starting a family. One thing we've always agreed on is that we want to adopt rather than have biological children. Both of us have our reasons; I have health issues that make pregnancy risky, and my partner has a strong desire to foster kids who need homes.

Last week, we were having dinner, and I brought up the topic of adoption again. My partner suddenly seemed withdrawn, and after some prodding, he revealed that he had been thinking about having a biological child. He expressed that he felt a strong pull to experience that part of parenthood, even if it meant going against what we had previously agreed upon. 

I was taken aback, not because I don’t understand where he’s coming from, but because it felt like a complete shift in our plans. We’ve both shared so much about our pasts and why we chose adoption, and this felt like a loss of trust in our mutual decision. I tried to express my feelings without accusing him, but I admit I got emotional and raised my voice slightly. He then got upset and left the room.

After some time apart, we managed to sit down and talk it out. I apologized for not being more understanding in the moment, and he apologized for not discussing his feelings sooner. We both realized that we were just caught off guard by the shift in our plans. We agreed that it’s important to be open about these feelings, even if it leads to difficult conversations. 

In the end, we decided to take some time individually to reflect on our desires for the future and reconvene to discuss it again. I believe we both want the same thing in the end: to be good parents, whatever that looks like for us.

A few weeks before the trip, my friend’s sister had a medical emergency and had to undergo surgery. My friend, being very close to her sister, decided she wanted to be there for her during recovery instead of going on the trip.

I completely understood her decision and told her I’d support whatever she needed to do. However, after some days, she suggested that I still go on the trip without her since I had already planned everything. At first, I was enthusiastic about the idea, but then I realized that the trip wouldn’t be the same without her. We’ve always done these kinds of adventures together, and it felt wrong to go alone.

I told her that I appreciated the offer, but I’d rather postpone the trip until she could join me. She seemed a bit disappointed but accepted my decision. However, she then suggested that I could take a different friend along instead. I had to think about it, and while I felt guilty for not wanting to invite another friend, I also felt that our trip had a certain vibe and history that wouldn’t be the same with someone else.

Eventually, I declined to go with another friend and decided to wait until my original plan could be fulfilled.

Last weekend, we had some friends over for a small get-together. I decided to create a playlist that included some of my favorite classic rock songs to set the vibe. When my partner heard the playlist, they expressed their disappointment and asked if we could play something else that was more upbeat and modern.

I understood where they were coming from, but I really wanted to share music that was meaningful to me with our friends. I suggested that we could alternate songs, playing a couple of my picks and then a couple of theirs. My partner agreed, but every time I played one of my songs, they would visibly cringe or make comments about how ""old"" it sounded.

I'm currently in a bit of a situation with my best friend, Sarah. We've been close for years, and recently, she's been going through a tough time after a breakup. She's been feeling really down, and I've been trying to support her as much as I can.

Last week, Sarah asked me if I could come over to help her organize her apartment. I agreed, thinking it would be a good way to lift her spirits. We spent the whole day cleaning and chatting. At one point, she started talking about her ex, and I listened. But then, she asked me if I thought he would come back, and I hesitated. I told her that sometimes it's better to move on and that she deserves someone who truly values her.

Sarah got upset and said I was being harsh and that she just wanted someone to tell her things would be okay. I felt bad because I genuinely wanted to help, but I also didn’t want to lie to her. We had a bit of a disagreement, and Sarah said I was being unsupportive. I left feeling unsure if I had done the right thing.

I talked to another friend about it, and they said that while I meant well, I should have been more sensitive to her feelings. I just wanted to be honest since I care about her.

No one is the Asshole,"My friend group has always been pretty close-knit, and over the years, we’ve developed a tradition of hosting monthly game nights. We all take turns hosting at our respective homes, and it’s something we all look forward to. Recently, we decided to try a new game that I was really excited about. I spent a good amount of time prepping for it, creating snacks, and setting up the game in my living room, making sure everything was perfect for the evening.

On the day of the game night, one of my friends, Sarah, texted me saying she might not be able to make it because she was feeling under the weather. I told her that she should come anyway, as I had everything set up and I didn’t want her to miss out. I even offered to set her up in a cozy corner of the couch with some blankets and snacks to keep her comfortable.

However, when she arrived, it was clear that she was unwell. She was quiet and didn’t seem to be enjoying herself. After a while, I noticed that she was just sitting there, looking miserable, and decided it might be best for her to head home and rest. I suggested it gently, saying, “Hey, I know you’re not feeling great, and I don’t want you to feel pressured to stay if you’re not up for it.”

She responded, “I appreciate that, but I really wanted to be here. I can’t stand missing out on our game nights.” I felt bad, but I insisted that it would be better for her to rest and recover. Eventually, she agreed and left, but I could sense that she was upset about having to go home early.

Afterward, I felt conflicted. I wanted her to be part of the fun, but I also didn’t want to put her health at risk. I tried to check in on her later that week, and she seemed to appreciate it but mentioned she felt a bit hurt for having to leave early. I told her that I was just looking out for her and hoped she'd understand.

I discussed the situation with some other friends, and they seemed to think I did the right thing by encouraging her to go home. But now I’m second-guessing myself. Did I overstep by insisting she leave the game night? Should I have let her stay, even if it meant she might not enjoy herself? I’m torn about whether I did the right thing.

After a while, Sarah started to share stories about her journey in her career, which led to her promotion. As she spoke, I noticed that she seemed a bit anxious and kept glancing at her partner, Mark.

After a while, I asked her how she felt about the promotion and if she was excited about the new responsibilities. Sarah hesitated and said she was happy but felt a lot of pressure. I wanted to lighten the mood and jokingly said, “Well, at least you don’t have to worry about being bossed around anymore, right?” Mark immediately chimed in and said, “That’s not true at all! Managers are often more stressed than their employees and have to deal with way more.” 

I thought he was being a bit too serious and said, “I was just joking, Mark. You don’t have to take everything so literally.” Sarah looked uncomfortable, and I realized I may have crossed a line by putting Mark’s perspective down. I quickly tried to backtrack and said, “I didn’t mean to offend you; I was just trying to make light of the situation.” 

Mark shrugged it off, but I could tell that the atmosphere shifted slightly. The conversation moved on, but I felt a bit uneasy for the rest of the night. Later, I talked to a mutual friend who said that Mark can be sensitive about his opinions and that I should be more careful in the future.

She wanted it to be a big celebration since it's her first child. Naturally, I was excited to help out and support her, so I volunteered to organize the event. 

I started planning everything, but as I got into the details, I realized that the venue she wanted was way more expensive than I anticipated. We were looking at around $2,000 just for the space, not to mention food, decorations, and other costs. I also had my own bills to pay, and while I wanted to contribute to my sister's special day, I couldn’t afford that kind of money without seriously impacting my own finances.

After discussing it with my sister, I suggested we look for a more affordable venue or consider hosting the shower at her house. At first, she seemed open to the idea, but then she got upset, saying she had her heart set on the venue and that it was just a one-time event. I felt torn because I genuinely wanted her to have a beautiful shower but also didn't want to put myself in a bad financial situation.

In the end, I agreed to help find ways to cut costs and even offered my home for the shower, but she still insisted on the original venue. I told her I couldn’t contribute financially if we went that route, which led to a bit of a falling out. She felt hurt that I wouldn’t support her wishes and I felt guilty for not being able to make it work.

Last weekend, she asked me to help her choose her wedding dress. I was thrilled to be part of such an important moment! We went to a few bridal shops, and she tried on several dresses. There was one particular dress that she loved, but I just didn’t think it suited her body shape well. It was beautiful, but it didn't highlight her figure the way I thought it should. 

I hesitated but eventually told her that I thought she could find something even more flattering. I suggested a couple of other styles that I thought would look amazing on her. To my surprise, she got really upset. She felt like I was criticizing her choice and that I didn’t appreciate her taste. I immediately apologized and tried to explain that I just wanted her to look and feel her best on her special day.

After our conversation, I felt guilty but also felt that I had valid points. I never meant to hurt her feelings, and I genuinely want her to look stunning. However, I also understand that it’s her wedding, and ultimately, she should wear what makes her happy.

Later that night, we talked it over again, and she admitted that she was just feeling overwhelmed with everything and took it out on me. We both realized that neither of us was in the wrong; we just had a miscommunication during a stressful time.

As the party approached, I felt overwhelmed. I wanted to be there for her but also feared that my anxiety would ruin the atmosphere. A few days before the event, I offered to help her with the decorations and food, thinking it might ease my nerves. She appreciated the help and we worked together, which was nice. But on the day of the party, as guests started to arrive, I began to feel panic rising.

Instead of staying and pushing through, I decided to step outside for some fresh air. I thought I would return after calming down, but I ended up sitting on the porch for a long time. During that time, I overheard my sister telling her friends that I was ""being weird"" and ""couldn't handle it,"" which made me feel even worse.

Eventually, I went back inside but could tell the mood had shifted slightly. I felt terrible for leaving her to manage everything alone. When I apologized to her afterward, she said she was hurt that I didn’t try harder to enjoy the party with her. I explained my anxiety, and while she understood, I could see how disappointed she was.

I shared a few funny anecdotes about my recent dating experiences, which got a lot of laughs. My friend Sarah, who had been in a long-term relationship that recently ended, seemed a bit quieter than usual during this part of the conversation, but I didn't think much of it at the time.

She said she felt overshadowed and that the conversation unintentionally focused on things she wasn’t ready to talk about.

I felt terrible for not recognizing her discomfort during the dinner. I replied to her and apologized for not being more sensitive; it was not my intention to make her feel bad. Sarah appreciated the apology, and we were able to talk it out, which helped clear the air.

A couple of weeks before the trip, one of my friends, Sarah (27F), reached out to me. She mentioned that her brother was having some trouble with his car and needed a ride to a town a few hours away. He had some important commitments there, and she asked if I would mind if she brought him along for part of the trip. Sarah said she would drop him off and then join us at the cabin afterward. 

Initially, I was a bit taken aback. I felt like our trip was something special for just us, and having her brother tag along seemed like it would change the dynamic of our weekend. However, I also understood that family comes first, and she was just trying to help him out. I expressed my feelings to Sarah honestly, explaining that I was worried it would affect the vibe of our trip, but I was also willing to work with her if it was important to her.

I (27f) have been living with my boyfriend (29m) for the past year, and we have a pretty solid relationship. However, there has been a recurring issue that recently came to a head. My boyfriend has a close group of friends, and they often make jokes that I find offensive, particularly about body image and weight. While I understand that they might not mean any harm, the jokes often hit too close to home for me due to my own struggles with body image over the years.

I felt a rush of emotions and decided to speak up. I calmly expressed that I found the joke insensitive and that body shaming is a serious issue. I explained my own experiences and how it affects me when those kinds of jokes are made. My boyfriend was supportive and backed me up, but his friends were taken aback and a bit uncomfortable.

After the incident, my boyfriend told me that he appreciated me speaking up but mentioned that his friends might feel like I overreacted and that it could create tension in the group. He said he didn’t want to make things awkward, and I understood where he was coming from. It wasn’t my intention to create an uncomfortable environment for him.

About a week ago, I reached a breaking point. I was feeling neglected and hurt by her lack of communication and felt like I was putting in all the effort. I decided to confront her, hoping to express my feelings without being harsh. I told her that I felt like I was losing her and that I missed the connection we used to have. I emphasized that I understood she was dealing with a lot, but it felt like she was pushing me away.

The conversation didn't go well. Jamie became defensive and accused me of being unsupportive and not understanding the gravity of her situation. I felt awful, as that was never my intention. I apologized for how I approached her but stood by the fact that I was struggling too. We ended up having a heated argument and didn’t talk for a few days.

He would often cancel our plans, saying he needed to study, but I could tell something deeper was bothering him. I tried to reach out and support him, but he was reluctant to open up.

One day, I found out that he was having a tough time not just academically, but also personally. His family was going through a rough patch and he felt a lot of pressure to succeed. I felt for him and wanted to help, but I also realized that I was beginning to feel drained trying to support him emotionally.

After a few months of this, I started to realize that my own mental health was suffering. I was feeling increasingly anxious and stressed, and I found myself pulling away from my other friends to focus on Jake. I ultimately decided that I needed to prioritize my own well-being, and I started to limit my interactions with him, explaining that I needed some space to focus on my studies and self-care.

This decision did not go over well. Jake felt abandoned and accused me of not being a true friend, while other friends in our group took sides. Some believed I was right to take care of myself, while others thought I should have stuck it out for Jake’s sake.

In the end, I reached out to him to clarify my intentions. I explained that I cared about him but needed to step back to prevent my own mental health from deteriorating further. He eventually came to understand my position, and we both agreed that we could still be friends, but we needed to give each other space.

Now I’m left wondering if I did the right thing. Am I the asshole for stepping back when my friend needed support, or was it fair to prioritize my own mental health?",910,2526,0.57,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_72765,2019-10-19 00:00:00,NAH,2066,AITA

He used to hang out with me almost every weekend, but now he’s always busy with his girlfriend. I understand that he’s in a new relationship and wants to spend time with her, but it feels like he’s forgotten about our friendship. The last time we hung out just the two of us was about three months ago, and even then, he kept talking about his girlfriend.

I decided to reach out and express my feelings. I told him that I miss hanging out and that I feel like I’m losing my best friend. I tried to approach it gently, acknowledging that relationships take time, but I just wanted to see if we could carve out some time for each other.

He seemed a bit taken aback and mentioned that he didn’t realize I felt that way. He assured me that he values our friendship and would like to make more of an effort to hang out. I felt relieved after our conversation, but now I’m second-guessing myself.

We share a lot of interests, especially music, and often go to concerts together. Recently, I got tickets to see one of our favorite bands in concert, and I was really excited to go with her.

However, a few weeks before the concert, she told me that her cousin was coming to visit from out of town and she wanted to spend time with him instead. I completely understood that family is important, but I was really bummed because I had been looking forward to this concert for months.

When I mentioned how disappointed I was, she felt bad and offered to let me take someone else instead, but I insisted I’d rather go with her. We ended up in a bit of an awkward situation because I didn’t want to pressure her into choosing between her family and our plans.

In the end, she decided to go to the concert with me, but the whole situation made me feel guilty for wanting her to prioritize our friendship over family. I know she didn't want to hurt my feelings, but I also didn’t want her to miss out on time with her cousin.

We were all chatting and getting to know her, and everything was going well. At one point, someone made a joke about something silly happening in the news, and I jokingly said, ""That's just classic!"" while rolling my eyes.

Mia, who seemed to be a bit more sensitive and thoughtful, said she didn’t appreciate jokes that trivialized serious issues, and mentioned how it made her uncomfortable. I quickly realized that my comment might have come off as dismissive, so I apologized and explained that I didn’t mean to undermine anything serious.

My friend has always wanted a themed party, and she mentioned in passing that she loved the idea of a 90s nostalgia theme. I got really excited and started planning everything in detail—decor, music, games, all the classic 90s vibes. I even reached out to some of our mutual friends to help me organize the event and keep it a surprise.

However, I found out from one of our friends that my best friend has been feeling a bit anxious about turning 30. She doesn't want a big celebration because she feels like it's a reminder of aging, and she would prefer something low-key, like a small dinner. I had no idea she felt this way, and I feel torn. 

On one hand, I want to honor her feelings and respect her wishes, but on the other hand, I really think she would enjoy the party once it’s happening, especially since it’s a 90s theme. I reached out to her to ask if she’d be open to a themed party, but I also mentioned that if she’d prefer something low-key, I’d completely understand.

No one is the Asshole,"Throwaway account for personal reasons. So here’s the situation: I’m a 25-year-old male, and I live in a small town where everyone knows each other. Recently, I’ve been volunteering at a local shelter that helps homeless people find housing and access resources. It’s been a rewarding experience, but it’s also opened my eyes to some hard realities.

About a month ago, I met a woman named Sarah at the shelter. She was in her early 30s, and we struck up a conversation. She shared her story about how she lost her job and her apartment due to unforeseen circumstances and was doing her best to get back on her feet. We talked for hours, and I felt a genuine connection with her. I started helping her with job applications and offered to review her resume.

After a couple of weeks of working together, I invited her to grab coffee after our volunteer shift. I thought it would be nice to get to know her better without the stress of the shelter environment. We had a great time, and I suggested that if she ever needed someone to practice for job interviews with, I’d be happy to help. She seemed really appreciative and we ended up exchanging numbers.

However, after that coffee date, I noticed some of my friends were hesitant about my friendship with her. They were worried because she was in a vulnerable situation and that I might be getting too close too quickly. I tried to explain that I was just trying to help someone in need and that I didn’t see anything inappropriate about it. Still, their concerns made me second guess whether I was doing the right thing.

A few days later, I ran into Sarah again at the shelter and felt like I needed to address my friends’ worries. I told her that I wanted to keep our relationship strictly friendly and focused on her job search, as I didn’t want to make things complicated for either of us. She looked a bit disappointed but agreed. 

Since then, our interactions have been more professional, and she has been making progress in her job search, which I’m proud of. However, I can’t help but feel like I might have hurt her feelings by putting up that boundary. I did it out of concern for both of us, but I wonder if I overreacted.

No one is the Asshole,"I’m really hoping to get some clarity on this situation because I’m feeling a bit lost about whether I mishandled things or if it was just a misunderstanding. Here’s what happened:

A few days ago, I was attending a small gathering at a friend’s house. It was a relaxed get-together with about ten people, and we were all just enjoying each other’s company. At one point, I noticed that one of the guests, let’s call her Sarah, seemed a bit withdrawn. She was sitting by herself and not really engaging in the conversations happening around her. 

Since I’m someone who likes to make sure everyone feels included, I decided to approach her. I asked if she was okay and if she wanted to join us in a game we were about to start. Sarah smiled but said she was just fine and preferred to sit by herself for a while. I respected her wishes but felt a little uneasy about her sitting alone while everyone else was socializing.

Later in the evening, I noticed she still wasn’t interacting much, so I went over again and invited her to play a different game, thinking maybe a change of activity would help. Again, she politely declined, saying she just wanted to take some time to herself. I reassured her that it was totally fine and that she was welcome to join us whenever she felt like it.

After a couple more attempts to engage her, I started to feel like I was being pushy, so I backed off. But I also felt genuinely concerned. I mentioned to a couple of friends that I was worried Sarah seemed a bit lonely. They immediately suggested that I might be overstepping and that some people just prefer their space, which made me question whether I had crossed a line.

Now I’m left wondering if I was being considerate by trying to include her or if I was actually being annoying by not taking her “no” for an answer. I really just wanted her to feel welcome, but I also don’t want to come off as intrusive.

I felt really torn because I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings, but I also wanted to make sure I was ready for that discussion.

No one is the Asshole,"So, a little backstory: I (28F) recently moved into a new neighborhood and wanted to get to know my neighbors better. I decided to host a small get-together at my place, inviting everyone on my street for some snacks and drinks. I thought it would be a fun way to break the ice.

I sent out invites and planned everything carefully, making sure to have a variety of snacks, including some appetizers for those who might be health-conscious. I didn't know everyone’s dietary restrictions, so I made sure to have both vegetarian and gluten-free options.

The day of the event, I was really excited. I had about 10 neighbors show up, and we all started mingling. However, one neighbor (let's call her Lisa, 32F) arrived and seemed a bit off from the start. She looked around at the food and made a comment about how she hoped I wouldn't serve any ""weird"" stuff.

I laughed it off, but I noticed she seemed to be frowning at the options I had laid out. I had some hummus and veggie sticks, along with cheese and crackers. I thought they were pretty standard party food, but Lisa kept making snide remarks about it. 

As the evening went on, she made a comment about how she couldn’t believe I didn’t have any “real food” or a “proper meal” for people. I felt a bit embarrassed but tried to lighten the mood by joking that the snacks were just ""appetizers to hold us over until dinner.""

Later, when some of the neighbors started to leave, Lisa pulled me aside and said, ""Next time, maybe consider actually feeding your guests instead of just giving them a few veggies."" I was taken aback and felt defensive, but I tried to explain that it was just a casual get-together and that I wanted to keep things light and fun.

I ended up feeling really conflicted about it. I wanted to make everyone comfortable, but Lisa gave off an air of entitlement and rudeness. So, I’m left wondering if I should have catered to her preferences more or if she was being unreasonable for expecting a full dinner at a casual gathering.

My partner has a younger sister, who has recently had a baby too. While we love our families, there’s been a bit of tension lately because of some different parenting styles and how we view certain activities for our kids.

Last month, my sister-in-law invited us to a family gathering to celebrate her baby's first birthday. At the party, I noticed that she was letting the kids run wild, allowing them to play with some toys that weren't age-appropriate. I felt uncomfortable because I know how easily accidents can happen, especially with little ones around. 

During the party, I gently suggested to my sister-in-law that maybe we could keep certain toys out of reach or provide some safer options for the younger kids.

We’ve been living together for about a year, and although we get along well, we come from very different backgrounds. I grew up in a small town where community and family ties are strong, and my parents always emphasized the importance of helping others in need. Sarah, on the other hand, is from a big city and was raised to prioritize independence and personal space.

A few weeks ago, a mutual friend of ours, Jake (26M), lost his job and was really struggling to make ends meet. I offered him some temporary help by letting him crash on our couch for a couple of weeks while he looked for a new job. I thought it would be a nice gesture, and I genuinely wanted to help him out during a tough time.

She said that it was inconsiderate of me to invite someone into our home without discussing it with her first, especially since she values her privacy and space.

As I was preparing for the trip, I started to feel guilty about asking for help and worried that it might have come across as me expecting something from them. So, I decided to write a heartfelt message to the couple, thanking them for their offer and expressing my gratitude. I made sure to clarify that I didn’t want to impose and certainly didn’t expect them to provide accommodation.

When I arrived at the wedding, I was greeted warmly by the couple, and they reassured me that they were genuinely happy to help and that they wanted all their friends to be able to celebrate with them, regardless of budget constraints. This really eased my mind, and I was able to enjoy the event fully without feeling like a burden.

Later, during the reception, I overheard some comments from other guests about how the couple's generosity was admirable and that it was nice to see a couple prioritizing their friends' well-being during such a busy time. It made me think that maybe asking for help wasn’t such a bad idea after all.

So, AITA for reaching out to the couple about my financial concerns and asking for suggestions on affordable accommodations?

WIBTA OR AITA?

I (29M) have a close friend, let’s call him Mike (30M). We've been friends for over a decade and have shared a lot of life experiences. Recently, Mike has been going through a tough time. He lost his job a few months ago, and it’s really taken a toll on him both financially and emotionally. 

He moved back in with his parents while he figures things out, and I’ve been trying to be supportive. I often check in on him and invite him out for coffee or to hang out just to get him out of the house. However, he’s been in a pretty dark place and doesn’t always take me up on those offers. 

Last weekend, I had a small gathering at my place with a few friends. I thought it would be a good opportunity to lift his spirits, so I reached out to invite him. He told me he wasn’t up for it and just wanted to stay home. I understood and told him I was there for him if he changed his mind. 

During the gathering, we all ended up having a great time, and someone suggested we play a game that involved passing around a silly party hat. It was light-hearted and fun, and we all laughed a lot. I took pictures throughout the night to capture the moments.

A few days later, I shared some of those photos on social media. I didn’t think much of it, but I noticed Mike was upset when I texted him to check in. He told me he felt left out and that seeing the pictures made him even more aware of how disconnected he felt from everyone. He said it was hard for him to see us all enjoying ourselves when he was feeling down.

I felt really bad. I didn’t mean to hurt him; I just wanted to share a fun moment with our friends. I apologized for not considering how he might feel and assured him it wasn’t meant to exclude him. 

Now I’m left wondering if I was wrong for posting those pictures or if Mike is being overly sensitive given his circumstances. 

So WIBTA or AITA?

No one is the Asshole,"So, I recently started a new job at a company that values teamwork and collaboration. I was really excited about it because I thrive in environments where I can bounce ideas off others and work together towards common goals. My team consists of four people, including myself, and we all have different backgrounds and expertise.

In our first week, we had a brainstorming session to come up with ideas for a project. One of my coworkers, Sarah, suggested a really creative approach that I thought had a lot of potential. I got really enthusiastic and started building on her idea, suggesting more details and ways to implement it. However, as I was speaking, I noticed that another coworker, Mike, seemed to be getting frustrated. 

After the session, Mike pulled me aside and expressed that he felt I was overshadowing Sarah and not giving her enough credit for her initial idea. I was genuinely surprised because that was not my intention at all. I thought I was helping to elevate her idea and making it better. 

The next day, I made a point to approach Sarah and tell her how much I appreciated her suggestion and that I wanted her to lead the project since it was her idea. She seemed really grateful and excited. I also spoke with Mike afterwards, explaining my perspective and that I didn’t mean to come off as dismissive of Sarah’s contribution. Instead, I was just really passionate about the project. 

We both agreed that clear communication in the future would help avoid misunderstandings. I think we all learned from the situation, and the team dynamic improved significantly after that.

No one is the Asshole,"I’m a 24F and I recently moved to a new city for work. I was really excited about it, but I didn’t know anyone here. I was feeling pretty lonely at first and decided to put myself out there by joining a few local clubs and attending community events. 

One of the clubs I joined was a weekly trivia night at a local pub. I thought it would be a great way to meet people, and it absolutely was! I started going regularly, and after a few weeks, I made some friends in the group. We would team up for trivia, go out for drinks afterward, and have a lot of fun.

A few weeks ago, one of my new friends, Mike, mentioned that he was having a birthday party and invited everyone from the trivia club. I was really excited and wanted to make it special for him, so I offered to help him organize the party and bring some snacks. He was grateful and said it would be great to have someone to help.

As the day of the party approached, I felt a little anxious because I wasn’t sure how many people would show up or what the vibe would be like. I wanted to make sure everyone had a good time. When the day arrived, I brought a bunch of homemade treats and some games to play. However, when I got to the party, I felt like I was trying too hard. The vibe was pretty laid-back, and I noticed that most people were just hanging out and chatting rather than playing games. 

I realized I may have overstepped by bringing so much stuff and trying to take charge of the activities. Noticing that, I backed off and let Mike and the others lead the night. I even apologized to Mike later for trying to take control of his birthday celebration. He assured me that it was fine, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had embarrassed myself a bit.

I’ve been reflecting on whether I was too eager to impress everyone and if I crossed a line by trying to take over the party. I really just wanted to contribute and help make it fun.

Last weekend, we planned a game night. We set it for 7 PM, and I specifically told them we would start at that time because I had plans early the next morning. They assured me they would be there on time. When 7 PM rolled around, my partner and I were ready, but they hadn’t arrived. By 7:30 PM, we started to get concerned. I texted them, asking if they were still coming, and they replied that they were running late and would be there in another half hour.

At that point, I was feeling really frustrated because I had reorganized my schedule for this. I decided to start the game without them to keep things moving. By the time they arrived at 8 PM, we were already deep into the first game. They seemed a bit miffed when they walked in and saw us playing without waiting for them.

I felt bad for not waiting, but I also didn’t want to ruin the night by just sitting around and waiting for them. They ended up joining us, but there was an awkward tension for the rest of the night. Afterward, they mentioned to me that they felt disrespected for not being waited on, while I felt like I had communicated my needs clearly.

No one is the Asshole,"Title: AITA for pulling back from a friendship after feeling sidelined?

First time posting, so please bear with me. 

I’ve had a close friendship with my friend Amy for over a decade. We’ve been through a lot together, from college challenges to job struggles and everything in between. We were each other’s support system, and I always thought we’d be there for each other through thick and thin.

Recently, Amy got engaged, which I was genuinely thrilled about. However, as the wedding planning progressed, I noticed that I wasn’t as involved as I thought I would be. She had a small bridal party, and when the invitations went out, I realized I wasn’t one of her bridesmaids. At first, I tried to brush it off, thinking it was just a small detail, but as I saw her posting about bridal showers and fittings with her other friends, that feeling of exclusion started to sting more than I anticipated.

After some reflection, I decided to talk to her about how I felt. I sent her a message expressing my hurt, making sure to emphasize that I wasn't trying to blame her but just wanted to be honest about my feelings. She responded kindly, saying she didn’t mean to hurt me and that her choice was based on a variety of factors, including the size of the wedding.

Despite her understanding, I found myself withdrawing from the friendship. I wasn’t rude or confrontational, but I stopped reaching out as much and didn’t make an effort to hang out. I felt like if I wasn’t deemed important enough for her big day, maybe I shouldn’t invest as much in the friendship anymore. 

I still care for her and want her to be happy, which is why I decided to get her a thoughtful wedding gift. I created a scrapbook of our memories together, highlighting all the good times we've had. I figured it could serve as a reminder of our friendship, at least from my perspective, even if we might grow apart.

Now that the wedding is approaching, I’m left wondering if I’m being unreasonable for feeling hurt and for pulling back. I still support her and wish her the best, but I can’t shake the feeling of being sidelined.

No one is the Asshole,"My friend and I are both avid hikers, and we often plan weekend trips to explore new trails. Recently, we decided to tackle a popular mountain trail that had been on our list for a while. We invited a couple of our friends to join us, but one of them, Sarah, mentioned that she was recovering from an ankle sprain and wasn’t sure if she was up for the hike.

We all discussed it as a group and decided that we would go at a slower pace to accommodate her. The day of the hike arrived, and we set off. As we were hiking, it became clear that while Sarah was doing her best, she was struggling more than we had anticipated. 

Halfway through, Sarah mentioned that she wanted to turn back because she was feeling uncomfortable. I suggested that a couple of us could go back with her while the others continued to the summit, and Sarah agreed. However, once we started heading back, my friend Alex complained that he felt like we were wasting everyone’s time and that we should just push through.

I felt torn because I wanted to respect Sarah’s limits, but I could also see Alex's frustration. Eventually, we decided that I would stay with Sarah while Alex and another friend continued to the top. I reassured Sarah that it was okay to turn back and that we’d make sure she got back safely.

While I was waiting with Sarah, I could hear Alex and our other friend cheering from the summit when they made it to the top. I felt bad for holding everyone back, but I also felt it was important to prioritize Sarah’s well-being.

Afterward, Alex expressed his annoyance at the decision to turn back, but I explained that it was a group hike, and we had to consider everyone's abilities. It was a good discussion, and I think we all understood each other’s perspectives better.

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have a 5-year-old son who loves to draw and create. He’s particularly into making elaborate drawings with lots of colors and details, which we both encourage. Recently, he started expressing interest in learning how to paint, and we decided to get him a small watercolor set to try it out.

The first time he used the watercolors, he was so excited and ended up splattering paint everywhere—on the table, the floor, and even on his clothes. While I thought it was all part of the fun and learning process, my partner was really upset about the mess. They felt that we needed to have stricter rules about art time and thought that I should have been more proactive in managing the situation.

After the first paint session, my partner asked me to sit down with our son and establish some ""art etiquette"" to keep things clean. I agreed, but I also stressed that creativity comes with a bit of chaos, especially at his age. I wanted to find a balance between nurturing his creativity and keeping our home tidy, but I wasn’t sure how strict we should be.

When we tried to implement the new rules, our son was clearly disappointed. He loves painting and I didn’t want him to feel restricted or worry about making a mess. After a few days of trying to enforce the rules, I suggested we approach it differently. Instead of strict boundaries, we could prep the area to make clean-up easier—like laying down old newspapers and wearing old clothes. 

My partner was not thrilled with my suggestion, thinking it would just encourage more mess. We ended up having a bit of a disagreement about how to handle it, with my partner believing I was undermining their authority and I felt that I was just trying to keep our son’s enthusiasm alive.

In the end, we decided to compromise: we would let our son paint freely, but we would also set up a designated space that was easier to clean.

However, I struggle with chronic migraines, which can be triggered by heat and loud noises. I often have to cancel plans last minute when I feel a migraine coming on, and I hate that it impacts my sister and her kids. I’ve been trying to be more present in their lives, but being in crowded places for too long can be overwhelming for me, and I end up feeling guilty when I can’t participate fully.

I love my sister and her kids, and I want to support her, but I’m also concerned that spending an entire day at the park might lead to a migraine for me. I’ve considered going for just a few hours to show my support, but I worry that once I’m there, the noise and excitement might be too much, and I could end up feeling miserable.

I mentioned my concerns to my sister and suggested that maybe I could help with the preparations instead or join them for a smaller gathering later.

Recently, a few of my colleagues started inviting me to after-work outings—dinners, trivia nights, and game sessions. I genuinely appreciate the invitations, but I’ve turned them down each time because I feel drained after work and need that time to recharge. I’ve made sure to decline politely, saying that I’m just not up for socializing after a long day.

One day, a coworker kindly confronted me about my lack of participation. They shared that they really enjoy my company and feel like I’m missing out on building connections outside of work. I took a moment to explain my perspective, reiterating that it’s nothing personal against them. I just truly find my downtime essential for my wellbeing and would rather spend it alone.

After our conversation, I thought it went well, but later I overheard another coworker expressing frustration about my consistent refusals. They felt I was shutting them out and that it affected team spirit.

They’ve hung out a few times, and while he always told me he liked her, he never had the courage to ask her out.

A couple of weekends ago, I went out to a local café and ended up chatting with a girl who turned out to be Emily. I didn’t recognize her at first, and we hit it off immediately. We talked for hours, laughing and sharing stories over coffee. It was honestly one of the best conversations I’ve had in a long time.

Since I didn’t realize she was Tom’s crush at that moment, I said yes without hesitation.

Later that day, I called Tom to tell him about my new plans, and he immediately seemed off. He asked who I was going with, and when I told him it was Emily, he got really quiet.

Tom was upset but also seemed grateful that I was willing to drop my plans. We talked about it for a while, and while he was hurt, he also admitted that he hadn’t made a move on her yet.

When we were searching for apartments, we agreed on having a list of shared rules to make sure we both felt comfortable in our new space.

One of the rules we set was about having guests over. We agreed that we would give each other a heads-up if we were inviting someone over, especially if it was someone staying overnight. This way, we could plan our schedules accordingly and ensure we both had our space.

A few weeks after moving in, my roommate invited a guy over for a weekend without letting me know. I came home unexpectedly early that day and found them in our living room. I didn’t say anything at the moment, but I felt uncomfortable since we agreed to communicate about guests. Later that evening, I brought it up and expressed that I was surprised she didn’t let me know he was coming over, especially since it was a weekend and I had plans to hang out with some friends.

She got defensive and said she didn’t think it was a big deal, and that she wouldn’t have bothered me with a heads-up for just one night. I explained that it wasn’t about the one night, but about our agreement and feeling like we’re in this together.

No one is the Asshole,"I've been friends with Sarah for several years, and we've always supported each other through thick and thin. Recently, Sarah decided to adopt a dog, which she was really excited about. She mentioned wanting to adopt a rescue dog and asked if I could help her out by going with her to the shelter.

I was more than happy to help and went with her to the shelter. When we got there, Sarah quickly fell in love with a lovely mixed-breed puppy named Max. She was really excited and decided to adopt him. I was thrilled for her, but I also noticed that the shelter had a promotion on adopting two dogs for a reduced fee. 

I casually mentioned it to Sarah, suggesting that it might be nice to adopt two dogs so that Max would have a playmate. Sarah paused for a moment and then said she appreciated the suggestion but felt she wasn't ready to take on two dogs at once. I understood and dropped the subject.

A few days later, Sarah called me to tell me she had decided to adopt a second dog after all. She explained that while she initially thought she could only handle one, she had talked it over with her partner and they felt ready for two. I was really happy for her decision and excited to meet both dogs!

When I met the two dogs later, I congratulated her on her new addition and we had a great time. She thanked me for the initial suggestion, saying it helped her think through her options. I felt good about being supportive, but I didn't want to overstep or put any pressure on her.

In the end, I think we both ended up in a good place, and Sarah was grateful for the support. I’m just glad everything worked out for her and her new furry family!",674,627,0.92,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_26545,2022-08-19 00:00:00,NAH,1654,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I (28F) recently hosted a small gathering at my apartment for some close friends to celebrate my birthday. I’ve been planning this for a few weeks, and I wanted it to be a fun, relaxing evening with good food and drinks. I invited six of my friends, and everyone confirmed they would come. 

On the day of the party, I went all out: I cooked a nice dinner, baked a cake, and prepared some cocktails. Everything was going well until a friend, Sarah (29F), showed up about two hours late without any explanation. When she arrived, she immediately began complaining about how she was hungry and didn’t have time to eat before coming.

I had already served dinner, and I let her know there were leftovers in the kitchen if she wanted to help herself. Instead of just enjoying the moment, she made a show of how the food was ""not enough"" and that she hoped I had cake because she was starving. I felt a bit hurt and embarrassed because I had put so much effort into the evening.

After that, I tried to lighten the mood and suggested we play some games, but Sarah continued to sulk and made snarky remarks about the food and how I could have done better. At one point, I jokingly said, “Well, maybe next year I’ll just let you plan it!” to which she rolled her eyes and sarcastically replied, “Yeah, right.”

The rest of the friends seemed uncomfortable, and while they tried to change the subject, I felt like Sarah was ruining the vibe. I didn’t want to escalate things, but I eventually asked her to stop being negative and to try to enjoy the evening. This led to an awkward silence, and she left shortly after. 

My other friends reassured me that I did nothing wrong, but I can’t help but feel bad about how things turned out. I didn’t mean to confront her in front of everyone, but I was just trying to enjoy my birthday. So, am I the asshole for calling her out, or was she out of line?",985,828,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_31825,2023-10-12 00:00:00,NAH,1889,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I’ve been friends with Sarah for years, and we often hang out to watch movies or binge shows together. Recently, she started getting really into this new series that I had already watched and loved. When she invited me over to watch it again with her, I was excited but also a bit nervous because I know she tends to talk a lot during shows, especially when she’s invested in the plot.

So, we settled in, and as soon as the episode started, she began to comment on pretty much every little thing. At first, I tried to enjoy it, but as the episode went on, it became hard to follow the story with her constant chatter. I gently reminded her a couple of times to maybe save the commentary for the end, but she seemed to get even more animated and excited, which made it harder for me to focus.

Finally, I reached a breaking point and asked her if we could just watch it without interruptions for this episode, as I really wanted to enjoy it. She looked hurt and said she was just trying to share her excitement with me, and that I had ruined the mood. I felt bad because I didn’t want to upset her, but I also wanted to enjoy the show without distractions.

In the end, we talked it out, and I apologized for how I handled it. She understood my perspective and said she would try to tone it down next time.

No one is the Asshole,"I (23F) have been living with my aunt (45F) for the past year while I finish my degree. She has been really supportive and has even helped me with tuition, which I’m incredibly grateful for. However, there’s been some tension lately regarding household chores.

My aunt has a busy schedule, often working late, and she does a lot of the major household tasks. I try to help out as much as I can, but I also have classes and part-time work. We usually have a loose agreement where I handle cleaning the common areas, and she takes care of the kitchen and laundry.

Recently, I noticed that the kitchen was getting pretty messy, and it was becoming overwhelming for me to keep up with the cleaning of other areas when I also had to manage that. I mentioned to my aunt that I was feeling stressed about the mess and that I wanted to figure out a way we could divide the chores more evenly, especially since I was spending a lot of time on my studies.

She took this to heart and suggested that we create a cleaning schedule, which I thought was a great idea. We sat down together and came up with a plan that would hold both of us accountable. However, I accidentally made a comment about how I felt like I was doing more than my share, and it seemed to hurt her feelings. I didn’t mean to imply that she wasn’t doing enough; I just wanted to ensure it was fair.

Now, I feel guilty for bringing it up in that way, but I also think it was important to address the issue. I don’t want her to feel unappreciated, but I also want to make sure I’m not overwhelmed with chores.

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been planning to go on a weekend camping trip for months. We were both really looking forward to it, especially since it’s been a while since we had some quality time in nature. However, just a couple of days before the trip, my partner got a last-minute invitation to a family reunion that falls on the same weekend. 

Initially, they felt torn about what to do. They know how much I was looking forward to the camping trip, but they also feel obligated to attend the family reunion since it’s a rare opportunity to see relatives they haven't seen in ages. After talking it through, we decided that my partner would go to the reunion, and I would still go camping, but I would do it solo instead.

I didn’t want to cancel our trip altogether, and I figured it would be a good experience for me to spend some time on my own in nature. My partner completely supported my decision, but I could tell they felt a bit guilty about missing out. I made sure to reassure them that it was okay and that I would take lots of pictures to share with them when I got back.

The day of the trip arrives, and I pack up all my gear and head out to the campsite. I had a great time hiking, fishing, and stargazing, but I also kept texting my partner to keep them updated and share my experiences. They seemed happy for me but also expressed a little sadness about missing it.

After the trip, my partner said they felt bad for not being able to join me and questioned if they made the right choice in going to the reunion instead of camping with me. I told them that it was completely okay and that I understood their need to see family, and I had a fulfilling time on my own.

Now, I’m wondering if I was wrong to still go camping without them or if they should have prioritized our trip over the family reunion. Was I being inconsiderate for going alone when they had to miss out?",515,1518,0.81,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_34075,2023-11-19 00:00:00,NAH,1887,AITA

I had been managing it well, but the thought of camping in the woods with a group of friends was starting to feel overwhelming.

I decided to be open with my friends about my struggles, especially since we would be sharing a tent and spending a lot of time together in close quarters. I explained that I was feeling anxious and would prefer to skip this trip so I could take care of my mental health. I also mentioned that I would love to meet up with them afterward to hear all about their adventures and maybe do something one-on-one.

My friends were understanding but also expressed disappointment since they had planned everything together. They felt like I was abandoning them and it was hard for them to comprehend how serious my anxiety could be. I don’t blame them for their feelings because they genuinely wanted to include me and have a good time together.

I ended up opting out of the trip, focusing instead on self-care and managing my anxiety. I did meet up with them when they returned, and we had a great time sharing stories and looking at pictures.

No one is the Asshole,"So this happened last week, and I'm still trying to figure out if I was in the wrong.

I was at a small gathering at my friend’s house, and everything was going great. We were all having fun, laughing, and enjoying each other's company. At some point, one of the guests, let’s call him Mike, started to drink a bit too much. It was clear he was getting more and more intoxicated, and he started making some inappropriate jokes that made a few people uncomfortable.

I decided to pull him aside and talk to him privately. I told him that while I know he was just trying to be funny, some of his jokes were crossing the line, and it could hurt people's feelings. He seemed to take it well, but a short while later, he went back to making similar jokes to the group, and it was awkward.

After a while, Mike got really loud and started saying some things that were just plain rude about one of the other guests. I thought it would be best to intervene again, so I tried to distract him and steer the conversation away from what he was saying. It worked for a bit, but then he started to argue with me, claiming I was trying to ruin his fun.

Things escalated, and before I knew it, he was shouting at me in front of everyone. I felt really embarrassed, and I told him I thought he needed to cool off. At this point, my friend, the host, stepped in and asked Mike to leave for the night.

Now, Mike hasn't spoken to me since and has been posting passive-aggressive comments on social media about how some people just can't take a joke. I feel bad because I really didn't want to hurt his feelings or ruin the night, but I also think it was important to stand up for the others who were uncomfortable.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I wanted to share my experience with a recent situation I had with a friend, and I’m honestly unsure how I handled it.

I’ve been friends with this guy, Jake, for a few years now. We both love movies and frequently have movie nights where we watch films and just hang out. However, there’s one issue: Jake has a habit of spoiling movies for others. He gets really excited about what he’s seen and tends to reveal major plot points without realizing it can ruin the experience for others.

Recently, we decided to have a movie night at my place. I had picked out a new thriller that I was really looking forward to watching with him. Before we started, I made it clear that I wanted to go into the movie without any spoilers. Jake agreed, but during the movie, I could see him getting fidgety. 

About halfway through, he suddenly blurted out a huge spoiler! I was so frustrated, but instead of blowing up at him, I took a deep breath and tried to talk it out. I explained that I was really looking forward to the twist and would appreciate it if he could be more mindful in the future. He apologized and admitted that he often gets too caught up in his excitement and forgets that not everyone has seen the movie yet.

After that, we finished watching the film. I appreciated that he was willing to acknowledge his mistake, and he even suggested we watch another movie afterward, one that we both hadn’t seen, so we could enjoy it without worrying about spoilers.

In the end, I felt like we both learned something from the experience. I realized that sometimes the best approach is to communicate openly rather than get upset, and he recognized the importance of being considerate of others’ experiences. So, I’m left wondering if I handled it the right way or if I should have reacted differently. What do you think?",63,2170,0.52,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_22775,2022-12-01 00:00:00,NAH,1822,AITA

Lisa has a tendency to get overwhelmed quite easily, and she expressed to me that she was feeling anxious about the project. I tried to reassure her and suggested that we can work together to tackle the remaining tasks efficiently. 

On the day before the deadline, Lisa came to me and asked if I could take the lead on the presentation we needed to prepare for our boss. She said she was feeling too stressed to focus and didn’t want to mess it up. I understood where she was coming from, but I also felt that it wasn’t fair for me to take on all the responsibility at the last minute. I told her that I was more than willing to help her out, but we needed to collaborate on it together so we could both contribute and feel good about it.

Lisa got a bit upset and said that she was just looking for some support, and I felt bad for not being more understanding.

We ended up having a very open conversation about our feelings, and I think we both understood each other better after that.

He’s a really curious kid, always asking questions about everything. Lately, he’s gotten really interested in space and dinosaurs, which makes for some fun conversations.

Last week, while we were hanging out, he brought up the idea of what would happen if he could travel back in time to see dinosaurs. He was super animated, and I thought it would be fun to play along. I jokingly told him that if he ever went back in time, he should be careful because dinosaurs might think he was a tasty snack!

He laughed at this and started asking more about how dinosaurs lived, what they ate, and what kind of snacks they would prefer. I joked with him that maybe they’d like pizza or ice cream, and he got really into it, pretending to serve them food. 

Then, I decided to take it a step further and told him that sometimes, if you think too hard about dinosaurs, they might actually hear you and come to find you. I said that if he kept talking about them, they might think he was challenging them! He looked at me wide-eyed and said, ""What if they really came for me?"" I thought it was hilarious and kept going, saying he needed to protect himself with a ""dinosaur shield.""

At first, he was laughing, but then I noticed he was getting a bit nervous. I immediately realized I might have gone too far, so I quickly reassured him that it was all just a joke and dinosaurs can't come back to life. We both giggled, and I made sure he knew it was all in fun.

However, later on, my mom found out about our conversation and was upset with me. She thought I scared him too much and that it was irresponsible to joke about something that could make him anxious. I felt bad that she was upset, but I also thought it was just playful banter.

My partner, on the other hand, prefers a more spontaneous approach. They like to just pick a destination and go with the flow, leaving a lot of decisions until we arrive, which I find stressful.

We recently planned a week-long trip to Europe, and I took the initiative to create a rough itinerary, which included places I wanted to visit, restaurants to try, and activities based on various interests.

No one is the Asshole,"hi everyone,

throwaway account because this is a delicate matter.

a bit of background: my best friend and I have been inseparable since childhood. We grew up together, sharing everything from our dreams to our struggles. A few months ago, she came to me with a really big request—she wanted me to be her surrogate. She and her husband have been trying to have a baby for years, and after multiple unsuccessful attempts, they turned to IVF. However, it was explained to them that the chances of success were lower due to her health issues.

At first, I was taken aback. I have always been open to the idea of helping my friend, but being a surrogate felt like a massive step. After a lot of soul-searching, I realized I would love to help her, but I also had concerns about the physical and emotional toll it could take on me. I talked to her about my fears, and she was incredibly understanding. 

We spent hours discussing the pros and cons, and ultimately, I decided that while I wanted to support her, I wasn’t in a place to commit to such a significant responsibility. I suggested that she look into other options, like adoption or finding another surrogate, and she took it gracefully, even thanking me for being honest.

We’re still close friends, and while it was a tough conversation, I felt like we both walked away with a better understanding of each other's feelings. I just hope I didn’t hurt her too much by saying no.

Long story short: Sarah and I have a long history of friendship, and we both love reading. After years of talking about it, we finally decided to start a book club with just the two of us. I was really excited and suggested one of my favorite books, a fantasy novel that I've loved for years. However, when Sarah started reading it, she absolutely hated it. She sent me a long message explaining why she found it boring and poorly written, and she was pretty dismissive of my taste.

At first, I tried to brush it off, but I felt really hurt by her comments. It felt like she was attacking something personal to me, given how much I valued that book. I told her that I appreciated her honesty, but it felt unnecessarily harsh. We ended up having a pretty big argument where we both said things we didn’t mean. I expressed that I was disappointed because I thought we could share something I loved, and she felt like I was being defensive and not open to her opinion.

The next day, we both reached out to apologize. I understood that she didn’t mean to hurt me and that not everyone has to love the same things. She also acknowledged that she could have been more tactful in her criticism. We both agreed to pick a different book for our next meeting.

Now I’m left wondering if I overreacted by calling her out on her comments. I know we both care about each other and I value our friendship. Was I wrong to feel hurt, or did I go too far in confronting her? NAH?",203,2180,0.57,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_60566,2019-04-13 00:00:00,NAH,1792,AITA

tldr - My girlfriend is getting frustrated with my gaming habits, and I’m trying to figure out if I’m being inconsiderate.

So I (M26) have been with my girlfriend (F25) for about two years now, and we recently moved in together about three months ago. I’ve always been a huge fan of video games, and my girlfriend knew this before we moved in. I’ve got a pretty regular schedule — I work full-time and usually game in the evenings after dinner, which is something I enjoy to unwind.

The issue started about a month ago when my girlfriend mentioned that she felt neglected because I was spending a lot of time gaming instead of hanging out with her. I totally understand where she’s coming from; it’s easy to get lost in a game and forget about the time. So, I made a point to set aside some time in the evenings for us to watch a show or just hang out together.

However, I also still enjoy my gaming time, and it’s a big part of my routine. Recently, she’s started making comments about how I seem more enthusiastic about gaming than spending quality time with her, which has made me feel a bit guilty. I genuinely try to balance both, but sometimes I feel like I’m being pulled in two directions.

I want to make sure she feels valued and appreciated, but I also don’t want to feel like I have to sacrifice my hobbies entirely. I’ve tried to communicate this to her, but she still seems frustrated. I’m just wondering if I’m being inconsiderate in how I’m managing my time and if I should be doing more to accommodate her feelings.

A few weeks ago, she invited me over to help her with a new recipe she wanted to film for her blog. I thought it would be a fun way to spend time together, so I agreed.

I expressed my concerns about the taste and if I’d even enjoy it, hoping she would consider making something we both liked.

She insisted that I give it a try and said it would help me adopt healthier eating habits. While I appreciate her intentions, I felt uncomfortable with the pressure to conform to her dietary preferences. I ended up trying a small bite, but I couldn’t hide my disgust. I told her honestly that it wasn’t for me, and she seemed really disappointed.

However, I've recently gotten really into meal prepping and trying to eat healthier, while my friend prefers more indulgent recipes and spontaneous cooking sessions.

One day, I invited her over for a cooking session. I was excited to share some of my meal prep ideas, but I realized quickly that she wasn't really into it. Instead of expressing her disinterest directly, she started making comments about how “boring” meal prep is and how it takes the fun out of cooking.

Our cooking session ended up being awkward, and she left without really engaging with any of the ideas I had.

I felt a bit guilty afterward because I didn’t want to hurt her feelings, but at the same time, I wanted her to understand that it’s okay to have different preferences.

No one is the Asshole,"My best friend and I have been inseparable since childhood. We share everything, from secrets to dreams, and we have a tradition of cooking together every Saturday. Recently, he started dating someone new, and while I was excited for him, I noticed that he seemed to be spending less time with me and more with her.

Last week, I suggested we cook together as usual, and he told me he had plans with her instead. I understood, but I felt a bit left out and disappointed. So, I decided to invite a few other friends over for a cooking night to keep the tradition alive, but I didn't mention it to him right away.

When I finally told him about the cooking night, he seemed hurt and accused me of trying to replace him. I reassured him that wasn’t my intention; I just wanted to keep the tradition going. He ended up coming over, and we had a great time together. I realized we both care about our friendship, but it's just evolving as our lives change.

I apologized for not communicating better, and he acknowledged that he needed to balance his time better too. It was a good conversation, and we both walked away feeling more connected.

No one is the Asshole,"So my best friend and I have been inseparable since we were kids. We’ve always supported each other through thick and thin, but lately, things have been a bit tense. 

A few months ago, she got engaged to her long-time boyfriend, and while I was over the moon for her, it brought up some complicated feelings for me. I’ve been single for a while now and have struggled with dating. Seeing her plan her wedding has been a bittersweet experience for me; I’m genuinely happy for her, but it also makes me feel left out and a bit envious. 

I’ve tried to be supportive, attending all the bridal events and helping her with planning. But every time we hang out, it seems like the conversation always shifts back to her wedding plans, and I find myself feeling more and more overwhelmed. I don’t want to hurt her feelings or seem unsupportive, but I also don’t know how to express what I’m feeling without sounding selfish.

Recently, we were out for coffee, and she excitedly started discussing the guest list. I felt the tears welling up because all I could think about was my own struggles with relationships and how I might never have the chance to experience that excitement myself. I managed to hold it together, but afterward, I felt like I needed to talk to her about how her wedding planning was affecting me.

I want her to know I’m happy for her, but I also want to ask if we could maybe talk about other things sometimes or at least balance the conversation. I know she’s in a really special place right now, and I don’t want to dim her joy, but I also don’t want to continue feeling this way.

So, am I the asshole for considering bringing this up with her? I just want to maintain our friendship without feeling this pang of jealousy and sadness every time we meet.",420,992,0.87,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_22833,2023-03-25 00:00:00,NAH,1773,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I (30f) have a close friend, Sarah (29f), who has a son, Lucas (5), with autism. Sarah and I have been friends for years, and I genuinely care about both her and Lucas. I know that social situations can sometimes be challenging for him, so I always try to be understanding when we get together.

Recently, I decided to host a small dinner party at my house, inviting a few close friends, including Sarah and Lucas. I love cooking and wanted to create a warm atmosphere for our gathering. Before the party, I reached out to Sarah to discuss how we could make it comfortable for Lucas. I suggested that if he needed some quiet time, we could set up a small area in another room with his favorite toys and a few activities to help him feel at ease.

On the day of the party, everything was going well at first. However, as the evening progressed, Lucas started feeling overwhelmed by all the noise and activity. Sarah tried her best to manage the situation, but it became clear that he was getting more anxious. I could see that she was struggling too, and I felt for both of them.

After a while, Lucas had a bit of a meltdown, and I immediately suggested that they take a break and spend some time in the quiet room I had prepared. I offered to bring some snacks and activities in there for them, so Lucas could have a more relaxed experience while still being part of the evening.

Sarah, however, seemed quite upset. She felt that my suggestion to separate them was implying that Lucas needed to be ""fixed"" or that he was a burden. I reassured her that wasn’t my intention; I just wanted to create an environment where he could feel safe and comfortable. We ended up having a heart-to-heart conversation about it, and I learned more about her perspective as a parent of a child with autism.

In the end, they took a break, and after some time, Lucas was able to come back out and rejoin us for dessert, happier and calmer. It was a learning experience for both me and Sarah, and I felt relieved that we were able to communicate openly about it. We ended the night on good terms, but I still worry that I might have upset her.

We all get along pretty well, and we have an unspoken agreement to keep our shared spaces tidy. Recently, I started a new job that requires me to work long hours, often leaving me exhausted in the evenings.

Last week, I came home after a particularly grueling day and noticed that the kitchen was a mess. Dishes were piled up in the sink, crumbs were all over the counter, and there were food containers left out. I felt overwhelmed and frustrated, especially since I had been the one to clean up after everyone the last few times. I decided to leave a note on the fridge, gently reminding my roommates of our agreement to keep the common areas clean.

The next day, one of my roommates approached me and said she felt hurt by the note. She explained that she’s been dealing with some personal issues and hasn’t been able to keep up with cleaning. I didn’t know about her situation and I felt bad for not considering that before leaving the note. I apologized and let her know that I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings, and I offered to help her out for a while until she feels better.

We ended up having a good conversation about how we can all support each other and share the cleaning responsibilities more fairly.

No one is the Asshole,"A few months ago, I had the opportunity to take a short-term job in another city for about three months. I was excited about the chance to gain some new experience and enhance my resume. However, it meant I would need to temporarily sublet my apartment. 

I reached out to a couple of friends who were looking for a place to stay for a bit, and my friend Sarah expressed interest. We’ve known each other for years, but we weren’t super close. Still, I trusted her and thought it would be a good arrangement since she had a steady job and needed a place to stay for a few months. 

Before departing, we agreed on a sublet price that was a bit lower than what I normally paid for rent, but I wanted to help her out since she was in a tight spot. I thought it would be a win-win situation. 

While I was away, I kept in touch with Sarah to check in on how things were going. A few weeks into my new job, I noticed that my roommates back home were frequently posting pictures on social media of parties happening at my apartment. I felt a bit uneasy about it since I had explicitly told Sarah that I would prefer if she kept things low-key while I was away. 

I confronted Sarah about it, and while she acknowledged my concerns, she mentioned that she felt like she was just trying to enjoy the space and make the most out of her time there. She said that she thought it was normal to have friends over every so often, and that she didn’t see the harm in it. I understood where she was coming from but felt that she ignored my request.

Eventually, after some back and forth, I decided to let it go since I didn’t want to ruin our friendship. I also realized that she was paying rent and had the right to enjoy her living space. When I returned, the place was a bit messier than I would have liked, but it was still in decent shape. 

Looking back, I feel like both of us had valid points. I wanted to maintain my space, while she wanted to feel at home. So, was I wrong to ask her to minimize gatherings, or was she wrong for having them anyway? AITA?",99,2905,0.72,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_63362,2019-02-10 00:00:00,NAH,2048,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, a few weeks ago, my friend had a small gathering for his birthday. He invited a close group of friends over to celebrate, and I was really looking forward to it. The plan was to have some food, drinks, and games, which sounded like a perfect way to spend the evening.

On the day of the party, I offered to bring some snacks and drinks, as I often do when we hang out. My friend said that would be great, so I picked up a couple of bags of chips, some dips, and a few bottles of soda. When I arrived, I noticed that things were a bit chaotic; my friend had underestimated the time it would take to get everything ready, and he was stressed out trying to set up. 

As the night went on, I could see that a few of our friends were also feeling the pressure to help out, so we all pitched in to help him get things sorted. I handled setting up the drinks and snacks while others helped with decorations and organizing games. We managed to lighten the mood and made it a fun atmosphere.

However, as the evening progressed, I noticed that one of our friends, Jamie, seemed to be in a bad mood. She was often quiet and kind of snappy when people tried to involve her in games. At one point, I asked her if she was okay because she looked upset. She snapped back that she was fine, but her tone made it clear that she was not fine at all. I didn’t want to push her, so I gave her space.

Later on, while we were playing games, Jamie made a comment about how she didn’t think the party was fun at all and that she could have done better. This comment rubbed a few people the wrong way, including me, but I tried to brush it off. I didn't want to escalate anything, especially since it was my friend's birthday.

As the night wrapped up, Jamie brought up how she felt like she was being ignored and that she wanted to leave early. I apologized for not including her in the games more but explained that we were just caught up in the fun. I also mentioned that everyone was welcome to join in and that it was meant to be a light-hearted gathering.

Jamie ended up leaving in a huff, and I felt bad because I genuinely didn’t want her to feel left out. After the party, I texted my friend to see how he felt about everything. He said it was a great night overall, but he did mention that Jamie had come to him afterward complaining that she felt excluded and that it ""wasn’t a real party.""

Now I'm wondering if I should have done more to include her or if I was right to focus on making the birthday celebration enjoyable for everyone else.

A few weeks ago, she invited me to a party, and I was excited to go. I knew a lot of her friends would be there, and I was looking forward to catching up with everyone. On the day of the party, I decided to bring a homemade dessert as a contribution, since my friend loves my baking. I made a chocolate cake that I thought everyone would enjoy.

When I arrived at the party, it was packed, and I set my cake down on the food table, all wrapped up and looking nice. As the night went on, I noticed some people were digging into the other snacks and treats, but I didn't see anyone eating my cake. I figured it might be because they needed time to get to it, so I didn’t think much of it.

Later in the evening, my friend pulled me aside and told me that she overheard some guests saying they wouldn't try my cake because they thought it looked “too homemade” and didn’t seem appealing. I was a bit taken aback because I had put a lot of effort into it, and I really wanted everyone to enjoy it.

Feeling a mix of disappointment and a bit of embarrassment, I decided to leave the party early. I texted my friend the next day, thanking her for the invite and letting her know I felt a bit hurt by the comments. She was really understanding and even apologized for not talking to me sooner about it. She didn't think the cake was bad at all, but she felt bad that others were being judgmental.

One of my cousins brought up how we used to play pranks on each other, and it turned into a lighthearted competition about who could pull off the best prank. I jokingly suggested that I would start throwing water balloons at people during the next family reunion for a laugh.

My cousin then said, “You know, throwing water balloons could be seen as a bit childish and maybe even annoying to some of the adults.” I laughed it off, thinking he was just being overly cautious. However, he continued to emphasize that we should be more respectful of everyone’s preferences and not disrupt the gathering with something so silly.

Later, during dinner, another cousin chimed in, agreeing with him and suggesting that while pranks can be fun, we should be mindful of the atmosphere and try to keep things more mature. I felt a bit defensive because I thought we were just having fun and that it wouldn’t hurt anyone.

I told them that I understood their perspective but that I didn’t think it was going to ruin the gathering if we had a bit of fun. They both clarified that they weren’t trying to ruin anyone’s good time; they just wanted to respect the different vibes people bring to family events.

A couple of weeks ago, my roommate went out of town for a weekend, and I kindly offered to take care of her dog while she was away. I thought it would be a good way to help her out and maybe bond a little more with the dog, who I’d gotten to know over the year. 

The first day went smoothly, and I took the dog for walks and played with him. However, on the second day, I noticed the dog seemed a little off. He wasn’t interested in eating and was more lethargic than usual. I decided to take him to the vet just to be safe, and they discovered he had a mild stomach issue that needed treatment.

I called my roommate to let her know what was going on, and she was understandably concerned. She asked me if I could stay with the dog for the next couple of days until she returned so that I could give him the medication and keep an eye on him. I agreed, but I also mentioned that I had made plans for the following weekend and would need to leave town. 

When my roommate returned, she was really grateful for my help, but she seemed upset when I told her I’d have to leave for the weekend. I explained that I had commitments I couldn’t back out of. She said she felt let down that I wouldn’t be around to help her with the dog now that he was sick. 

I totally understand her frustration, but I also felt like I had done my part in taking care of her dog and getting him the help he needed. We had a pretty awkward conversation afterward, where I felt like I was being blamed for not being able to stay and help more.

Sarah has a beautiful flower garden that she takes great pride in, and I often help her with some of the heavy lifting and planting.

Recently, I decided to take up a new hobby: making homemade herbal teas. I’ve been experimenting with different herbs and flowers from my own garden and wanted to share my creations with Sarah as a thank you for her friendship and support. I thought it'd be a nice gesture to give her some of my herbal tea blends. 

I made a batch of chamomile and lavender tea and went over to Sarah’s house to surprise her. I knocked on her door, and when she opened it, I excitedly presented the tea. However, I noticed that she seemed a bit taken aback. She thanked me but then explained that she had just started a new diet that excluded all forms of caffeine and herbal teas for the next few months to help her with some health issues. She clearly appreciated the gesture but mentioned she wouldn’t be able to enjoy the tea.

No one is the Asshole,"The backstory: My partner and I have been together for a few years, and we both have really busy schedules. We try to make time for each other, but life often gets in the way. Recently, we both decided that we needed to prioritize our relationship and set aside one night a week for a ""date night"" where we could spend quality time together.

We planned our first date night and were both excited about it. I suggested we try a new restaurant that just opened up in town, and my partner agreed. However, the day before our date, my partner received an unexpected work email that required immediate attention and could not be postponed. It was a big project that could affect their job security, and my partner felt it was important to address it right away.

When my partner brought up the situation with me, I understood the importance of their work but felt disappointed. I had been looking forward to our date night for weeks. In an attempt to lighten the mood, I jokingly said, ""Well, I guess I’m just not as important as your job!"" My partner laughed it off, but I could tell they felt guilty.

Later that day, I realized I wasn’t being fair. My partner works hard, and I appreciate everything they do for us. I called them and said, ""You know what? I completely understand that work comes first sometimes. Let's reschedule our date night. I just want you to feel good about getting this done without any guilt.""

We ended up rescheduling our date for the following weekend, and we had a fantastic time at the restaurant and a great conversation about work-life balance. It brought us closer, and I could see how relieved my partner felt.

So, AITA for initially expressing disappointment but then recognizing that my partner's work responsibilities came first and supporting their decision? I just want to make sure I’m being understanding while still valuing our time together. Thanks for reading!",518,2040,0.77,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_94756,2022-09-10 00:00:00,NAH,1904,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I'm a 28-year-old woman, and I recently moved to a new city for work. I've been trying to make new friends, and I met a group of people through a local book club. We've been hanging out regularly, and it's been great to connect over our shared love of reading.

Last week, one of the members, Sarah, invited everyone over for a dinner party. I was excited to go, but I had just started a new diet and was feeling a bit self-conscious about eating in front of others, especially since some of them have been very vocal about their fitness journeys. I decided to bring a healthy dish to share, hoping it would blend in with the menu and help me feel more comfortable.

When I arrived, I noticed that the other dishes were quite indulgent—lots of rich casseroles and desserts. During dinner, someone made a comment about the healthy dish I brought, saying, ""Oh, so you’re on one of those diets?"" It felt a bit judgmental, but I shrugged it off. I tried to joke about it, saying I was just trying to balance things out.

As the night went on, I noticed Sarah seemed a bit distant and was hardly engaging in conversation. I later found out from another member that she felt hurt because she had put a lot of effort into the dinner and thought my dish implied that I didn't appreciate her cooking. I genuinely didn't mean to offend anyone; I just wanted to bring something I felt comfortable eating.

Now I'm feeling torn. I didn't intend to upset anyone, but I also wanted to be true to my own goals. I really like this group and want to continue building friendships. Am I the asshole for bringing a healthy dish to a dinner party, or was it just a misunderstanding?",720,2666,0.95,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_62762,2020-05-03 00:00:00,NAH,1662,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, I (25F) have always had a complicated relationship with my parents. Growing up, my dad was very strict and my mom was often emotionally unavailable, which left me and my younger brother feeling pretty neglected. Fast forward to now, and my brother and I are both trying to build our own lives, but we still have to deal with family gatherings that are often tense.

Recently, my brother and I decided to host a small get-together for our friends, and we invited our parents out of obligation. We made it clear it would only be a casual event with a few people. The day of the gathering, my parents showed up unannounced with a bunch of their friends, turning our small event into a full-blown party. It completely overwhelmed us and our friends, who were expecting a chill night.

I expressed to my parents how this wasn’t what we had in mind, and that it would be better if they kept it low-key. This turned into a big argument, and ultimately, they left in a huff. It was awkward and I felt bad for the way things turned out, but I also felt like I had the right to set boundaries for my own event.

Afterwards, my brother and I talked about it and both agreed that we didn’t want to hurt our parents’ feelings, but we also needed to prioritize our own comfort. We called them later to apologize for the confrontation but also reiterated our need for them to respect our space in the future.

I’m feeling conflicted about whether I was too harsh with my parents or if it was fair for us to ask for what we wanted. AITA for wanting to have my own space and boundaries, even if it upset my parents?",534,826,0.53,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_24509,2020-11-17 00:00:00,NAH,1602,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, I (16F) have been really passionate about art for as long as I can remember. Painting, sketching, you name it—it's my escape and my way of expressing myself. My dad, however, is a strong believer in the idea that art isn’t a ""real"" career, and he constantly pushes me toward more traditional fields like engineering or business, which honestly doesn't interest me at all.

Recently, he signed me up for a summer internship at a local engineering firm without even asking me. When I found out, I was really upset. I appreciated that he wanted to give me opportunities, but I felt like my passion for art was being completely disregarded. I tried to explain to him how important art is to me and how I want to pursue a career in it, but he kept insisting that I need to be practical and that I should be considering other options.

In a moment of frustration, I told him that I didn’t want to be forced into a career that didn’t make me happy. He ended up getting really defensive and said that he was just trying to help me succeed and that I was being ungrateful. I truly didn't mean to hurt him, but I felt like my voice was being ignored.

After some back and forth, we both took a step back and had a heart-to-heart. He shared his own fears about the instability in art careers, and I opened up about how my art makes me feel fulfilled. We both apologized for how we handled things, and we reached a compromise where I could explore my passion for art while he would help me look for ways to make it a viable career.

TL;DR: My dad signed me up for an engineering internship without asking, and we had a disagreement about my career choice, but we ended up resolving it through honest conversation.",895,1947,0.64,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_36368,2018-02-16 00:00:00,NAH,1705,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"A little backstory: my partner and I have been planning a vacation with my brother and his girlfriend for a few months now. We all agreed on a fun beach destination, and I was really looking forward to spending quality time together.

As the trip approached, my brother's girlfriend started suggesting a ton of activities that were all quite expensive—like fancy dinners, boat rentals, and a few extravagant excursions. While I understand wanting to have fun, my partner and I are on a tight budget, and spending that kind of money wasn't feasible for us. We suggested some more affordable alternatives, like cooking meals together or enjoying free beach activities, but she wasn’t very receptive to those ideas.

We had a conversation about it, and I honestly thought we were on the same page. However, a few days later, my brother called me and said that she'd been talking to him about us being “too cheap” and that she was worried our budget concerns would ruin the trip. It felt hurtful because we were just trying to find a balance that worked for everyone. 

Then, I had a chat with my partner, and we both agreed it might be best to step back from the trip if it was going to cause so much tension. We decided to let my brother know we wouldn’t be joining them if the focus stayed on expensive outings. It wasn’t an easy decision, but I felt it was better to avoid conflict and preserve our budget.

When I told my brother, he seemed disappointed but understood our reasons. I felt bad because I wanted to spend time with them, but I didn’t want to feel pressured into spending money I didn’t have. Now, there's been a bit of awkwardness, and my brother's girlfriend seems upset with the situation. 

So, am I the Asshole for dropping out of the trip due to budget concerns and trying to maintain harmony?

No one is the Asshole,"I recently had a disagreement with my partner about how to handle a family gathering. My partner's family tends to be quite loud and boisterous, which I often find overwhelming. When we were discussing the upcoming event, I expressed my concerns about feeling anxious in such chaotic environments. I mentioned that I might need to take breaks during the event to recharge.

My partner got frustrated with me, saying that I was being negative and that it was important for us to be present and enjoy the time with family. I understood where they were coming from, but I also felt that my feelings were valid and that I needed some space to cope.

I said to my partner, “I’m not trying to bring down the mood, but it’s hard for me to handle these situations without feeling overwhelmed. I want to be there, but I need to take care of myself too.” 

My partner replied, “I get that, but can’t you at least try to be more positive about this? It’s family time, and it means a lot to me.” I explained that it’s not about being negative; it’s about finding a balance that allows me to enjoy the time without feeling completely drained.

After a bit of back-and-forth, we both realized that we were just trying to communicate our needs in different ways. We ended up agreeing that I could take breaks if needed and that my partner would support me during the gathering.

No one is the Asshole,"I need some perspective on a situation with my partner and our friends that’s been bothering me.

My partner and I have a close-knit group of friends, and we often have game nights at our place. Recently, we decided to host a themed game night where everyone would dress up as their favorite character from a video game. We thought it would be a fun way to bring everyone together and add some excitement.

I got really into the planning and made a big deal about the theme. I decorated our living room, set up some awesome snacks, and even created a playlist of video game music. I was really excited to see how everyone would participate, especially since some of our friends are known for their creativity.

On the day of the event, most of our friends showed up dressed up, and it was fantastic! But one of our friends, let's call him Jake, came in casual clothes and said he didn't think dressing up was a big deal. I felt a bit deflated, especially since everyone else had put in the effort. I didn’t say anything at the time, though.

During the night, I could tell Jake was a bit distant, and when I asked if he was enjoying the event, he mentioned that he felt left out because he didn’t dress up. I realized then that he must have felt uncomfortable and that my excitement might have inadvertently made him feel bad for not participating.

After the night ended, I reached out to him to apologize if I made him feel unwelcome or left out. He appreciated the message and said it was all good, but I still feel bad about it. It wasn’t my intention at all to make him feel that way.

I’m now wondering if I should have handled the situation differently or maybe not made such a big deal out of the theme in the first place.

My cousin, who I thought would find it funny, looked visibly uncomfortable and asked me to stop. I didn’t realize it at first, but she later told me that she had a really tough time with our childhood and felt embarrassed about some of our antics. I apologized right away, saying I didn’t mean to make her uncomfortable and that I was just trying to share a funny memory. 

After the initial awkwardness, we talked it out a little more, and I learned that she had been struggling with some self-esteem issues stemming from our childhood and that my story hit a nerve for her. I felt bad for not being more sensitive and tried to support her after that.

He tends to dominate conversations and can be quite loud, and I could see that Sarah was struggling to manage the situation. At one point, while he was in the middle of a story, I could see her trying to steer the conversation in a different direction to give herself a break.

Feeling sympathetic, I jumped in and tried to change the topic to something lighter, but my friend's brother took it as a cue to shut me down, insisting that his story was more interesting. This led to an awkward back-and-forth, and I could see Sarah getting more anxious.

After a while, I pulled Sarah aside and asked if she was okay and if she needed any help. She confided that she was feeling overwhelmed and wished her brother would tone it down. I suggested that maybe she could ask him to keep it quieter, but she was hesitant, worried that it would upset him. 

In the end, we decided to approach her brother together. Sarah expressed her feelings, and he apologized, realizing he had been a bit much. The rest of the night was much more relaxed after that.

Mia asked me to help her coordinate the party, which I gladly agreed to. We spent hours planning everything, from the guest list to the decorations. The only problem was that Jake had recently mentioned wanting to go out to dinner with a few friends on his birthday, and we were worried he might choose that night for his plans.

Jake laughed and assured me he’d keep his schedule open, but I immediately felt guilty for even hinting at the party. I told Mia what happened, and she was a bit worried I might have ruined the surprise. We decided to stick to our plan and just hope Jake wouldn’t figure it out.

But as the months passed, I noticed he was canceling our plans more often. He’d say he was too busy with work or that he had plans with his girlfriend. One time, he even bailed on my birthday celebration to go to a concert with her. I tried to be understanding, but it stung, especially since I’d always been there for him.

I started to feel a bit neglected and lonely. I reached out to him to express how I was feeling, not out of anger but more out of a desire to reconnect. He apologized and said he didn’t mean to make me feel that way, but it’s been tough for him to juggle everything. I get it—it’s hard to balance a new relationship with friendships.

Now, here’s the dilemma: I’m considering cutting back on how much I reach out to him. I don’t want to seem needy or desperate, but I also feel like I deserve more than just an occasional text or invite. At the same time, I know he’s caught up in this new relationship and trying to make it work. I genuinely don’t want to come off as bitter or resentful, but I also don’t want to keep putting myself out there if it’s one-sided.

So, would I be the asshole for pulling back and letting things naturally fade with him, or is it just part of life that friendships change?",268,2241,0.66,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_39066,2020-04-13 00:00:00,NAH,1689,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So my sibling and I have a tradition of going on a camping trip together every summer. We've been doing this for over a decade, and it's become a special time for us to reconnect and enjoy the outdoors. This year, we were planning to go to a beautiful national park that we both love.

As we were making plans, my sibling mentioned that they wanted to bring their new partner along. I was a bit surprised since we’ve always treated this trip as our time together, just the two of us. I was concerned that adding a third person might change the dynamic of our trip, and I told my sibling this. They understood my feelings but really wanted their partner to come, as they felt it would be a fun experience for everyone.

After thinking about it, I decided I could be open to the idea, but I suggested that we have a day set aside just for the two of us, too. My sibling agreed, and we planned for the first couple of days to be just us and then introduce their partner for the latter part of the trip. 

When we finally went camping, the first two days were amazing. We hiked, reminisced about old times, and really enjoyed our sibling bond. However, when their partner joined us, I felt a little sidelined. It seemed like my sibling was more focused on their partner and didn’t engage with me as much as before. 

I tried to embrace the situation, but I found myself feeling somewhat resentful. After a few days, I expressed to my sibling that I felt a little left out and nostalgic for our one-on-one time. They apologized and assured me that it was never their intention to make me feel that way. 

We had a long discussion about balancing our special time and including their partner, and we both agreed to communicate more openly about our feelings in the future. 

So, Reddit, was I the asshole for feeling a bit neglected during our trip after my sibling invited their partner, or was it a normal reaction considering our history?",272,2827,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_84597,2020-09-28 00:00:00,NAH,1935,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I’m a 28-year-old woman, and my younger brother, who is 24, recently graduated from college. He worked incredibly hard and even received a scholarship that covered a significant portion of his tuition. My parents were very supportive, and they helped him with living expenses during his studies.

With graduation came the inevitable family celebration. My parents wanted to throw a big party for him, and I was all in to help. However, my brother has always been a bit of a loner and isn't particularly fond of large gatherings. He expressed to me in private that he was really overwhelmed by the idea of a big event and would prefer something more intimate with just close friends and family.

After discussing it with him, I decided to talk to my parents about scaling back the party. I explained that while I understood their enthusiasm, it might be better to have a more low-key get-together that aligns with what my brother wants. My parents were initially disappointed but agreed to consider it.

The day of the party, they ended up inviting a lot of extended family and friends anyway, despite our conversation. When my brother saw how many people were there, he became visibly anxious and upset. He felt like his wishes had been completely disregarded.

During the party, I gently pulled my parents aside and reiterated my brother's feelings, urging them to be more mindful of his comfort. This led to a bit of a heated discussion where my parents felt I was being ungrateful and that they were trying to celebrate his achievements. I reassured them that I appreciated their intentions, but it was about honoring my brother's preferences too.

In the end, the party went on as planned, and my brother managed to get through it, but he didn’t enjoy it as much as he could have. My parents felt hurt that their efforts weren’t appreciated, and my brother felt overwhelmed.

Now I'm left wondering if I was in the wrong for trying to advocate for my brother and if my parents were justified in wanting to celebrate his accomplishments in the way they thought was best. What do you think?",837,1323,0.5,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_14005,2023-06-29 00:00:00,NAH,2092,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I'm going to keep this brief. A few weeks ago, my best friend and I were planning a surprise birthday party for another mutual friend. We wanted it to be a fun event without stressing out the birthday person. We both agreed on a theme, a guest list, and decided to keep it low-key.

On the day of the party, I was in charge of decorations, while my friend was supposed to handle the food. I bought a bunch of decorations and spent my afternoon setting everything up. When it was time for the guests to arrive, I noticed my friend was running late. I texted her, and she said she was stuck in traffic, but she would be there soon.

As the guests started to arrive, I realized my friend never made it with the food. I had thought she would have planned for that, but it turns out she underestimated how long it would take. I felt a bit overwhelmed managing everything on my own. I decided to ask one of the guests if they could help me, and they were great about pitching in. 

When my friend finally arrived, she was apologetic but clearly stressed. She had brought some snacks, but they were nowhere near the amount we had agreed on. I could see that she felt bad, and rather than getting upset, I tried to reassure her that it was okay and we could work with what we had. The party turned out really well in the end, and everyone had a great time, including our birthday friend.

Afterwards, we talked about the hiccup, and I let her know I appreciated her efforts, even if things didn’t go exactly as planned. We both agreed that it was a learning experience for next time.

As the trip approached, one of my friends, Sarah, mentioned that she has a severe nut allergy. I assured her that we would be careful, and I made a point to avoid bringing any snacks containing nuts. However, when we arrived at the campsite, I noticed that some of the other friends had brought foods that contained nuts, completely unintentionally.

When Sarah saw the nut-containing snacks, she became visibly upset. I tried to reassure her that we would keep her safe and that I would make sure to set aside separate food for her. I suggested that we all eat dinner together, but she felt uncomfortable and chose to eat alone at her tent. Later that night, things escalated when she confronted me about not being more vigilant about the food choices. I felt defensive because I had put a lot of effort into planning the trip and had tried to accommodate her needs, but I also understood her frustration.

So, for our anniversary, I decided to treat my partner to a special dinner at a really nice restaurant that we've both wanted to try for a while. I had been saving up some extra money from my side gig over the past few months, and I thought it would be a great way to celebrate our relationship. I made the reservation and even planned a little surprise by picking them up from work and taking them straight to the restaurant.

When we arrived, my partner seemed excited but also a bit taken aback when they saw the menu prices. As we were ordering, they expressed their concern about how much we were spending, and I reassured them that it was a special occasion and I had saved for this. However, they seemed uncomfortable throughout the meal, and I could tell they were worried about our usual budget.

After dinner, we talked about it, and my partner explained that while they appreciated the gesture, they felt guilty about the money being spent. They mentioned that they would have preferred a more low-key evening that didn't put any strain on our finances. I understood where they were coming from and didn't want to make them feel bad about my surprise.

We ended up having a good conversation about our financial goals and agreed that we should be on the same page when it comes to spending on special occasions. It was a learning experience for both of us, and we decided to plan our next celebration together.

A few days before the event, one of my friends, Sarah, messaged me to say that her partner had come down with a cold, and while she wasn't showing symptoms, she didn't want to risk spreading anything just in case. She asked if it would be okay for her to skip this month’s game night. I completely understood her concern and told her it was totally fine if she wanted to sit this one out.

As the game night approached, I couldn’t help but feel a little bummed that she wouldn’t be there, especially since she usually brings a lot of energy and laughter to our gatherings. On the day of the event, I decided to do a virtual call with her to include her in the fun a bit. I set up my laptop at the table and we had her on video chat while we played our games. It felt nice to have her there, even if she was just on the screen.

However, during the night, a couple of my friends mentioned that they felt weird about having her on the call while we were all together. They thought it might make her feel more excluded instead of included. After hearing this, I felt conflicted. I wanted to include her, but I also didn’t want to make my other friends uncomfortable.

In the end, I kept her on the call for a few games, but I made sure to check in with her about how she was feeling and we decided it was best to wrap it up after a bit, so she didn’t feel like she was just a spectator for the entire night while we were all in person.

Recently, I've noticed that he has been playing music really loudly in the evenings, especially on weekends. At first, I didn’t mind too much, but it’s started to disrupt my study time, and I’ve had a few late-night assignments that I’ve struggled to focus on because of the noise.

So, I decided to have a friendly conversation with him. I approached him and said, “Hey, I’ve noticed that the music has been a bit loud lately, and it’s been hard for me to concentrate on my studies. Would you mind turning it down a bit during the week?” He was really understanding and said he didn’t realize it was bothering me. We ended up agreeing on a compromise; he would keep the volume down during the week, and if he wanted to have a music night on the weekends, I’d just let him know if it got too loud.

Since then, he’s been great about it, and I’m really happy we talked it out. I also make sure to let him play his music at a reasonable volume when I'm not studying. I feel like we both handled the situation well, but I’m just curious if I came off as too demanding or if I handled it in a good way. Am I the asshole for asking him to turn down his music?

A week before the trip, my friend called me and mentioned that she was really tight on cash and would struggle to pay for her share of the camping fees. 

I completely understood; times are tough, and I've been there myself, so I suggested that I would cover her part this time, and she could pay me back when she was in a better position financially. I thought this would help her enjoy the trip without the stress of money hanging over her head.

However, she seemed a bit uncomfortable with the arrangement, saying she didn't want to owe me money and that she would feel awkward about it during the trip. I tried to reassure her that it was no big deal and that I really wanted her to come along since we had been looking forward to this for so long. 

After some back and forth, she agreed to come but insisted on paying for all the food and drinks during the trip as a way to balance things out. I was okay with that, but I think she was still feeling a bit guilty.

I moved into my grandma's house, which is a cozy little place, but it’s also quite small. My grandma is pretty independent, but she does need help with cooking and some daily tasks. The thing is, since I’ve moved in, I’ve noticed that my grandma has a habit of waking up very early, like around 5 AM. She likes to start her day with her routine of making breakfast and watching her favorite shows on TV, which is fine, but the volume is pretty high, and the sound carries throughout the house.

I’ve tried earplugs and sleeping with a white noise machine, but nothing seems to drown out the early morning sounds. I’ve been feeling really exhausted and it’s affecting my ability to focus on my work-from-home job.

I play guitar and write songs, and I’ve dreamed of starting my own band since I was a kid. Recently, I finally gathered enough courage to ask a few friends to join me in forming a band.

However, there’s one friend, Jake, who is a really talented drummer, but he also tends to be quite critical. During our first couple of practice sessions, he would point out every little mistake we made, which made everyone noticeably tense. I get that constructive criticism is part of growing as musicians, but it started to feel more like he was tearing us down rather than helping us improve.

One day, after a particularly rough practice, I called a quick meeting to talk about how we could better support each other. I wanted us to feel comfortable making mistakes and learning together. I suggested we need a more positive atmosphere, and everyone nodded in agreement. But Jake got defensive and said that he was just trying to help us be better. I could see that he felt attacked, even though that wasn’t my intention.

After that conversation, things felt awkward. I wanted us to be a supportive team, but I also didn’t want to stifle Jake's input since he is very talented. I tried to find a balance, but in subsequent practices, I noticed that he seemed less engaged and often showed up late. I started to feel guilty that maybe I was the one who pushed him away by suggesting changes.

We didn’t have an issue with Mike; he’s a nice guy, but we hadn’t extended an invitation because we were keeping things small.

Mike seemed to take it upon himself to be the life of the party, and while some guests enjoyed his presence, others were a bit put off by his loudness and tendency to dominate conversations. At one point, he even interrupted Sarah while she was trying to play a song, talking loudly about a completely unrelated topic, which caused some awkwardness. 

After a while, I noticed that Sarah seemed uncomfortable and distracted, so I gently approached her and asked if she wanted to take a break from performing. I thought it might be a good idea to give her a chance to enjoy the party without feeling pressured to entertain. She agreed, and we both went outside for a breath of fresh air.

Later that night, Sarah thanked me for stepping in, saying she appreciated the support. However, Mike confronted me, claiming that I was trying to sabotage Sarah’s performance and that he thought it was rude to interrupt her. I explained that I was only looking out for her well-being and that I didn't mean to step on anyone’s toes. He seemed to calm down after our conversation, but I felt a little awkward for the rest of the evening.

Now, I’m wondering if I handled the situation poorly. I genuinely wanted to support my friend, but I also didn’t want to come off as an asshole to Mike. So, am I the asshole for stepping in and distracting Sarah from her performance?",648,1628,0.89,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_82519,2024-09-14 00:00:00,NAH,2263,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"This happened a few months ago, but it’s come up again recently, so I figured I’d share and see what you all think.

My friend Lisa (27) is one of the most caring and thoughtful people I know. She always goes out of her way to help others, and her positivity is infectious. However, she has a bit of a messy side—her apartment often ends up being cluttered, and sometimes it can get overwhelming. She had recently gone through a tough breakup and was really struggling to keep her space tidy.

One weekend, I offered to come over and hang out. When I arrived, I was taken aback by how chaotic things were. Clothes were strewn everywhere, there were dishes piled up, and it felt a bit suffocating. I could tell she was feeling embarrassed, but she insisted we just relax and watch some movies.

After a while, I could see she was distracted and stressed by the mess. I knew she was overwhelmed and needed help, so I casually suggested we tidy up a bit together while we watched. She hesitated but eventually agreed. We started working on the living room, and as we cleaned, it felt like a weight was lifting off her shoulders. We put on some music and made it fun, turning it into a little dance party while we picked up.

By the time we were done, the place looked so much better, and Lisa was genuinely grateful. She laughed and said she didn’t know how much she needed that. However, I could tell she was also a little embarrassed about how it had gotten so out of hand. 

A few weeks later, while hanging out again, Lisa mentioned how she felt bad about the mess and how it made her feel inadequate. I reassured her that everyone goes through rough patches and that I was there for her no matter what. I was just happy to help a friend in need.

I later heard from another friend that Lisa had mentioned my cleaning as kind of condescending. I honestly didn’t mean for it to come off that way; I just wanted to help her feel more comfortable in her own space.

So, am I the asshole for helping Lisa clean without her asking? I genuinely just wanted to support her, but I’m starting to wonder if I overstepped.",247,2981,0.71,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_18595,2018-02-25 00:00:00,NAH,2112,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"This is a throwaway account for reasons that will become clear. I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could use some outside perspective.

So, to give you some context, I (24F) moved into a new apartment with my friend Sarah (25F) about six months ago. We’ve known each other for years and thought it would be a great idea to live together. Everything was going smoothly until last month when Sarah's mother was diagnosed with a serious illness. It’s been a really tough time for her and her family, and understandably, Sarah has been feeling overwhelmed with stress and worry.

After a particularly difficult week, Sarah asked me if it would be okay for her younger brother, Ethan (17M), to stay with us for a while. He’s been having a hard time dealing with everything too, and she thought it would help to have him close by. I completely understood where she was coming from and agreed to it, wanting to support her and her family during this tough time.

Initially, things were fine. Ethan is a good kid and kept to himself a lot. However, as the weeks went by, he started spending most of his time in the living room playing video games loudly and eating all the snacks in the pantry. I tried to be patient since I knew he was going through a lot, but it started to become disruptive, especially when I was trying to study or have friends over.

Last week, I was studying for an important exam when Ethan had friends over for a gaming session. They were really loud, and I could barely concentrate. I went into the living room to ask them to keep it down, and while Ethan was respectful, I could see his friends were less than pleased. I felt bad for interrupting their fun, but I also felt frustrated because I hadn’t signed up for a full house.

After talking it over with Sarah, I suggested to her that Ethan might benefit from having some space of his own, like staying with their dad for a bit, especially since it seemed like he needed a bit of a break from the situation at home as well. Sarah got upset and said I was being insensitive to Ethan’s needs and that he was already dealing with so much. I didn’t mean to come off that way, and I tried to explain that I was just looking for a balance.

Sarah and I ended up having a heated conversation about it, and I left feeling like I might have overstepped. I just wanted to create a comfortable living environment for both of us, but now I’m wondering if I was wrong to bring it up at all. 

So, AITA for suggesting that Ethan stay somewhere else for a while to give everyone some space?",681,2456,0.83,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_60204,2022-03-04 00:00:00,NAH,2543,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"A little backstory here: 

I (28F) have a good friend, Sam (30M), who has been struggling with anxiety and depression for a while now. We've been friends since college, and I always try to support him as best as I can. Recently, he started going to therapy, which I think is a great step for him. However, he often relies on me for emotional support and tends to call or text me late at night when he's feeling down, which has been quite frequent lately.

Last week, I had a particularly exhausting week at work and was really looking forward to a quiet evening at home. Just as I was settling in, I got a call from Sam around 10 PM. He sounded extremely upset and wanted to talk. I tried to be there for him, but I was also feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. I gently told him that I was really tired and needed to rest, but that I was here for him in the morning if he wanted to talk then. 

Sam became upset and accused me of not being a good friend and not caring about him. I felt terrible because I do care about him deeply, but I also realized that I needed to prioritize my own mental health and rest. I ended the call and sent him a text message saying that I truly wanted to help but needed to take care of myself as well. 

The next day, he seemed to have calmed down and we talked about it. He apologized for getting upset and understood where I was coming from. We both agreed that it's important to support each other while also respecting boundaries.

No one is the Asshole,"First time posting, and I'm hoping to get some perspective because I feel conflicted about a recent family gathering.

A little background:

My partner and I have been together for two years, and they come from a very close-knit family who love to host big gatherings. They’re always laughing, chatting, and just loving life together. My family, on the other hand, is much smaller and more reserved. We typically keep our gatherings low-key and don’t often have large family events. 

Recently, my partner’s family hosted a big birthday party for one of their relatives, and I was invited along. I was excited but also a bit anxious because I knew it would be a packed house with a lot of unfamiliar faces. When I arrived, I was immediately swept into the warm chaos of hugs and kisses from everyone, which threw me off. I'm not used to that kind of physical affection from people I don’t know well, so I felt a bit overwhelmed.

Throughout the evening, I tried to engage in conversations, but I struggled to keep up with the rapid-fire talking and joking in a language that wasn’t my first. My partner did their best to include me, translating and keeping me in the loop, but I still felt like an outsider. At one point, I was sitting on the couch, feeling lost amidst the laughter and loud conversations, and my partner’s cousin came over to ask me why I seemed so quiet. I responded, maybe a bit too bluntly, that I was just feeling overwhelmed and wished people would slow down and maybe even speak a little more English so I could join in.

This led to a bit of an awkward moment, as I could see their cousin was surprised and didn’t mean any harm. They said something like, “We’re just having fun! You should relax and join us!” I ended up apologizing for coming off rude, but I still felt bad that I made things awkward.

My partner noticed my discomfort and suggested we take a break outside for some fresh air. We stepped outside, and I expressed how I felt out of place but didn’t want to ruin the fun for them or their family. They reassured me that it was okay to feel that way and that they appreciated my honesty.

Ultimately, we stayed for a couple more hours, but I still felt like I didn’t quite fit in. I’ve talked to my partner about how I might feel about future gatherings, and they’ve been really supportive, saying they want me to be comfortable.

So, I’m wondering, AITA for expressing my discomfort at their family gathering, or was it just a misunderstanding?",639,1291,0.83,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_21686,2023-11-27 00:00:00,NAH,2485,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"First some background. I’m a single dad of a 7-year-old son, and we have a pretty close-knit family. My parents, especially my dad, are very hands-on with my son and love spending time with him. However, there's a bit of a problem: my dad has a habit of giving my son a lot of candy whenever they hang out.

I know that some treats here and there are fine, but my dad goes a bit overboard. During their visits, my son can come home with bags of candy, and I’m worried about his dental health and overall diet. I’ve talked to my dad about it before, suggesting that maybe they could do some fun activities together instead of just focusing on candy, but he brushes it off, saying he just wants to spoil his grandson a little.

Recently, it came to a head when I found my son had hidden a stash of candy under his bed. When I asked him about it, he said he was saving it for later because he didn't want to tell Grandpa he couldn’t have it. I sat him down and explained that while treats are okay, moderation is important, and hiding candy isn’t the best solution.

I decided to have a conversation with my dad. I told him that as much as I appreciate his generosity, I needed him to limit the candy and find other ways to bond with my son. My dad was offended and said I was being too strict and that “kids should enjoy their childhood.” We ended the conversation a bit on edge, and now there’s tension between us.

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have a shared interest in gardening, and this year we decided to try our hands at growing some vegetables. We both agreed on the types of veggies we wanted to plant, and we spent a lot of time preparing the garden bed together. 

A few weeks into the growing season, I noticed that one of the tomato plants started to look sickly. I did some research and found out that it might be affected by a common tomato disease. I wanted to remove the affected plant to prevent the disease from spreading to the healthy ones, but my partner insisted that we should try to nurse it back to health instead. They believed that with a little extra care, we could save it.

After some discussion, we decided on a compromise: I would try to support the sick plant for a week, and if it didn’t show improvement, we would pull it out. Unfortunately, the plant did not recover. When I finally pulled it out, my partner was upset. They felt it was a loss since we had put in so much effort together. I tried to explain that it was for the best and that we needed to protect the other plants, but they were still disappointed.

In the end, we both agreed that this was a learning experience and that we should communicate better about our gardening decisions. We decided to focus on caring for the remaining plants and not let this setback ruin our gardening season. I feel bad for how it turned out, but I think we handled it well. AITA?

She was really excited about the opportunity but has been feeling overwhelmed with the workload. I’ve noticed that she’s been pretty stressed lately, and our usual hangout sessions have become less frequent.

Last week, I decided to plan a surprise dinner for her to help her unwind and remind her that she’s not alone in this. I spent a lot of time cooking her favorite meal and invited a few mutual friends to join. I thought it would be a nice way for her to relax and catch up with everyone.

However, when I texted her the day before to confirm the plans, she replied that she really needed some alone time that evening to prepare for an important project deadline. I felt bad because I had put in a lot of effort, but I also understood where she was coming from. I suggested that we could reschedule for another time, but I could tell she felt guilty for declining.

In the end, I chose to go ahead with the dinner anyway with the friends who could make it, and I sent Sarah a message letting her know we missed her and that we’d plan something again soon. She appreciated the thought and told me she would love to see us when she had more time to relax.

I hope I didn’t come off as inconsiderate for going through with the dinner without her, but I really wanted to support her during a tough time.

Last week, it was my turn to put our child to bed. We had a busy day, and by the time we got home, it was already past 7:30 PM. My partner usually has a strict rule of no screens after 7 PM, but I decided to let our child finish the episode of a show they were watching because I thought it would help them relax before bed. I figured it was okay since it was a Friday night, and we didn’t have to worry about getting up early the next day.

When my partner came home later in the evening, they were upset to see our child still watching TV. I explained my reasoning, saying it was a special occasion and I had planned to limit screen time for the rest of the weekend. My partner felt that I undermined their authority and that we should have discussed it beforehand. I understood where they were coming from, but I thought I made a reasonable decision given the circumstances.

The next day, we talked it over, and I apologized for not discussing it with them first. They also acknowledged that they could have been more flexible about the screen time rule for that one night. We both recognized that we need to communicate better about our parenting decisions and be on the same page.

No one is the Asshole,"Some background: I was at a local park with my dog last weekend around noon. It was a sunny day, and I was enjoying some time outdoors when I noticed a family having a picnic nearby. They had a few kids running around, and one of the kids, a little girl probably around five years old, came over to my dog, who was on a leash and sitting calmly next to me.

The girl was excited and wanted to pet my dog, and I could see her parents watching from a distance, smiling. I had no problem with her approaching, so I told her it was okay and encouraged her to gently pet my dog. She was super happy and started to interact with him.

A few minutes later, as I was chatting with the girl, I noticed that she was pulling at my dog’s ears a bit too roughly. I gently reminded her to be soft and kind, as my dog was getting a little uncomfortable. The girl didn’t seem to understand and continued to tug a bit, which made my dog let out a small whine.

At that point, I decided it was best to intervene a bit more directly. I told her, “I think it’s time for us to go now,” and gently guided my dog away while thanking her for petting him. I could see that she looked a bit disappointed, but I thought it was necessary for my dog's comfort.

The parents approached me shortly after, and while they were polite, I could tell they were a bit annoyed. They said that the girl was just excited and meant no harm. I apologized and explained that I just wanted to make sure my dog felt safe. They seemed to understand but still looked a little frustrated.

After this, I felt conflicted. I didn’t want to come off as rude or dismissive of the girl’s excitement, but I also wanted to ensure my dog was comfortable. I can’t stop thinking if I was too harsh in separating them or if I could have handled it differently. Was I being overly protective, or was I justified in my actions?

She’s adorable and full of energy, but it quickly became clear that she requires a lot of attention and training, more than we initially anticipated. My partner works full-time, while I have a part-time job and some flexible hours, which I thought would give me enough time to help train and care for her.

I didn’t mean to come off as negative—I was just trying to be realistic about our resources and time. After the meeting, one of the volunteers approached me and shared that they felt I had killed the vibe, while another thanked me for keeping us grounded.

Now, I feel torn. I wanted to contribute constructively, but I also don’t want to be seen as the person who always brings the mood down. I’ve been thinking about how to balance being honest with my opinions while also being supportive of others' ideas.

No one is the Asshole,"So my friend Jake and I decided to have a movie night at my place. He’s a huge fan of horror films, while I usually prefer comedies. However, I agreed to watch a couple of his favorite horror movies since I wanted to spend time with him.

As we settled down on the couch with popcorn and snacks, Jake suggested we watch this particularly intense horror flick that I had heard was really scary. I was a bit hesitant but didn’t want to seem like a wimp, so I went along with it.

About halfway through the movie, I was so on edge that I started cracking jokes to lighten the mood. I made comments about the absurdity of certain scenes and poked fun at the characters. Jake, on the other hand, was completely immersed in the film and was getting annoyed with my humor.

After a particularly scary scene, I made a joking comment about how the killer must really be bad at hide-and-seek, and Jake snapped at me to stop talking. I could tell he was really into the movie and my comments were breaking his immersion, so I apologized and tried to watch more seriously.

Once the movie ended, Jake said he had a good time but felt like I didn’t take the film seriously, which made him a bit frustrated. I explained that I was just trying to cope with the fear and make it a fun experience for both of us.

We ended up having a good discussion about different movie preferences and agreed to alternate movie nights in the future.

No one is the Asshole,"Last spring, my 15-year-old daughter started hanging out with a girl from school who seemed nice at first. They quickly became inseparable, and I was happy to see my daughter making new friends. However, I soon noticed that this new friend had some issues at home. She often talked about her parents fighting and how they were rarely around. I felt a bit of sympathy, but I also noticed that my daughter was picking up on some not-so-great behaviors, like skipping homework and being disrespectful to authority figures.

As time went on, the friend started coming over almost every day after school. I welcomed her because I wanted to create a safe space for my daughter's friend, but it began to feel overwhelming. I have two younger children, and I found it increasingly difficult to manage the dynamics in the house. The friend would often bring her personal dramas with her, and I felt responsible for providing emotional support, which was exhausting. 

One day, after a particularly chaotic weekend where the friend had a meltdown over her home life, I decided I needed to set boundaries. I sat down with my daughter and explained that while I appreciated her friendship with this girl, it was starting to negatively affect her schoolwork and behavior at home. I told her that I would prefer if her friend didn't come over during the week and that she could see her only on weekends, allowing some time for both of them to focus on their own responsibilities.

My daughter was upset but understood where I was coming from. I approached the friend, gently explaining that it would be best if she didn’t come over as often, and she expressed her gratitude for my support but agreed it was probably for the best. It was a tough conversation, but I felt relieved to have set those boundaries.

In the end, I think we all learned from the experience. My daughter continued to support her friend, but in a way that was healthier for her. I didn't want to shut the friend out completely; I just wanted to ensure we maintained a balance in our household. It felt like a necessary step, and I hope it was taken with understanding by everyone involved.",994,1787,0.94,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_79396,2020-03-31 00:00:00,NAH,2148,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"A few months ago, my partner and I decided to host a game night at our place to catch up with some friends. We invited four close friends: A, C, D, and E. We planned to order pizza, have snacks, and play some board games. In our group, we usually rotate who hosts these nights, and everyone typically brings something to share or chip in for food.

As the night approached, I started to feel a bit overwhelmed with preparations. I’m not the best at organizing events, and I wanted everything to be perfect. I reached out to our friends in the group chat and asked if everyone could bring a snack or drink to contribute. Everyone agreed. E said she would bring her famous brownies, C offered some chips, and D said he’d pick up some soda. A, however, just said he’d be there.

The night of the game night came, and I was a bit anxious. I made sure to have pizza ordered and snacks ready. When A arrived, he came empty-handed, which surprised me. I was expecting him to bring something, like he usually does. I didn’t want to make a big deal about it at first, but I felt a bit put out since I had asked everyone to contribute.

As the night went on, I noticed that A seemed a bit disengaged, spending more time on his phone than joining in the games. During a break, I casually mentioned how great everyone’s snacks were and playfully pointed out that A hadn’t brought anything. I didn’t mean to call him out, but I was hoping to lighten the mood and get him to engage more. Instead, he looked a bit embarrassed and said he had had a rough week and just forgot.

I immediately felt guilty for bringing it up, noticing how I had unintentionally put him on the spot. The atmosphere got a little tense, but we moved on, and A eventually joined in for the games. By the end of the night, everyone had a good time, and we all laughed and shared stories. However, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had made A uncomfortable.

I later talked to my partner about it, and they suggested that A might have been stressed and I unintentionally added to that. I want to check in with A to see how he’s feeling, but I’m worried that I might seem like the asshole for bringing it up.

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been together for several years now, and we recently started discussing marriage. One topic that came up was the idea of having children in the future. I grew up in a family that valued open communication and sharing responsibilities, so I assumed my partner felt the same.

During one of our conversations, I suggested that we should both be involved in parenting equally, regardless of who takes on the primary caregiving role. I mentioned that I wanted us to make decisions together, from choosing schools to discussing discipline strategies. My partner, however, seemed to take this as an implication that I doubted their ability to be a good parent. They expressed that they felt I was undermining their confidence and making them feel like I didn’t trust their instincts.

I didn’t mean to convey that at all; I just wanted us to be on the same page and work as a team. After some back and forth, it became clear that we both had different views on parenting roles, and it started to spark heated discussions. We both ended up feeling hurt, and I realized that I might have been too focused on my perspective without fully considering my partner’s feelings.

In the end, we agreed to have a sit-down discussion with a counselor to help us navigate our differences.

When we got there, I noticed that one of our mutual friends, Sarah, seemed upset. Throughout the evening, she was quiet and didn’t engage much with the group.

Around the end of the night, I asked her if she was okay. She mentioned that she was feeling left out because she had just gone through a tough time in her life and wasn't ready to socialize as much. I felt bad for not picking up on her mood earlier and suggested that we step outside for some fresh air and talk privately.

She replied that she appreciated my concern but acknowledged that she just needed time to process things on her own. We both agreed that it was a tough situation and that communication could have been better on both sides.

No one is the Asshole,"This is my first time posting here, so I hope I’m doing this right!

I (30F) have been living in a small apartment in the city for the past three years. I love my space, but it’s starting to feel cramped, especially since I work from home full-time. Over the last year, I've been considering upgrading to a bigger place, preferably with a little outdoor space. I’ve saved up a decent amount, but I need a co-signer for a mortgage since my income isn’t quite enough on its own.

My parents (Dad, 60 and Mom, 58) have always been supportive of my goals, so I approached them about co-signing for a new apartment. They agreed but made sure to emphasize that they would only help if I could guarantee my ability to make the payments. They want to avoid any financial risk, which I completely understand. 

After a few months of searching, I found a lovely two-bedroom apartment with a small yard. I was so excited! I called my parents to share the news and to ask for their support again as I was ready to make an offer. During that call, I also mentioned that I had been considering fostering a dog once I moved into the new place. I’ve always loved animals and have experience caring for dogs, and I thought fostering would be a great way to give back while also making my home a happier place.

To my surprise, both of my parents reacted negatively. They felt that fostering a dog would be irresponsible and might jeopardize my ability to keep up with mortgage payments. They expressed concerns about potential damages to the property and the time commitment involved. They even hinted that they might reconsider co-signing if I went ahead with the plan.

I tried to explain that fostering wouldn’t be a permanent commitment and that I had a plan in place to cover any potential issues. I also emphasized that fostering would help me with my mental health, especially during these stressful times. However, they were still upset, and the conversation turned quite tense.

In the end, I decided not to mention the fostering idea again until after my offer on the apartment was accepted, hoping it would ease their worries. I made the offer, which got accepted, and I feel relieved and excited. 

I’m now in a dilemma about whether or not to tell my parents about the fostering plan. I don’t want to jeopardize the co-signing agreement, but I also believe in being honest with them. 

So, Reddit, AITA for wanting to foster a dog while buying a new apartment? I genuinely think this is a good decision for my well-being, but I also understand their concerns regarding financial responsibility. Would love your thoughts! 

Edit to clarify: I want to know if I’m in the wrong for wanting to foster a dog as I move into a new place, especially given my parents' concerns about financial implications. I know they have my best interests at heart, but I feel strongly about this decision for my mental health.",528,1525,0.66,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_23814,2019-02-25 00:00:00,NAH,2901,AITA

So here’s my situation: I’ve been volunteering at a local animal shelter for a couple of years now, and I genuinely love it. The shelter has been struggling financially, and I’ve been trying to help out as much as I can. Recently, they held a fundraising event where they sold various items, and part of my responsibility was to help organize it.

While I was planning the event, I also decided to create some handmade pet toys to donate and sell at the event. I spent a lot of time making these toys, and I felt good about contributing something tangible. However, I didn’t realize that some of my friends who were also volunteering felt like I was taking away potential sales from the shelter by making these toys to sell. They believed that if I was going to donate items, I should just give them directly to the shelter instead of selling them. 

I was taken aback when they confronted me about it. They said it was unfair and that it could potentially hurt the shelter’s fundraising efforts in the long run. I explained that my intention was to help, and I thought the toys would attract more people and potentially raise more money. They acknowledged that my heart was in the right place but insisted that my actions could be seen as undermining the shelter’s needs.

I’m feeling a bit guilty now. I don’t want to be seen as someone who overstepped, but I also believe in what I did. I love animals and want to do everything I can to support the shelter. I really don’t think anyone is an asshole here; we all just want to help in our own ways.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I recently had a disagreement with my sister about our family’s annual holiday gathering. Every year, we host this big get-together at our parents' house, and everyone contributes a dish or drink. I usually take care of the main course, which is great because I love cooking for the family.

This year, my sister decided she wanted to host the dinner at her place instead. She has a smaller apartment, but she was really excited about it. I thought it was a sweet idea, but I also pointed out that it might be a bit cramped, especially since our whole extended family would be coming. She brushed it off and insisted it would be fine.

As the planning progressed, my sister asked everyone to bring a dish, but she also mentioned that she didn’t want any of us to bring the main course, which I usually handle. I was a little hurt since I love cooking for everyone and felt like she was taking that away from me. I didn't say anything at first, but I kept feeling uneasy.

Eventually, I brought it up with her. I told her that I appreciated her wanting to host, but I felt a bit sidelined since I always enjoy preparing the main dish for the family. She got defensive and said that it was her turn to do things her way and that I shouldn’t take it so personally.

I realized that I was coming off as controlling and not being supportive of her efforts, but I also felt like I was losing something I love doing. After some back-and-forth, we reached a compromise where she would host, but I could still prepare a smaller main dish to share.

In the end, the gathering went really well, and everyone had a great time, but I still feel a little conflicted about how I handled it. I was just trying to express my feelings, but I wonder if I was being unreasonable.

I often invite him out to grab dinner or just hang out, and while he appreciates the gestures, he always seems to bring up how tight his finances are, which makes it awkward.

A few weeks ago, Mark called me in tears, saying he was overwhelmed and didn’t know what to do. I offered to meet up to talk it through, which he accepted. During our meet-up, he opened up about his struggles, and I felt compelled to help him out. I ended up offering to pay for our dinner, but I also mentioned that I couldn’t keep doing that every time we went out. I suggested we could do activities that are free or low-cost, like hiking or movie nights at home. 

Mark seemed a bit offended and said he felt embarrassed asking for help, but I reassured him that he didn’t need to feel that way. I just wanted to support him without putting myself in a difficult position financially. He ended up saying he appreciated the offer but that it was hard for him to adjust to the idea of not going out to eat as much.

After that conversation, he started declining my invites, saying he didn’t want me to feel obligated to pay for him.

We’ve always supported each other through ups and downs, and last year, we both went through significant breakups. After a few months, we started spending more time together, often going out for drinks or just hanging out at each other’s places.

One evening, while we were watching movies, I noticed Sarah seemed a bit down. I asked her if something was bothering her, and after some hesitation, she admitted she felt lonely and was struggling with her self-esteem since her breakup. She told me she missed the intimacy and connection she used to have. I listened and tried to comfort her, but I also made a comment about how I think she’s beautiful and amazing, and that it’s important for her to feel good about herself.

No one is the Asshole,"Last weekend, my partner and I decided to spend some time hiking in a local nature reserve. We love being outdoors and it seemed like the perfect way to unwind. We packed a picnic and took our dog along, as he loves exploring new places.

During our hike, we came across a beautiful area with a small stream and some wildflowers. It was a great spot to stop for our picnic. While we were eating, I noticed my dog getting a bit restless, so I thought it would be a good idea to let him off his leash for a while, as the area was relatively secluded, and I could keep an eye on him.

Unfortunately, as soon as he was off the leash, he spotted some small creatures in the bushes and took off after them. I immediately called him back, but he was too excited and didn’t listen. My partner and I ran after him, calling his name. After a few minutes of searching, we found him in the bushes, proudly holding a baby bird in his mouth. I panicked and managed to get the bird away from him just in time, but it was shaken up and injured.

Feeling guilty and upset, I couldn’t help but blame myself for letting him off the leash. My partner was understandably upset too, but she tried to comfort me, saying accidents happen. We spent the next hour tending to the bird, wrapping it up in a cloth and trying to keep it calm. We called a local wildlife rescue, who advised us to bring the bird in for treatment.

On the way back, I was pretty quiet, feeling the weight of what had happened. My partner noticed and asked if I was okay. I admitted I felt guilty for letting our dog off the leash, especially since I knew he had a strong prey drive. She then pointed out that it could have happened to anyone and that it wasn’t just my fault. I appreciated her trying to comfort me, but I still felt responsible.

No one is the Asshole,"Hello everyone,

I’d like to share an experience I had recently that’s been on my mind. A few weeks ago, my friends and I went on a weekend camping trip to a popular national park. There were four of us, and we had reserved a campsite that could accommodate our group comfortably. 

When we arrived, we set up our tents and started enjoying the great outdoors. As the sun began to set, we noticed a family of five who had just arrived at the nearby campsite. It was clear they were struggling to set up their tents and were a bit overwhelmed. They had reserved a site, but it was much smaller than they anticipated, and they were running out of daylight.

After a few minutes of watching them, we decided to offer our help. We approached them and asked if they needed assistance. They gratefully accepted, and we helped them with their tents and even shared some of our firewood since they didn’t have enough to keep warm for the night.

As we were chatting, they mentioned that they had driven over five hours to get there, and it was their first family camping trip. They were really excited but stressed about getting everything set up. We spent a couple of hours helping them and ended up having a lovely evening together around the campfire, sharing stories and roasting marshmallows.

The next morning, we offered to share our breakfast with them as well. They insisted on reciprocating and offered us some of their homemade snacks. It turned into a great bonding experience, and we exchanged contact information to stay in touch.

Looking back, I wonder if we should have just kept to ourselves and not intervened. My friends and I felt good about helping them, but I’m concerned that maybe we overstepped by getting involved in their situation.

So, I have this friend, Alex, who recently started dating someone new, Jamie. They were really excited about their relationship, and I wanted to support them. One day, while hanging out with a few mutual friends, Alex mentioned something about Jamie being ""too clingy."" I jokingly said, “Well, if they’re that clingy, maybe you should rethink the relationship?” 

At first, everyone laughed, but then I noticed Alex’s expression change. They looked really hurt and defensive. I honestly thought I was being funny and not crossing any lines, but Alex took it seriously and said, “That’s not cool, man.” 

I immediately tried to backtrack, saying I was just joking and I actually thought they were great together. But the damage was done. The mood shifted, and Alex left the hangout early, which made me feel awful. I reached out to them later that night to apologize, explaining I didn't mean to offend and that I was just trying to lighten the mood. 

Alex responded, saying they appreciated my message but still felt uncomfortable about the comment. After a few more messages, we agreed to meet up to talk it through. When we met, we both shared our perspectives, and I realized that I was dismissing their feelings with my joke. Alex admitted that they were feeling a bit overwhelmed in the relationship and my comment just hit at the wrong moment.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I’d like some feedback on a situation that happened recently involving my 7-year-old daughter. She’s been really into dinosaurs lately, and she decided she wanted to dress up as a Velociraptor for her school’s Halloween costume day. She was super excited about it and had all these ideas for the costume.

Initially, she wanted to go all out with a full dinosaur suit, but we found that most of those costumes were either way too big or really expensive for a one-time wear. So, we decided to get creative and put together a costume ourselves. We ended up making a dinosaur tail from fabric and stuffing, and we found some cool green and brown clothes that we could use as a base.

When it came to the headpiece, she really wanted to have a ferocious dinosaur look, so we created a headband with some felt spikes and a few painted cardboard pieces to look like a dinosaur head. It looked pretty good, but it was definitely homemade and not perfect.

The issue arose when we were discussing face paint. She was insistent on painting her face green to match the dinosaur theme. I thought about it but was worried about how it might come across since she’s a white child and the green face paint might be misinterpreted, especially in a school setting.

I explained to her that while I understood her desire to look like a dinosaur, we might want to skip the face paint to avoid any misunderstandings with her teachers or classmates. I suggested we could use a little green eyeshadow instead, just for fun, but she was really disappointed and felt like it wasn’t the same.

In the end, we settled on just the costume without the face paint, and she wore some dinosaur-themed accessories instead. She was still happy with it, but I could tell she was a bit let down. 

I feel like I made the right call to avoid any potential issues, but I also don’t want to stifle her creativity or make her feel bad about wanting to express herself. Am I an asshole for not letting her paint her face green, or was it a reasonable decision? I’d appreciate your thoughts and advice on how to handle situations like this in the future.",855,656,0.69,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_40278,2024-05-22 00:00:00,NAH,2119,AITA

Recently, she shared that she feels overwhelmed in large social situations and has been trying to avoid them as much as possible. I completely understand where she’s coming from and have always tried to be supportive.

Last weekend, there was a big gathering at our mutual friend Mike's house, and I knew Sarah was hesitant to attend because of her anxiety. I reached out to her and told her I would be there and that I’d love for her to come along. I reassured her that we could leave whenever she wanted and that I would stick by her side. After some back and forth, she decided to join me, and I was really happy.

When we arrived, Sarah immediately started to look uneasy. There were a lot of people, loud music, and she quickly felt overwhelmed. I realized that maybe I should have respected her initial instinct to stay home. I tried to engage her in conversations and help her feel more comfortable, but I could see it was not working.

After about half an hour, she told me she wanted to leave. I was a bit disappointed but completely understood, so we left together. On our way home, she expressed frustration, saying she felt pressured to go because I insisted. I apologized and explained that I thought she might feel better once she was there, but I didn’t mean to put any pressure on her.

No one is the Asshole,"A couple of years ago, I had a friend, L, who was going through a tough time. They had recently lost their job and were feeling down about everything. I wanted to help in any way I could, so I invited L to spend time with me and my family on weekends to keep their spirits up.

During one of those weekends, we were out in my backyard, and I noticed that L was particularly interested in my garden. I had put a lot of effort into it, growing vegetables and flowers, and I was proud of the results. I offered L some vegetables to take home since I had more than I could use. L seemed grateful but then asked if they could take some of the flowers too, as they wanted to brighten up their apartment.

I hesitated because I had put a lot of work into those flowers, and I wasn't sure if I was ready to part with them, but I thought about how much L needed some positivity in their life and agreed. L took a few flowers, and I felt good for helping a friend in need.

However, a couple of weeks later, I visited L's apartment and noticed that the flowers I had given them were not well cared for. Some were wilted, and others had died. I felt a pang of disappointment seeing my hard work not appreciated. I mentioned it lightly to L, saying I noticed some of the flowers weren't doing well.

L seemed defensive and said that they were trying their best, but it was hard to keep up with everything. I realized then that L's struggles were deeper than I had understood, and I felt bad for bringing it up. I apologized for my comment and reassured L that I was just glad they had some flowers, even if they weren't thriving.

Looking back, I think we both acted in a way that was understandable given our situations. I wanted to help, and L was doing their best to cope. I wonder if I should have just kept my feelings to myself. Was I the asshole for saying anything about the flowers?",920,1605,0.78,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_82090,2023-12-16 00:00:00,NAH,1879,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, my daughter (14) has been struggling with anxiety for a while now. She used to love participating in her dance classes, but after the pandemic hit, she became increasingly withdrawn and stopped attending. She would get overwhelmed just thinking about going back to the studio, even though she genuinely misses dancing.

As parents, my wife and I have been supportive and patient, encouraging her to talk about her feelings and find ways to cope, but she was resistant to any suggestions about attending classes again. We had a family vacation planned where we were going to visit a theme park that has a dance-themed show that she loved as a kid. I thought it might reignite her passion for dance if she saw it again.

A few days before the trip, I brought up the idea of attending the show, but she panicked and said she didn’t want to go to the park at all. I could see how much it was affecting her, so I gently insisted that we should at least try to go, as it was a family trip and we'd all enjoy it together. I assured her that if it got too overwhelming, we could leave anytime.

When we got to the park, she was visibly anxious, and after a couple of hours of being there, I noticed she was really struggling. I felt bad for pushing her to come, and I made the decision to take her back to the hotel so she could relax. It turned out to be a great choice for her, as she was able to unwind and we spent the evening watching movies together.

After the trip, I reflected on it and hoped I hadn’t pushed too hard. I think I just wanted her to reconnect with something she loved.

At our last meeting, I noticed that one of the members, Sarah, seemed a bit quiet and reserved. I approached her afterward to chat, hoping to make her feel more included. We ended up having a great conversation about our favorite books, and I thought we hit it off. Feeling encouraged, I invited her to join me for coffee the following weekend, thinking it would be a nice way to get to know each other better.

I completely understood and told her that it was no problem at all, and we could definitely reschedule when she felt up to it.

After that, I learned through another member of the book club that Sarah had actually been dealing with some personal issues and wasn’t ready to socialize much. I felt really bad for putting her on the spot and unintentionally making her feel pressured.

No one is the Asshole,"I’ve always considered myself to be a pretty easy-going person, but there was an incident recently that left me questioning whether I handled things the right way. 

My daughter, A, is 8 years old and is very passionate about art. She loves painting and has a bright imagination. A few weeks ago, she was invited to a birthday party for one of her classmates, and I was excited to see her have fun. The party was at a local art studio, which had a fun painting activity planned for the kids.

At the party, the instructor decided to let the kids paint whatever they wanted, which I thought was fantastic. However, as the party went on, I noticed that A was becoming increasingly frustrated. She was trying to paint a picture of a unicorn but was struggling with the colors and getting it just right. I could see she was on the verge of tears, feeling like her painting wasn't good enough compared to the other kids.

I approached her and asked if she wanted some help. She initially declined, wanting to figure it out on her own, but I could tell she was really upset. So, in a moment of wanting to encourage her, I suggested that we could work together on her painting. I thought it might lift her spirits.

When I stepped in to help, I ended up doing a lot of the painting myself, adding details and bright colors while A watched. In hindsight, I realized that I may have taken over her project entirely, and while she was smiling and excited about how it turned out, I could see the glances from other parents. Some looked at me like I was overstepping, and I started to feel self-conscious.

After the party, A told me she had a lot of fun, but she also mentioned she felt like I did too much of the work for her. I didn’t mean to overshadow her creativity, and I genuinely wanted to support her. I thought I was helping her express herself better, but now I wonder if I was too pushy in wanting her to create something impressive.

No one is the Asshole,"Throwaway because I need some perspective on this situation.

So, I (28F) have a younger brother, ""Jake"" (24M), who has always been a bit of a free spirit. He has a passion for music and decided to pursue it full-time, which was great, but it also meant he had a pretty unstable lifestyle. He doesn't have a steady job, and he often asks family for financial help to cover his bills or fund his music projects. 

I've always supported him emotionally and encouraged him to follow his dreams, but I also feel that he's been taking advantage of the support we offer. My parents are the type who believe in unconditional support, no matter what, while I lean more towards tough love. I think it's important for him to learn responsibility and understand the value of money. 

Recently, Jake reached out to me again, asking for money to cover a rent payment because he had a gig that didn’t pay enough to cover his bills. I felt torn; on one hand, I didn't want to see him struggle, but on the other hand, I didn't want to enable his reckless financial choices. So, I told him I couldn't lend him money this time because I felt it would just prolong his cycle of dependency. Instead, I offered to help him brainstorm ways to improve his finances or look for part-time work that could give him more stability.

Jake was really upset and called me selfish, saying that I was the only sibling not supporting him. He said that my refusal to help him out financially felt like I didn’t believe in him or his music. I tried to explain my perspective, but it just turned into an argument. He hung up on me, and I felt terrible.

After a few days, I reached out again to apologize for how the conversation escalated, but I reiterated my stance about not lending him money. He appreciated my apology but still felt hurt and said he wasn’t sure if he could trust me to support him if things got tough in the future.

I feel conflicted. I want him to succeed, but I also want him to be responsible. I think my approach was reasonable given the circumstances, but I can see how he might feel abandoned.

No one is the Asshole,"This happened a few months ago, and I’ve been mulling it over ever since. I was at a friend's birthday party, which was a bit of a reunion for our old high school group. There was a lot of excitement to see everyone again, and we all had a great time catching up.

During the party, one of my old classmates, Sarah, who I hadn’t seen in years, was discussing her recent engagement. She was really enthusiastic about it and shared how her fiancé proposed during a trip to Italy. It was this romantic story that had everyone oohing and aahing, and I was genuinely happy for her.

As the conversations flowed, Sarah decided to show off a few pictures from the engagement trip. In one of the photos, she was with her fiancé on a beautiful beach, and everyone was complimenting how stunning they looked. In the moment, I jokingly blurted out, ""Wow, you’re practically glowing! Are you sure that’s not just the Instagram filter?""

I meant it in a light-hearted way, but it didn’t land well. Sarah’s face fell, and she seemed taken aback. I could tell I’d hurt her feelings, and I immediately felt awful. This wasn’t about me wanting to belittle her; I just didn’t think through how my comment might sound. I quickly apologized and told her that I was just joking and that she looked fantastic, filter or not.

After that, the mood shifted a bit, but Sarah was gracious and smiled, saying it was okay. Throughout the evening, I kept thinking about how I might have overshadowed her moment. The other friends around us were supportive, and no one seemed to hold it against me, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I might have been insensitive.

Later, one of my other friends mentioned that they thought my comment was a bit out of line, which made me question if I was being an asshole. I didn’t mean to take away from Sarah’s excitement; I just got carried away in the moment.

I decided to reach out to her, considering I had a little bit of extra time one weekend. I baked some cookies and brought them over to her house as a way to cheer her up.

I tried to engage her in conversation and suggested we could do something everyone would enjoy, but she just brushed it off and seemed disinterested.

No one is the Asshole,"So to give you a bit of context, I’m 17 and I live with my parents. They generally trust me with most things, but they have always been strict about me not using social media until I’m older. They believe it can be harmful and distracting, so they set a rule against it.

Recently, I’ve been really interested in photography and connecting with other young photographers to share tips and get feedback. I explained this to my parents and asked if they would reconsider their stance on social media, since I’d like to create a photography account to showcase my work. I promised them that I would be responsible, set privacy settings, and avoid any negative influences.

They were hesitant but agreed to discuss it further after we had a family dinner. During the dinner, I shared how much I love photography and how social media could help me grow my skills and connect with others who share my passion. They listened but were still worried about the potential risks. 

In the end, they said they would think about it, but I left feeling a bit frustrated. I understand their concerns, but I also feel it’s important for me to express myself creatively. I’m considering proposing a trial period where I can use social media in a controlled way, and if they’re still uncomfortable, we can revisit the topic later.

So, am I the asshole for wanting to have this conversation and try to negotiate with my parents about using social media?",9,692,0.83,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_58242,2021-04-09 00:00:00,NAH,1434,AITA

Recently, we decided to check out a new Asian restaurant that just opened up in our area. Before making a reservation, I called the restaurant to explain my friend's allergy and ask about their procedures for handling allergies. The manager was very understanding and assured me that they take food allergies seriously. They told me they could accommodate us by cleaning their cooking surfaces and using fresh utensils, which made me feel comfortable.

When we arrived, the waiter was informed about my friend's allergy, and he seemed a bit dismissive, which made me uneasy. I expressed my concerns to him again, and he assured me everything would be fine. However, when our food arrived, I noticed that my friend's meal had a garnish that contained peanuts. I immediately flagged it, and the waiter apologized profusely and quickly took the dish back. They offered to remake her meal, but I could tell the kitchen staff was a bit flustered by the whole situation.

While waiting for her new meal, I felt bad for causing a delay and drawing attention to the issue. I didn’t want to be a hassle or make anyone uncomfortable, but my friend’s health was my priority. After we finished our meals, my friend thanked me for being vigilant but also mentioned that she felt embarrassed by the whole thing.

No one is the Asshole,"So, the other day, I (19F) was hanging out with my friends at a local park for a picnic. We all brought different snacks and drinks to share. I decided to bring some homemade cookies and a bottle of sparkling water. As we were setting up, one of my friends, Lisa (20F), arrived with a big bag of chips and a few bottles of soda.

As we were enjoying our snacks, Lisa opened a bottle of soda and started pouring it into cups. I noticed that she had brought a sugary soda that was quite high in calories. I had been trying to reduce my sugar intake lately and was a bit concerned about the amount of sugary drinks we were consuming, especially since we were all college students trying to stay healthy.

I gently suggested that maybe we could mix things up and try some fruit-infused water or something lighter since it was such a beautiful day. I thought it would be a nice alternative to the heavy soda. Lisa shrugged it off and said that everyone loves soda at picnics. I didn't want to seem pushy, so I dropped the subject.

A little while later, as we were all chatting and enjoying our snacks, I overheard Lisa telling another friend that my suggestion was ""health snobbery"" and that I was trying to ruin the fun. I felt a bit hurt because I genuinely just wanted to promote healthier options, not insult anyone. I decided to talk to Lisa privately, explaining that I wasn’t trying to criticize her choices; I just wanted to share alternatives for those who might be interested.

In the end, we had a good conversation, and she understood where I was coming from. She mentioned that it can be hard to have those discussions without feeling judged. We both agreed that everyone's preferences are valid, and it's all about enjoying time together, regardless of what we eat or drink.

At first, my dad was a bit skeptical, but Claire handled it beautifully. She brought a dessert that she knew he loved, and they hit it off right away. They shared stories, laughed, and even reminisced about old family memories. It warmed my heart to see my dad so engaged and happy.

After dinner, I took my dad aside and explained the situation—how I just wanted him to feel reassured that I was doing well and that I had a wonderful friend in my life. He appreciated the honesty and said he was glad I had Claire as a friend. 

By the end of the evening, I think he really understood where I was coming from, and it lifted a weight off both our shoulders. He even joked about having “dinner dates” with Claire more often.

No one is the Asshole,"I hope this isn't too strange of a situation, but I could use some perspectives on what happened recently with my cousin's wedding. 

So, my cousin, who I’ve grown up with, got married last weekend. I was really excited to see her and celebrate, but I had to miss the ceremony because of a last-minute work commitment that I couldn't get out of. I felt terrible about it, but it was unavoidable. I promised her I’d make it to the reception, and I kept that promise.

During the reception, I noticed that my parents and some of the other relatives were talking a lot about how beautiful the ceremony was and how emotional it was. They seemed to be sharing their feelings about it quite openly. I felt really left out and a bit upset that I couldn’t be a part of that special moment.

While we were eating, I shared with my family how I felt sad about missing the ceremony, and I hoped I could hear more about it later. My cousin happened to overhear me and came over to assure me that she totally understood. She said that the day was about celebration and that I was there for the reception, which was what counted. 

However, later on, when I was talking to some family members, I mentioned that I wished I could have seen my cousin's vows and that I felt a little disconnected from the day since I missed it. I didn’t mean to bring the mood down, but a few family members looked at me a bit judgmentally and said things like, “It’s your own fault for not planning better,” which I found a little harsh. I never intended to make it about me or spoil the celebration.

In retrospect, I wonder if I should have just stayed quiet and not expressed my feelings at all. I didn't want to take away from my cousin's big day, but I also wanted to be honest about my disappointment.

No one is the Asshole,"I'm a middle-aged woman, and I’ve always been a bit of a traditionalist when it comes to celebrations. Recently, my younger sister decided to throw a big, modern birthday party for her daughter, who just turned five. The theme was all about unicorns, rainbows, and lots of glitter. 

I felt a bit out of place because my idea of a birthday celebration is more about family gatherings with a nice homemade cake and simple decorations. When I saw the party invitations, I was honestly worried it was going to be too overwhelming for the kids and thought it might be better if we toned it down a bit.

On the day of the party, I mentioned to my sister that I thought the decorations were a bit much and asked if she’d considered a simpler approach for the next year. I didn't mean to offend her; I just thought I was offering helpful advice based on my experiences.

She looked hurt and said that this was her daughter's special day and she wanted it to be magical. I realized that I might have stepped on her toes, and I felt bad because I never wanted to take away from her excitement.

For some background, I'm (25F) currently living with my older brother (30M) and his girlfriend (28F) while I save up for my own apartment. They’ve been really supportive and have made me feel welcome, but I’ve noticed some tension lately.

I have a pretty busy schedule with work and classes, so I often rely on my own routines to keep everything in order. I like to keep my things organized a certain way, especially in shared spaces. I usually wash my own dishes and keep my room tidy, but I do ask for my brother and his girlfriend to respect my privacy and not touch my things without asking.

Recently, I had a stressful week that culminated in a big presentation for work. I came home that evening feeling exhausted, and I wasn’t in the mood for anything extra. That’s when I discovered that my brother’s girlfriend had decided to reorganize my section of the shared kitchen pantry. She moved my food items around and even tossed some of my leftovers that I had been planning to eat.

When I confronted her about it, she seemed genuinely confused. She thought she was doing a good deed by making the space more organized since it was ""a bit cluttered."" I tried to explain that it made me uncomfortable and that I preferred to manage my own space, but she took it personally and said I was being ungrateful for her help. 

My brother got involved, and it turned into a bit of a back-and-forth. I felt bad that my request for personal space came off as an attack on her intentions.

I (29F) have a close friend, Mia (28F), who is getting married next year. She has been planning her wedding for a while now, and I’m super excited for her. However, I’ve noticed she’s been pretty stressed out about the budget. Weddings can be really pricey, and Mia is trying to plan a beautiful day without breaking the bank.

I offered to help her with some of the planning and suggested a few cost-effective ideas that I’ve seen work well in other weddings. One of the suggestions was to consider a smaller venue or even doing a backyard ceremony, which could save a lot of money. Mia seemed receptive to the idea, and we started brainstorming some more options together.

A few days later, Mia told me that she really wants to have a big fancy wedding at a specific venue that she loves, but it’s way over her budget. I totally understand the appeal of that venue—it's beautiful and she has every right to want her dream wedding. However, I gently expressed my concern about the financial strain it could put on her and her fiancé. I didn’t want to come off as pushy or make her feel bad about her choices, but I felt it was important to be honest.

Mia got a little upset and accused me of not supporting her dream. I felt bad because I really do want her to have the wedding she’s always wanted, but I also don’t want her to start her marriage in debt. I apologized for how I phrased things and told her I would support whatever decision she makes, even if it's different from the ones I suggested.

The day before the trip, I realized I had forgotten my sleeping bag at home. I was in a bit of a panic because I knew it could get pretty cold at night. I reached out to the group chat to see if anyone could lend me a spare sleeping bag for the trip. Jamie responded quickly, saying they had an extra one and I could borrow it.

Fast forward to the trip, we arrived at the campsite, set up our tents, and started grilling food. Everything was going smoothly until later in the evening when we were sitting around the campfire. I noticed that Jamie was acting a bit distant. I asked if everything was okay, and they reluctantly mentioned that they were really looking forward to using their sleeping bag that night, which was also the one I was borrowing.

I felt really bad and offered to switch sleeping arrangements so that Jamie could take my sleeping bag instead. They appreciated the offer but insisted that it was fine and they didn’t want to ruin my trip. I assured them that I didn’t want to be uncomfortable if they needed it more.

In the end, I used Jamie’s sleeping bag that night, and they ended up borrowing my extra blanket to stay warm. It was a bit of a compromise, but we both felt better about the situation after talking it through. The trip ended up being a great experience for everyone, and we all had a lot of fun.

When I got back home, I learned that some of our mutual friends were upset about how Jamie had to sacrifice their own comfort for me. They thought I should have just brought my own gear and not relied on others. I felt bad that this situation even caused any tension among the group. So, AITA for borrowing my friend’s sleeping bag and causing some drama?",231,2930,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_20869,2021-08-27 00:00:00,NAH,2068,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"AITA? 

My roommate and I have been living together for a little over a year. We get along well, but we have different cleaning habits. I like to keep things tidy and organized, while he tends to be more laid-back about cleanliness. 

Last week, I noticed that the kitchen was getting pretty messy. There were dirty dishes piling up in the sink, crumbs on the counter, and the trash was full. I decided to take the initiative and clean everything up, hoping to set a good example. I washed the dishes, wiped down the surfaces, and even took out the trash.

When my roommate came home, he saw the clean kitchen and seemed surprised but also a bit annoyed. He said he didn’t think it was necessary for me to clean the kitchen without asking him first and that he felt like I was undermining his way of doing things. I explained that I was just trying to keep our shared space pleasant for both of us and that it made me uncomfortable to live in a messy environment.

He still felt like I overstepped, and I apologized if it came off that way, but I also expressed that I wished he would help out more with maintaining our apartment. We ended up having a calm discussion about our cleaning habits and agreed to set a cleaning schedule moving forward.

So, am I the asshole for cleaning the kitchen without consulting him first, or was I just trying to keep our home nice?",495,1689,0.76,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_25725,2019-04-12 00:00:00,NAH,1368,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, a few weeks ago, I was at a local coffee shop, and I overheard a conversation between two friends at the next table. They were discussing a mutual friend who was going through a tough time after a recent breakup. It sounded like she was feeling really down and isolated, and I felt bad for her. 

I've met her a couple of times and thought she was really sweet, so I decided to reach out. I sent her a message on social media, inviting her to join me for coffee, hoping to cheer her up. She responded positively, and we set a date to meet.

When we met, she seemed really grateful that I reached out, and we talked for a couple of hours. I listened to her, offered some support, and we shared some laughs. Towards the end of our chat, she mentioned that she’d been thinking about organizing a small get-together with some friends to lift her spirits and wanted to know if I’d be interested in helping her with it.

I thought it was a great idea and agreed to help her plan it. We discussed some ideas, and I suggested reaching out to a few other friends of hers to invite them. She loved the idea, and together we created a group chat to plan everything.

However, after a few days, I noticed that some of the friends in the chat were not responding as quickly as I hoped, and it seemed like the enthusiasm was dwindling. I became a little anxious that the get-together might not happen, so I took it upon myself to send a reminder message to everyone in the chat, encouraging them to confirm if they were in or not.

I thought I was being helpful, but it seemed like some of the group felt overwhelmed by my reminders. One friend even messaged me privately, saying they felt pressured and that they appreciated my enthusiasm but needed more time to respond. This made me feel bad because my intention was only to support our mutual friend.

Eventually, we did end up having the get-together, and it was a success. Everyone had a good time, and the friend who had been struggling seemed much happier afterwards. However, I’m still left wondering if I overstepped by being so proactive about the planning. Was I too pushy, or was I just trying to help? Am I the asshole for trying to encourage everyone to participate?

Edit: I’m really glad I reached out to her, and I learned to be more mindful of how I encourage group dynamics in the future. Everyone left the gathering feeling uplifted, and I’m glad I could play a part in that.",200,713,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_62239,2023-08-27 00:00:00,NAH,2436,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, I recently attended a friend’s wedding that was supposed to be a small, intimate gathering. My friend had originally planned for around 50 guests due to budget constraints, but last minute, the bride’s family insisted on inviting an additional 40 people, which made things quite crowded.

During the reception, I noticed one of the newly added guests who seemed a bit out of place and was sitting alone at a table, looking uncomfortable. I knew that the bride and groom didn't really know this person well, and I felt bad seeing someone isolated at such a celebratory event.

I decided to approach this guest, strike up a conversation, and include them in our group. We talked about the couple, shared funny stories, and eventually got the person laughing. They seemed to lighten up and genuinely enjoyed the conversation, which made me feel great.

After a while, I noticed that a couple of my friends were giving me strange looks and whispering among themselves. Later on, one of them approached me and told me that I shouldn't have gone out of my way for that guest since they were essentially a ""plus one"" who didn't fit into the vibe of the original group. They seemed to think I was making things awkward by including someone who didn’t know many people.

I felt a bit conflicted. On one hand, I wanted to make everyone feel welcome, but on the other, I didn’t want to disrupt the wedding or make my friends uncomfortable. I ended up apologizing to my friends for causing any disruption, but I also felt proud of reaching out to someone who needed company.

I’m wondering if I was wrong to include that guest and if my friends were justified in their feelings. What do you think?",133,1349,0.62,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_83926,2019-08-10 00:00:00,NAH,1689,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I've been wrestling with this situation for a while, and I honestly feel conflicted about whether I'm in the wrong. I don’t think anyone is truly at fault, but I’d like to get some outside perspective.

A few months ago, my best friend Lisa went through a really tough breakup. They were together for four years, and it hit her hard. In the beginning, I was there for her—listening, comforting, and helping her process everything. However, as the weeks turned into months, it started taking a toll on my own mental health. 

I noticed that every time we hung out, the conversation would inevitably circle back to her ex. I understood that she had a lot to unload, but it felt like I was stuck in this cycle where I couldn't talk about anything else. I could sense her pain, but it was hard for me to be the constant support without feeling overwhelmed myself.

One day, during one of our conversations, I gently brought up my feelings. I said something like, ""I love you, and I really want to help you through this, but I’ve been feeling pretty drained lately. Can we try to focus on some positive things when we're together?"" I hoped to encourage her to explore other topics, but I could tell she was hurt by my request. She went quiet, and it felt like I had let her down.

After that conversation, she seemed to withdraw a bit, and I felt guilty for making her feel bad when she was already struggling. I didn’t mean to hurt her; I just wanted to find a balance that worked for both of us. I’ve reached out since then to check on her, and we’ve talked about lighter topics, but I can still sense some tension.

So, I’m wondering—am I the asshole for trying to set boundaries for my own mental health, even if it meant hurting my friend in the process? I really care about her and want to support her, but I also need to take care of myself.",223,1809,0.91,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_80281,2018-02-02 00:00:00,NAH,1843,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I recently took a weekend trip with our close friends, who also happen to be a couple. We've been friends for years and usually get along great, but this trip brought up a bit of tension. 

During our stay, we decided to have a group dinner at a nice restaurant. To keep things simple, we split the bill evenly among the four of us. However, when the bill arrived, I noticed that my partner had ordered a much more expensive dish compared to what our friends had chosen. This didn’t bother me initially; I thought it was just a matter of personal preference.

After dinner, our friends expressed feeling a bit uneasy about how much they contributed versus what they ate. They felt like they shouldn’t have had to pay the same amount since they chose less expensive meals. I understood where they were coming from but also thought that splitting the bill evenly was a fair way to handle it, considering we’re all friends and sometimes it’s good to treat each other.

The next day, over breakfast, we talked about the dinner bill. I suggested that maybe next time we could each pay for our own meals to avoid any awkwardness. Our friends seemed to agree but also mentioned that they felt a bit uncomfortable bringing it up at the table because they didn’t want to seem petty. 

I felt caught in the middle, as I didn’t want to undermine my partner’s choice to order what they wanted. But I also didn’t want our friends to feel undervalued or upset about the situation. I apologized for the awkwardness and said we could figure out a better approach for future outings.

Now, I’m left wondering if I should have insisted on paying separately at dinner or if it was fair to stick with the even split. Was I wrong to not consider their feelings more in the moment, or is it normal in friendships to split bills this way? 

So, AITA for wanting to continue splitting the bill evenly despite the discomfort it caused?",622,2022,0.98,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_76316,2022-12-06 00:00:00,NAH,1925,AITA

I noticed that she’s been isolating herself more and skipping plans we had made. I wanted to support her, so I reached out and invited her over for a movie night, hoping it would lift her spirits. She agreed, but as the day approached, she canceled last minute, saying she just wasn't up for it. I completely understood but felt a little worried about her.

The next day, I saw on social media that she was out with another friend, having fun and posting pictures. I felt a mix of emotions—happy she was doing something fun but also hurt that she didn’t want to spend time with me. I decided to send her a message expressing how I felt, saying that I was glad she was finding joy but that it stung to see her out with someone else when she had canceled plans with me.

Sam responded, saying she appreciated my honesty but that she needed to take things day by day and that it wasn’t personal. She explained that she was trying to find some normalcy and sometimes needed to be around different people to cope. I felt bad for putting her in a position where she might feel guilty for seeking support elsewhere, and I apologized for my message.

We ended up having a heart-to-heart about how we both feel and agreed that we care about each other’s well-being. I want to support her without being possessive, and she wants to include me in her recovery process. It felt good to clear the air.

The couple had decided to incorporate some fun games into the reception, which was a great idea. One of the games involved sharing embarrassing stories about the couple, and it was all in good fun—until one of the bride's relatives took it too far. He started telling a story that was not only humiliating but also brought up a sensitive topic that the bride had confided in me about in the past. It was clear that the story was making her uncomfortable, and I could see her trying to smile through it. 

After the relative finished, I felt compelled to step in. I gently explained that while we all love a good laugh, that particular story might not be suitable for the occasion and that it might be better to share something lighter. The relative seemed taken aback, but he quickly apologized and moved on to another topic.

Afterward, the bride approached me and thanked me for saying something, expressing that she felt relieved I had stepped in. My partner felt that I might have embarrassed the relative in front of everyone, though, and I started to second-guess myself. 

I genuinely wanted to protect my friend’s feelings without causing a scene.

I had already told Sarah I would be there, but as the deadline approached, I started to worry that I wouldn’t be able to finish my work if I went out.

On the day of the party, I texted Sarah to let her know I would be arriving late because I needed to wrap up a few things. She was understanding but still a bit disappointed. I promised I would show up as soon as I could.

When I finally arrived at the party, it was already in full swing. I felt bad for missing the earlier festivities, but I was happy to see friends and celebrate Sarah. I made sure to give her a heartfelt gift and spend time catching up with everyone. However, I was still a bit anxious about my work, so I kept checking my phone to see if I had any messages from my client.

At one point, I went outside for a breather and to take a quick call from my client. When I returned inside, Sarah looked a bit upset. I approached her and asked what was wrong. She expressed that she felt like I wasn’t fully present at her birthday party and that I was more focused on work than celebrating with her.

I explained that I was really trying to balance everything and that I genuinely wanted to be there for her. I wasn’t ignoring her; I just felt the pressure from my project. She understood but said it still hurt her feelings. We talked it over, and I reassured her that her birthday was important to me.

In the end, I stayed for the rest of the party, and we both apologized for the misunderstanding. I realized that I could have put my phone away more and focused on being present. Sarah appreciated my effort to celebrate with her, and I felt relieved we could communicate openly.

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I recently decided to move in together after dating for a couple of years. We were both ecstatic about this new chapter in our lives, but it also came with its own set of challenges. One significant hurdle we faced was merging our families. My partner has a younger sister, and I have a younger brother. 

When we announced our plan to move in, both of our siblings were excited but also expressed some concerns. My brother, who is 18, had been living independently and was feeling somewhat protective of me, his older sibling. My partner's sister, who is 16, was nervous about being away from her family dynamics and worried about how things would change.

To ease the transition, we decided to have a family dinner where both siblings could meet and share their feelings. During the dinner, my brother voiced his concerns about me potentially forgetting him or not having enough time for him once I moved in with my partner. He’s always been a bit possessive of our sibling relationship, and while I appreciated his honesty, it was still a tough conversation.

My partner’s sister, on the other hand, expressed her worries about feeling left out or losing her big sister once we started living together. She shared stories about how she looked up to my partner and didn’t want things to change between them either. 

After some back and forth, we all ended up chatting openly about our feelings. I reassured both of them that they wouldn’t lose us and that we could work together to maintain our relationships. My brother suggested we set up a regular sibling night where we all hang out, and my partner's sister liked the idea. It felt like a solid compromise.

However, my partner and I later discussed how emotionally charged the dinner had been. I felt torn; I wanted to support my brother, but I also wanted to embrace this new life with my partner.

They suggested that I could wear headphones while watching TV or use a dimmer light for my late-night activities. I realized they were right, and I genuinely want to make things better for them. 

In turn, I asked if they could be a bit more flexible with their sleep schedule on weekends, as I sometimes want to stay up late on Friday and Saturday nights. They agreed but mentioned that they need their rest to function properly during the week. 

We ended up having a really constructive conversation about our needs and came up with a compromise. I’ll work on being quieter at night, and they’ll allow themselves a bit of flexibility on weekends when I want to stay up late.

AITA for wanting them to adjust their sleep schedule slightly on weekends while I try to be more considerate during the week?",337,957,0.95,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_47366,2019-05-27 00:00:00,NAH,1495,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, I (16f) have a younger brother (12m) who has always looked up to me. We’ve been pretty close, but he often gets really anxious about trying new things. Recently, he decided he wanted to join the school basketball team because he loves watching the games but was terrified of actually playing. 

Knowing he was nervous, I encouraged him to give it a shot. I promised him that I’d help him practice and that it would be fun. After a couple of weeks of practicing together, he seemed to be feeling more confident. However, when tryouts came around, he got really anxious again and almost backed out.

I noticed that he was really upset, so I sat down with him and talked about it. I told him that it was perfectly okay to be scared but that he should at least try. I reminded him that no one expected him to be perfect right away and that the important part was just to have fun and play with his friends. 

He went to the tryouts and ended up making the team, which was super exciting for both of us! The problem is, after the initial excitement, I started to feel like he was leaning on me too much for support. He would always ask me to help with his practices and would get upset if I couldn’t be there every single time. 

I tried to explain to him that I also had my own commitments, like studying and hanging out with friends, but he took it really hard. He said I was abandoning him when he needed me the most, and that made me feel guilty. 

I just wanted to be supportive without feeling like I was responsible for his success. So, I decided to step back a little and let him figure some things out on his own. I still cheer him on during games, but I don’t help him practice as much anymore.

Now he’s mad at me and says I don’t care about him. I feel bad, but I also know that he needs to learn to be a bit more independent and to face challenges without relying solely on me. So I’m wondering if I’m the A-hole for trying to step back and give him space?",137,2759,0.99,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_67625,2018-11-16 00:00:00,NAH,1968,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Recently, I (28F) went on a hiking trip with a group of friends. We’ve all been friends for years, and I was excited to spend the weekend outdoors. On the second day of our trip, one of my friends, Jake (30M), suggested we go on a more challenging trail. I hesitated because I wasn’t sure if I was up for it, but everyone else was really enthusiastic about it, so I reluctantly agreed.

As we started the hike, I quickly realized that it was pushing my limits. I was falling behind, and I could feel myself getting tired and a bit overwhelmed. I didn’t want to hold everyone back, but I also didn’t want to be the only one struggling. When we reached a particularly steep section, I decided to voice my concerns and suggested we take a break. I was feeling anxious and just needed a moment to catch my breath.

My friends were supportive, and we took a break, but I could tell Jake was a bit frustrated because he really wanted to keep going. After our break, we continued on the trail, but I was still lagging behind. At one point, I jokingly said, “Maybe I should just stick to flat walks from now on!” I meant it lightheartedly, but I noticed Jake didn’t laugh and seemed annoyed.

Later that evening, around the campfire, Jake brought it up again, saying that I should have just pushed myself more instead of speaking up about my limits. He mentioned that it’s all part of the adventure and seemed to imply that I was being overly cautious. I felt a bit hurt because I thought I was being honest and responsible by sharing how I felt.

I told him that everyone has different comfort levels and that it’s okay to voice when we’re not feeling up to something, especially in a group setting. The conversation got a little tense, and while the others tried to mediate, it ended up feeling awkward for the rest of the night.

I’ve been reflecting on whether I should have just sucked it up and kept quiet to avoid any tension or if it was reasonable to express my limits. I don’t want to create drama in our group, but I also want to be honest about my feelings.

However, the day before the party, one of my close friends had a family emergency and asked if I could help her with some things while she dealt with it. She needed someone to watch her kids for a few hours and help her organize some paperwork. I wanted to be there for her, but I also felt guilty about missing my friend's birthday party since he had been looking forward to it.

After discussing it with my friend going through the emergency, she assured me that it would mean a lot to her if I could help. So, I decided to prioritize helping her over attending the party. I sent a message to the birthday friend explaining the situation and offering to celebrate with him another time.

When I eventually saw him the next week, he seemed a bit disappointed but understood. I felt torn because I wanted to be there for both friends, but I couldn’t split myself in two. 

As I reflected on the situation, I wondered if I had made the right choice. My intention was to be supportive, but I didn’t want to let anyone down.

No one is the Asshole,"Throwaway account because I need to share this without any bias. I'm 28 and work as a barista in a coffee shop. Recently, I started a small side business selling handmade candles, which I really love doing. I invested my savings into materials and have been getting some good sales at local markets.

Last weekend, I had a market set up and I was so excited. A few of my friends came to support me, which meant a lot. While I was there, one of my friends, Sarah, told me that she was going through a rough time financially. She mentioned that she was struggling to pay her rent and was thinking about getting a second job, which I totally understood.

Without thinking, I offered her a few candles for free, thinking it might help brighten her day a bit. She was grateful, but then later on, another friend, Mike, expressed that he felt uncomfortable with me giving her free stuff because he thought it wasn't fair to other vendors who had to pay for their products. He said it could devalue the market. I felt caught off guard because I was just trying to help someone I care about.

After the market, the vibe felt a bit tense between us. I wasn’t trying to undercut anyone; I just wanted to show support. I ended up feeling guilty and like I might have done something wrong by helping my friend. 

Now I'm wondering if I overstepped by giving her the candles, or if Mike was being too harsh about the situation. I believe I acted out of kindness, but I can see his point as well.

I decided to spend some time fixing it up, and I mentioned to my best friend that I wanted to use it as a centerpiece in our living room. My friend was excited about the idea and suggested that we could paint it together. I thought it was a great bonding activity, and we planned a weekend to work on it.

However, a week later, my friend’s boyfriend, who is also my friend, casually mentioned that he had a similar bookshelf and was considering painting it a bright color. When my friend heard this, she suggested that we could do something similar with my grandmother's bookshelf, but I wasn’t sure about painting it. I felt like it was a piece that held sentimental value, and I wanted to keep it as close to its original state as possible.

When I expressed my concerns, my friend seemed disappointed and said that it would be more fun to have a vibrant color. I explained why it was important to me to preserve it as it was, and we ended up having a bit of a disagreement. It felt like I was being too rigid, but I also didn’t want to compromise on something so dear to me.

Ultimately, we decided to leave the bookshelf as it is for now, but I could sense there was some tension. I appreciate my friend’s enthusiasm, but I also feel like I have to stand my ground on what I value.

My sister and I have been planning a family reunion for months. It's a big deal because our family is quite scattered, and we wanted everyone to come together. My sister took the lead on organizing the event, and I helped by reaching out to family members and coordinating food.

As the date approached, my sister got overwhelmed with the logistics and started to stress out. One night, she called me in tears, worried that she wouldn't be able to handle everything. I assured her that we would figure it out together and suggested that we delegate some tasks to other family members who had offered to help.

On the day of the reunion, my sister was running around trying to get everything set up while I was busy cooking. When it came time to serve the food, I noticed that she had set up the dessert table right next to the main food area, which was causing a bottleneck as people tried to get both. I gently suggested that she move the dessert table to the other side of the room to make it easier for everyone to access the food.

She got really defensive and snapped at me, saying she was doing her best and didn’t need my input. I felt bad and backed off, but the rest of the day felt tense between us. 

After the reunion, I reached out to her to apologize for saying anything that upset her. She acknowledged that she was stressed, but still felt like I was undermining her efforts.

I wanted to share a situation that happened recently and get some perspective on it. 

A few weeks ago, my close friend was going through a tough time after a breakup. I wanted to be supportive, so I organized a small get-together at my place with a few mutual friends to cheer her up. We planned a fun night with games, snacks, and her favorite movies.

The day before, she called me to say she was feeling overwhelmed and might not be able to make it. I completely understood and told her not to worry, and that we could always reschedule. However, as the evening approached, I thought it would be nice to send her a quick video of our gathering to show her that we were all thinking of her and that she'd be missed.

I sent her a lighthearted video of us laughing and having fun, but she responded quite upset, saying that it felt like we were having fun without her and that it compounded her feelings of loneliness.

I felt bad because my intention was to include her and make her feel connected, but I didn’t consider how it might come off. I apologized and reassured her that we were missing her and that we could plan something special for just the two of us soon.

In hindsight, I can see how my attempt to cheer her up might have backfired. So, was I the asshole for sending her that video in the first place, or was she just having a tough time?

A few months ago, I found out that my best friend from college is getting married in a few weeks, and I was thrilled to be invited as one of the guests.

I told my manager about the wedding as soon as I received the invitation, and I requested the day off well ahead of time.

I approached my manager again, explaining how important this wedding was to me and reiterating my request for the day off. My manager seemed a bit annoyed and said that they couldn’t accommodate me since we had several other people requesting the same day off for various reasons.

I asked if they would be willing to swap shifts with me, and thankfully, one of them agreed to cover for me. I then went back to my manager to let them know that I had arranged coverage and would be attending the wedding.

I'm a 28-year-old woman, and I grew up in a close-knit family where traditions and family gatherings were incredibly important. My family has always placed a strong emphasis on celebrating holidays together, and one of our most cherished traditions is gathering for Thanksgiving every year. 

A few years ago, I moved to a different city for work, and it became challenging to make it home for every holiday. This year, I decided to spend Thanksgiving with a close friend who shares similar dietary preferences and is also unable to go home. We planned a small, cozy gathering, complete with a delicious vegan feast.

A week before Thanksgiving, my parents called to confirm the plans for our usual family gathering. I felt a pang of guilt but explained that I wouldn’t be able to make it this year because of my prior commitment. They were disappointed but tried to be understanding. However, my mom later mentioned that my absence would be felt and that it was ""not the same"" without me. 

On the day of Thanksgiving, I sent my family a text message wishing them a wonderful holiday and expressing how much I missed them. To my surprise, my dad replied with a message that I shouldn’t underestimate how much being together means to our family. I felt torn. I love my family, and I cherish our traditions, but I also wanted to create new memories and enjoy the holiday in my own way.

Jane is a great planner, but she tends to overthink things, and it often leads to her feeling overwhelmed. I could sense her anxiety building over the weeks leading up to the trip. She was constantly talking about wanting everything to be perfect, from the itinerary to the meals. I tried to reassure her that we just wanted to relax and have fun, but she kept stressing out about the details.

About a week before the trip, Jane texted me with a long list of things she wanted to do and bring. She was especially focused on making sure we had a great dinner planned for the first night. I could tell she was really anxious, so I suggested that we keep it simple. I offered to bring the food for the first night, something easy like burgers and salad, and let her focus on other activities.

Jane responded positively at first, but then she started to backtrack. She said she appreciated my offer but wanted to do it her way, insisting she had everything under control. I didn’t want to push too hard, so I backed off and let her handle it. 

When we got to the cabin, Jane was still very stressed. She ended up spending most of the first day in the kitchen preparing a complicated meal, which took hours. Mark and I tried to help, but she insisted on doing it all herself. By the time dinner was ready, she was exhausted and clearly frustrated. 

After dinner, I gently brought up how I had offered to help, and maybe we could have saved her some stress. She snapped at me, saying I didn’t understand how important it was for her to have everything go according to her plans. I felt bad because I didn’t want to hurt her feelings, but I also wanted her to know that I was there to support her.

We eventually talked it out later that night, and she admitted that she appreciated my willingness to help but felt like she needed to prove she could do it all herself. I told her that I believed in her, but it was okay to lean on friends too. We ended up having a good conversation, but I still felt uneasy about how things had gone.

Looking back, I wonder if I should have pushed harder to help her, or if I should just have let her do things her way despite the stress it caused her. AITA for trying to help but also respecting her wishes?",897,2909,0.6,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_84452,2020-11-22 00:00:00,NAH,2565,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I (35M) recently had to navigate a challenging situation with my best friend (36M), who lost his job due to company downsizing. He was understandably upset and unsure about what to do next. In an effort to support him, I offered him a place to stay at my apartment while he looked for new opportunities.

Initially, everything seemed to be going well, but after a couple of weeks, I started to feel overwhelmed by the arrangement. My friend is a wonderful guy, but he has a habit of staying up late and playing video games loudly, which disrupted my work-from-home routine. I tried to bring it up casually, but he didn't seem to get the hint.

One night, after a particularly long workday, I snapped and expressed my frustrations. I told him that while I wanted to support him, I needed him to respect my space and keep the noise down during my working hours. He was hurt and felt like I was being an asshole for not being more understanding of his situation.

The next day, I apologized for how I handled it and we had a long talk. I told him I didn’t want to push him away but needed to create balance in our living situation. We came to an agreement that he would try to keep the noise down during my work hours, and in return, I would be more patient with him during this tough time.

Now, we’re both feeling better about the arrangement, but I can't shake the feeling that I may have come off as unsympathetic initially. AITA?",50,1185,0.51,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_81090,2021-05-29 00:00:00,NAH,1431,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Good Evening Reddit,

I hope you all are doing well. I wanted to share a situation that has been weighing on me lately and get some outside perspective on whether I’m in the wrong.

A few months ago, my best friend, Sarah, experienced a devastating loss when her mother passed away after a long battle with cancer. It was incredibly hard for her, and I tried to support her as best as I could. I was there for her during the funeral and helped organize meals for her family. 

Sarah had a very close-knit group of friends, and after the funeral, we decided to throw a small memorial gathering to celebrate her mother’s life. We all pitched in to cover the costs, which included food, drinks, and some flowers. It was a beautiful evening where we shared stories, laughed, and cried together.

However, during the gathering, I noticed one of our mutual friends, Jenna, being a bit insensitive. She made a few comments that seemed to belittle the emotional atmosphere, like joking about how Sarah's mom would probably be rolling in her grave over some of our choices. I felt that it was inappropriate and expressed my discomfort to Jenna afterwards, in a calm manner, letting her know that it wasn't the time or place for such jokes.

Jenna took it very personally and accused me of being overly sensitive and ruining the spirit of the evening. This led to a bit of a confrontation, and I ended up saying that she should have respected the occasion more. I didn’t mean to escalate things, but I felt strongly about the need for compassion in that moment.

The aftermath has been awkward. While Sarah appreciated my support, Jenna has been upset with me, and our friend group is divided. I don’t think I was wrong to address the situation, but I can see how it may have come off as harsh.

So, am I the asshole for confronting Jenna about her comments? Or was I justified in wanting to protect Sarah's feelings? I’m just trying to figure out if I overstepped my bounds.

No one is the Asshole,"My friend Sarah and I have known each other for over a decade; we’ve been through a lot together. Recently, she started a new job that has been really demanding, with long hours and tight deadlines. I’ve always been supportive of her career, but it seems like it’s starting to take a toll on her mental health. She often comes to our hangouts visibly stressed and exhausted, which makes it hard for us to enjoy our time together.

I noticed that she tends to cancel plans last minute or leaves early because she feels overwhelmed with work. I tried to be understanding, but it’s been hard for me as well, as I feel like I’m losing a close friend to her job. I’ve talked to her about how I feel, but she brushes it off and says she just needs to get through this busy period.

A couple of weeks ago, I had a moment of frustration and suggested that we set aside time every week to have a break, like a game night or movie night, and make it a priority despite her workload. I thought it could help her unwind and bring some normalcy back into her life. She agreed, but when the first game night came around, she texted me a few hours before to say she needed to work late. I felt disappointed and a little hurt, but I understood that her job was overwhelming.

So, I decided to take it upon myself to plan the next hangout and invited a couple of mutual friends. I hoped that having a group would encourage her to join us. I sent out a group message saying, “Let’s all get together on Saturday! We can play games and just relax.” Sarah responded enthusiastically at first, but then later said she had a work deadline and couldn’t make it. 

I respected her decision, but a part of me wished she could prioritize our friendship a bit more. I ended up hosting the game night with the others, and it was a great time, but I felt guilty about planning something without her. When I told her about it later, she seemed upset, saying that she felt left out and that it hurt to know we had fun without her.

I didn’t intend to exclude her; I just wanted to create a space for us to reconnect. I’m really caught up in wanting to help her, but I also don’t want to push too hard. I feel like I’m walking a fine line between being supportive and being pushy.

No one is the Asshole,"I've been living in my current apartment for about two years now, and generally, I get along well with my neighbors. Recently, a new family moved in next door, and they have a young son who seems to be a bit shy.

A couple of days ago, I was getting ready to head out and was in a bit of a rush. As I was leaving my apartment, I accidentally knocked over a potted plant, and dirt went everywhere. I quickly started cleaning it up, but I was stressed and worried I'd be late for an appointment. 

While I was cleaning, I heard a knock on my door. It was the new neighbor and his son. The boy looked a bit scared and pointed at the mess, saying it looked like “a big mess.” I could tell the dad was trying to reassure him, but I felt embarrassed and a bit flustered.

I apologized for the mess and explained that I was just in a hurry and didn’t mean to make a scene. The dad smiled but said that his son sometimes gets anxious with unexpected situations, and he was worried the mess might be upsetting to him. I felt terrible and tried to reassure both of them that everything was okay, but I was still anxious myself about being late. 

After chatting for a moment, I said I needed to finish cleaning up and get going but that they were welcome to come by anytime to say hi. I think my anxious energy left them feeling a bit uneasy, and I regretted that. 

I’ve been thinking about it since then and wondering if I came off as rude or dismissive when all I wanted was to clean up and leave. So, am I the asshole for being a bit frazzled and unintentionally making my new neighbors uncomfortable?",453,1548,0.94,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_26418,2021-12-06 00:00:00,NAH,1595,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I hope this is the right place to share my story. I'm in a bit of a complicated situation, and I could use some outside perspectives.

So, a few months ago, my younger sister, who is 20, came to live with me after a difficult breakup. I was happy to help, as she needed a fresh start, and I have a spare room in my apartment. Things were going well initially; we bonded over late-night movie marathons and cooking dinner together. 

However, a couple of weeks ago, I found out that she had started seeing a guy (let’s call him Jake) who I wasn’t very fond of. I had met him a few times, and I just got a bad vibe from him. He seemed overly possessive and manipulative, and I worried that he might not treat her well. I voiced my concerns to her, trying to be supportive while still expressing my unease.

At first, she appreciated my honesty, but soon she became defensive, insisting that I was being judgmental and that she could make her own decisions. I didn’t want to push her away, so I tried to back off, but it was hard seeing her so infatuated with someone I felt was a bad influence.

Things came to a head when I discovered that Jake had been staying over at my place without my knowledge. I confronted my sister about it, and she got really upset, accusing me of trying to control her life. I told her that I didn’t feel comfortable with him staying in my home, especially since I had my own boundaries and concerns about his behavior.

After a heated argument, she decided to move out and stay with a friend for a while. I felt awful; I never wanted to push her away or make her feel like she had to choose between me and her relationship. I just wanted to protect her.

Now I’m left feeling guilty, wondering if I overstepped my bounds and if my concerns were valid or just me being overprotective. Did I handle this situation poorly, or was I justified in wanting to keep my home a safe space?

I’m not sure if I’m the bad guy here or if my sister is being unreasonable in her reaction. What do you all think?",736,1140,0.59,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_96209,2022-07-01 00:00:00,NAH,2023,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I (34f) recently had a disagreement with my sister (30f) about our family gatherings. Growing up, our parents always emphasized the importance of family, and I still hold that value close to my heart. I have two kids (8f & 5m) and I try to organize monthly get-togethers, which I believe help strengthen our family bond.

However, my sister has become increasingly resistant to these gatherings. She feels overwhelmed with her job and personal life, and she believes that forcing family time adds to her stress. At first, I tried to plan events that were more casual, like just getting together for dinner or a picnic, but she still declined most of the time. 

I understand that everyone has their own life and responsibilities, but I can't help feeling hurt that she doesn't want to spend time with our family. After a few months of frustration, I brought it up to her, expressing that I miss her and our time together. I suggested we could be more flexible with the gatherings, perhaps making them less frequent or even just smaller, but she felt I was pressuring her.

After our conversation, I realized that I was coming from a place of wanting to connect, but I may not have fully understood her perspective. We ended up having a long talk where I apologized if I made her feel pressured, and she acknowledged that she does value family but struggles with her current stress levels. 

Now we're trying to find a middle ground. She’s suggested that we have a family gathering every couple of months instead of monthly, and I think that’s a reasonable compromise. 

So, AITA for wanting to maintain family traditions while not realizing how much pressure it was putting on my sister?",46,1109,0.98,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_53746,2022-06-24 00:00:00,NAH,1687,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I (30F) recently started a new job and began sharing an office with a colleague, Alex (28M). We have similar work schedules and quickly fell into a routine of collaborating on projects and having lunch together. However, I noticed that Alex often brings in a lot of snacks for himself, which he tends to keep in our shared office. At first, it was just some granola bars and nuts, but soon it escalated to a mini-fridge filled with various items, including cookies, chips, and even homemade treats.

I didn't mind at first, but the clutter became overwhelming. The fridge was packed to the brim, and our shared space started to feel less like a professional environment and more like a personal kitchen. I also started to feel uncomfortable when I would occasionally snack from his stash because I didn’t want to come off as rude or impolite.

One day, I gently brought it up, mentioning that it might be nice to keep the office a bit more organized and suggest we limit snacks to a smaller amount. Alex seemed a bit taken aback and mentioned that he enjoys having snacks around to keep his energy up during the workday. I could tell he felt defensive, and I didn't want to hurt his feelings, so I apologized if I overstepped.

After some back-and-forth, we came to a compromise: we agreed to share the snacks but set a limit on what could be kept in the office and how often we’d replenish them together. We also decided to designate a specific space for our snacks to keep things tidy. 

In the end, I think we both learned to communicate better about our shared space while still respecting each other’s preferences.

I usually work from home, and my partner works long hours at an office. To make things easier, I typically take care of most of the dog walking during the week. However, on the weekends, my partner likes to take him out for longer walks to spend quality time together. This past Saturday, I was feeling particularly tired and just wanted to catch up on some rest after a hectic week. I suggested that my partner take the dog out for the morning walk alone while I slept in a bit. 

My partner agreed but was a little frustrated that I didn't want to join them. They felt I was being unfair by not helping out more during the weekends. I explained that I really needed the rest to recharge, and I would happily take the dog out later in the day when I felt more awake. 

We ended up having a conversation about our expectations and the balance of responsibilities for the dog. I realized I could do better at communicating my need for rest, and my partner understood that I was not trying to shirk responsibility. 

In the end, we both wanted what was best for our dog and each other, but emotions ran a bit high during the discussion. We agreed to find a better balance moving forward and to check in with each other about how we’re feeling regarding our schedules and responsibilities.

I had brought a deck of cards with me, thinking it would be a fun way to pass the time, so I offered to play a quick game with the kids.

Last weekend, my partner and I decided to throw a small gathering at our place with a few close friends. We were all excited to catch up, share some laughs, and enjoy good food together. I had prepared a big meal, and my partner set up an awesome playlist for the night.

As the evening went on, one of our friends, Sarah, suggested a game of charades to liven things up. It was a great idea, and everyone was on board. While playing, things got a bit competitive, and we were all having a blast. I remember one round when I was acting out a movie, and in my enthusiasm, I tripped over the coffee table while trying to make a dramatic gesture.

I fell right into our friend Mike, who was seated nearby. In an attempt to catch me, he ended up knocking over his drink all over himself, and we both ended up laughing uncontrollably on the floor. It was a silly moment but also slightly embarrassing for both of us. Sarah, however, found it particularly hilarious and couldn't stop laughing, which made the rest of us laugh even harder.

After a few moments of laughter, Mike stood up, still chuckling but a bit embarrassed about his drink-spilling incident. I felt bad that I had caused him to spill, so I offered to get him a towel and some more drinks. He said it was all good and that he enjoyed the moment. We all agreed it was a hilarious highlight of the night.

Later, I noticed that Mike was a little quieter than usual, and I asked him if he was okay. He assured me he was fine, but I sensed he was feeling a bit self-conscious about the drink spill.

No one is the Asshole,"I have a friend, Sarah, who has a passion for gardening and has been cultivating a beautiful vegetable garden in her backyard for the past few years. She's very proud of her work and often shares her harvest with friends. However, she tends to be very particular about her garden and can get a bit defensive if anyone suggests changes or offers unsolicited advice.

Recently, I hosted a small gathering at my house, and I invited Sarah. After the party, I noticed some of my guests had thrown their leftover food scraps into my compost bin without thinking much of it. I didn't mind; I actually thought it was a nice gesture since composting helps enrich the soil.

A few days later, I visited Sarah and mentioned how I had been composting the scraps. She immediately expressed concern that my compost bin was attracting pests and could potentially carry diseases. I appreciated her concern but felt she was being overly dramatic. I tried to lighten the mood by jokingly saying, ""Well, if I can grow vegetables like yours, maybe pests are just a sign of a good compost!""

She didn't take it well and ended up getting upset, insisting that I should be more careful about what I compost. I felt caught off guard because I was just trying to share my excitement about composting, and I didn’t mean to offend her.

In hindsight, I see that she was just looking out for my garden and wanted to share her experience. I didn't mean to dismiss her concerns, but I felt her reaction was a bit over the top. So, I'm wondering if I was out of line for joking about it, or if she was just being overly sensitive about her gardening. Am I the asshole for not taking her seriously, or are we both just trying to look out for each other in our own ways?",39,2785,0.8,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_22579,2020-04-30 00:00:00,NAH,1738,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, I grew up in a small town where community and family gatherings are really important. Every year, we have a big summer festival where everyone comes together to celebrate, eat, and enjoy each other's company. It's a great tradition that brings the whole town together, and I've always loved being a part of it.

This year, my neighbor, who is also a close friend, decided to take on the responsibility of organizing the festival. He was super excited and had some great ideas to make it even better. However, he also wanted to make it more extravagant than in previous years, and that meant spending quite a bit more money than we typically would. 

As someone who is passionate about the festival, I was initially on board with the idea. However, as the planning progressed, I started to feel anxious about the budget. I know that not everyone in our community has the financial means to contribute or participate in a more expensive event, and I worried that the festival would start to feel exclusive rather than inclusive.

One day, I brought my concerns up to my friend. I tried to express my feelings delicately, emphasizing how much I value our community and the inclusiveness of the festival. Unfortunately, my friend took it personally and felt like I was attacking his vision. We ended up having a heated discussion, and it made things a bit awkward between us.

After we cooled off, we talked again and both recognized that we want the best for our community. We decided to compromise—he would still implement some of his ideas, but we would also focus on keeping certain aspects more affordable for everyone.

I feel like we both had valid points, and neither of us intended to upset the other. AITA for wanting to maintain the festival's inclusivity while my friend wanted to make it bigger and better?",354,782,0.9,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_93676,2023-02-15 00:00:00,NAH,1819,AITA

Our mutual friends have noticed how we’re practically inseparable, and it’s great! However, my friend recently got engaged, and she’s been planning her wedding for the last few months.

She decided to have a small engagement party and asked me to help with the planning. I was thrilled to be involved! But as we started discussing the details, I learned that she wanted to invite a lot of people, including some from her extended family that I’ve never met. I shared my concerns about the party becoming too large and chaotic, especially since I wanted it to be intimate and focused on her.

After a few discussions, it became clear that she was set on inviting everyone. I didn’t want to hurt her feelings, but I also felt overwhelmed by the prospect of managing such a large event. In the end, I decided to step back from planning and just attend the party as a guest. I explained my decision to her, saying that I still wanted to celebrate but didn’t feel comfortable taking a backseat in a much larger setup than we initially envisioned.

My friend seemed a bit hurt but acknowledged my feelings. We talked about how we could still keep it special for her, even if it was bigger than I had anticipated.

So, AITA for stepping back from planning my best friend’s engagement party when it became too big for my comfort level?",348,2695,0.97,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_14860,2022-03-13 00:00:00,NAH,1437,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Last weekend, I hosted a small get-together at my apartment for some friends. We had a cozy night planned with snacks, games, and catching up. One of my friends, Mia, brought her new boyfriend, Jake, who I hadn’t met before.

During the evening, we decided to play charades, and it turned out to be a lot of fun. At one point, Mia was acting out a movie, and Jake was trying to guess. He was really enthusiastic about it and laughing along, which was great to see.

However, at some point during the game, I noticed that Jake was starting to struggle to guess the answers. He got a bit frustrated and, in a moment of joking, I said, “Come on, man, it’s not like you’re playing against rocket scientists here!” I thought it was a light-hearted comment meant to diffuse the tension, and everyone laughed, including Jake.

But later that night, Mia pulled me aside and said that Jake actually felt embarrassed by my comment. She explained that he had struggled academically in the past and didn’t take jokes about intelligence well, even if they were meant in jest. I was surprised because I had no idea about his background and didn’t mean to upset him.

I apologized to Mia and asked if she could pass on my apology to Jake. She said she would, but I still felt terrible for unintentionally making him feel bad during what was supposed to be a fun night.

I discussed it with a couple of other friends after the event, and they reassured me that it was an innocent mistake, but I still can’t shake off the feeling that I might have crossed a line. I want to be more mindful in the future, especially with new people in our group.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently had a situation with my close friend that left me feeling a bit uneasy, and I wanted to get some perspectives on it. A few weeks ago, my friend invited me to a small gathering at their house to celebrate their birthday. It was supposed to be an intimate get-together with just a few friends, and I was really looking forward to it.

Here’s where it gets tricky: I had a prior commitment that I had completely forgotten about until the day before. I had promised to help my neighbor move on the same day as my friend’s birthday party. I felt terrible about it, but I knew I couldn't back out of helping my neighbor, especially since they were counting on me. So, I sent my friend a message explaining the situation and apologizing for missing the celebration.

My friend responded that they were disappointed and wished I could have made it, but they understood. Later, I learned from another mutual friend that my absence was a big topic of discussion during the party, and my friend seemed quite upset about it. I felt guilty, thinking maybe I should have prioritized the birthday celebration over the commitment to my neighbor.

A few days after the party, I reached out to my friend to check in and see how they were doing. I told them again that I was really sorry for missing their birthday and that I hoped they had a great time. They assured me that it was fine, but I could sense a lingering disappointment.

Now, I’m starting to feel like I may have been inconsiderate by not being there for my friend’s special day, even though I had a valid reason.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I have a situation that I’m trying to figure out if I was in the wrong or not.

A couple of weeks ago, my friend had a small get-together at her place. It was mainly a chill evening with a few close friends, and we were all excited to catch up. She made a delicious dinner, and we were having a great time. However, when it came time for dessert, my friend brought out a cake that she had baked herself.

Now, I have a pretty severe gluten intolerance, and while I usually try to avoid putting a damper on things, I realized I couldn’t eat the cake. I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it, but I politely mentioned my restriction and said that I wouldn’t be able to have any. My friend was super understanding, and she even offered to make me a gluten-free dessert another time, which I thought was really sweet.

However, one of the other guests overheard our conversation and chimed in, saying something along the lines of, “You should just try a little, it can’t be that bad.” I felt really uncomfortable and explained that it actually makes me quite sick. They didn’t seem to take me seriously and kept insisting I should give it a go.

After a few more back-and-forths, I finally said, “Look, I appreciate your concern, but I really can’t risk it. I’d rather not be in pain for the rest of the evening.” I felt a bit frustrated but tried to keep my tone light.

In the end, my friend changed the topic and we moved on, but I was left feeling a bit awkward about the whole interaction. I know they were probably just trying to be helpful, but I felt like I had to stand firm about my health.

No one is the Asshole,"So, here’s the situation.

My partner and I have been together for three years. We both have large families, and holidays can get pretty hectic. Normally, we alternate holidays between our families, but this year, we decided to spend Christmas with my family because we spent Thanksgiving with hers. 

A week before Christmas, my mom called me in a panic because my grandmother had fallen and was in the hospital. She was worried about how to handle the holiday, and I felt it was really important for us to be there to support her and the rest of the family. I talked to my partner about it, and she completely understood my need to be with my family during this time.

However, as Christmas approached, my grandmother’s condition worsened, and my mom was really stressed out. I suggested to my partner that we host a small holiday gathering for my family at our place on Christmas Eve and then go to my mom’s for Christmas Day. This way, we could still celebrate together and support my family. She seemed a bit hesitant, saying she didn’t want to impose on my family’s grief and thought we should just focus on them.

I understood her concerns, but I felt like celebrating together could also provide some comfort. We ended up having a long discussion about it, and while she agreed to my plan, I could sense that she was still uncomfortable. I tried to reassure her that my family would appreciate the effort and that we could find a way to make it a positive experience for everyone.

On Christmas Eve, the gathering went well, and my family really appreciated it. The next day, we went to my mom’s house, and it was a tough day. Everyone was trying to hold it together, but there was a lot of tension. My partner seemed a bit out of place and kept whispering to me how she felt awkward. I understood, and I tried to include her in conversations, but it was clear that the situation was hard for her.

After the holidays, we talked about the experience, and she expressed that she felt bad for not wanting to celebrate originally, but she also felt overwhelmed at my family’s house. I reassured her that it was okay to feel that way, and I appreciated her support during a difficult time.

In the end, I don’t think either of us was wrong. We were both trying to navigate a tough situation as best as we could, and I believe we both cared about each other’s families.

However, Alex mentioned that he was planning to come out to his parents soon. I hesitated for a moment and then shared my concerns. His parents are quite traditional and, to be honest, I’ve seen how they react to things they don’t agree with. Last year, they disowned a family member for marrying someone outside their religion, and I worry they might react similarly to Alex’s transition.

I suggested that he might want to wait a little longer before coming out to them, especially since he’s currently in a delicate situation with his job. He’s up for a promotion, and I told him that it might be better to wait until he feels more secure in both his personal and professional life. I felt that it was reasonable advice since I genuinely care about his well-being and want him to be safe.

Alex was initially upset and felt that I was asking him to hide who he is. I assured him that wasn’t my intention, and I just wanted him to consider the timing carefully. After we talked it out, he appreciated my perspective, even if he didn’t fully agree with it. He ultimately decided to take some time to think it over and said he valued my input.

Later, I shared my concerns with my partner, who said I might have been overstepping and that I should have just let Alex choose his own timing. I understand their point, but I still feel like I was coming from a place of care and concern for my best friend.

I think she felt I wasn’t supportive enough, while I felt she was becoming too controlling, especially around family gatherings. After a few months of silence, we finally decided to clear the air and had an open conversation about our feelings.

During this talk, we both acknowledged our missteps. I admitted I had been distant and could have reached out more, while she recognized that she was putting pressure on me to conform to her ideas of family traditions. We agreed to work on improving our communication and rebuilding our relationship, but it was a slow process.

Recently, she invited me to her son's birthday party. I was excited to go, but as I arrived, I noticed she had set up a big family photo booth area. She asked if I would take some photos with her family, but I hesitated. I felt a bit out of place because I didn’t have kids and wasn’t part of that traditional family unit she had created. 

When I told her I was uncomfortable being in the photos, she looked hurt and said it was important to her to include me. I eventually agreed, but I could sense that my reluctance dampened the mood. After the party, she reached out to thank me for coming but mentioned she was a bit disappointed I didn’t fully embrace being part of the family in that moment.

I felt guilty for making her feel that way, but I also knew it wasn’t fair to force myself into situations where I felt uncomfortable.

I wanted to share this journey with my partner, so I invited them to join me in cooking some of these meals.

However, my partner is a staunch meat lover and has always preferred meals centered around meat. When I suggested we try some of my new vegetarian recipes, they seemed skeptical but agreed to try it out. The first few meals went okay, but I noticed they weren’t very enthusiastic about the dishes and often commented that they felt “unsatisfied” without meat in the meal.

Feeling a bit discouraged but still hopeful, I decided to prepare a full week of vegetarian dinners, thinking it might help them get used to it. I was excited to show them the variety and deliciousness of these meals. But when the week rolled around, my partner expressed frustration and said they didn’t want to eat vegetarian for an entire week. They felt it was too restrictive and missed their favorite meat-based dishes.

I understood where they were coming from, but I was also disappointed because I had invested time and effort into these meals. After discussing it, we came to an agreement that we could alternate meals — I would make vegetarian dishes a few nights a week, and we would also include some of their favorite meat-based recipes. This way, both of us could enjoy what we like without feeling pressured.

In the end, I think we both learned a bit about compromise and communication. I’m happy that we found a way to incorporate both our preferences.

However, one of my friends, who is more of a casual environmentalist, expressed that they didn't really see the point of the whole thing. They felt it was too much work for minimal impact and suggested we just buy our produce from the store instead.

Last week, after she suggested a game that none of us wanted to play, I politely said, “Hey, maybe we can stick to the games we usually enjoy tonight?” She got really defensive and said that my brother should have the freedom to explore new games and that I was being ""controlling."" My brother looked visibly uncomfortable, and I felt bad for putting him in that position, but I was just trying to keep our tradition alive.

After that, my brother talked to me privately and said he understood where I was coming from but also wanted to make his girlfriend feel welcome. He mentioned that he’d like to find a balance where everyone could contribute to game night. I agreed to be more open to new games, but I also wanted to ensure that our original traditions weren’t lost in the process.

The next game night, I tried to be more accommodating, but when she suggested a game that went on for hours and nobody was enjoying it, I eventually spoke up again. I said, “I think we need a break from this one; let’s play something we all actually like.” She ended up leaving early, and my brother was upset because I “ruined it” for them. 

I feel torn because I want to honor our family tradition, but I also want my brother to be happy in his new relationship. I can see both sides of this, and I don’t want to come off as the bad guy here.

No one is the Asshole,"My friend Jenna and I have been close since college, and we’ve always been there for each other through thick and thin. A few months ago, Jenna confided in me that she was dealing with some mental health issues and was struggling to find a good therapist who was a good fit for her. I offered to help her look for options, and I spent a significant amount of time researching therapists, reading reviews, and even calling a few to gather information.

Eventually, I found a therapist I thought would be perfect for her. I shared the details with Jenna, who seemed excited about the match and scheduled an appointment. However, after her first session, she told me she didn’t like the therapist’s approach and didn’t feel comfortable. I felt bad that my recommendation didn’t work out, but I encouraged her to keep trying and offered to help her find someone else.

A couple of weeks later, Jenna reached out to tell me she’d found a therapist on her own and felt much better about this choice. I was genuinely happy for her, but later on, during a conversation with mutual friends, Jenna jokingly mentioned how I had “ruined” her chances of finding a good therapist with my recommendation. While it was said in a lighthearted tone, I couldn’t help but feel a bit hurt. I thought I was trying to be supportive and helpful.

After reflecting on it, I decided to talk to Jenna about how her comment affected me. I explained that I was glad she found someone who worked for her but that her joke made me feel unappreciated for my efforts. Jenna apologized, admitting she didn’t think it would come off that way and that she valued my support. We had a productive conversation where I expressed my feelings, and she acknowledged that she could have chosen her words more carefully.

In the end, we both felt better after our talk, and I’m glad we could clear the air. But now I’m wondering if I overreacted to her comment. Was I the asshole for bringing it up?",771,2370,0.85,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_71040,2022-03-01 00:00:00,NAH,1955,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"About a month ago, my sister-in-law, ""Megan,"" invited my family over for dinner to celebrate her promotion at work. It was a big deal for her, and she wanted to gather everyone to share the joy. My brother, ""David,"" was excited too and wanted it to be a family affair.

On the day of the dinner, I was feeling under the weather with a mild cold. I debated whether to go, but ultimately I decided to attend because I didn’t want to disappoint Megan and ruin her celebration. I took precautions: I wore a mask and kept my distance as much as possible. I thought that being cautious would allow me to participate without risking anyone’s health.

During dinner, everything was fine at first. We were eating and laughing, and Megan was glowing with happiness. But as the evening went on, I started to feel worse. My throat was scratchy, and I could tell I was starting to cough. I tried to suppress it, but eventually I had to excuse myself to go to the bathroom.

While I was in the bathroom, I overheard some of my relatives talking. They were complaining about how I shouldn’t have come if I was feeling sick and that I was being irresponsible. It hurt to hear them say that, especially after trying so hard to be considerate. I knew they were worried about getting sick, and I understood their concerns, but at the same time, I felt like I had done my best to protect everyone.

I returned to the dining area, and when I sat down, I could see that the mood had shifted slightly. My brother, noticing that I looked a bit pale, asked if I was okay. I admitted that I wasn’t feeling great and might need to head home early. Megan, clearly a bit flustered, said she appreciated my efforts to be there but wished I had just let her know I wasn’t feeling well. 

Feeling cornered, I explained that I didn’t want to miss her special night, and I thought I could manage it. I could tell that the tension had risen, and I felt bad for causing any negative feelings during her celebration.

After a while, I said my goodbyes, and as I was leaving, I overheard some more comments about how I shouldn’t have come at all. It really hurt to feel like I had let them down, even though my intentions were good. 

Now, I’m left wondering if I was wrong to attend the dinner when I was feeling unwell, or if they were overreacting. I just wanted to support my sister-in-law in her moment of joy.

No one is the Asshole,"My sister and I have been planning a family reunion for months now. We both have different ideas about how we want it to go. I envisioned a fun, casual picnic in the park where everyone could relax and catch up. My sister, however, wanted a more structured affair with a catering service and formal seating.

We decided to compromise and organize a potluck-style picnic. I thought this was a fair solution, as it would allow everyone to bring their favorite dish and contribute to the gathering. I sent out the invitations and made sure to emphasize that it would be a laid-back event.

The day of the reunion arrived, and I made a big batch of my famous pasta salad and brought some games for the kids. When we got to the park, I was excited to see family, but my sister was already stressed out about the lack of a formal setup. She had gone ahead and set up a big table, hired a photographer, and arranged for someone to provide a cake.

As people started arriving, I noticed that my sister was upset about the informal nature of the picnic and commented on how it was ""not what she imagined."" I tried to reassure her, saying that everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, and it was nice to have a relaxed atmosphere. However, she continued to complain and seemed disappointed that things weren’t going according to her plan.

At one point, she snapped at me, saying I should have just followed her lead instead of trying to take over the planning. I felt hurt because I thought I was being collaborative. I told her that I appreciated her effort but that the potluck was meant to be a joint effort.

The reunion went well overall, with people eating, laughing, and enjoying the games, but there was definitely some tension between my sister and me. After the event, she texted me saying she felt like I undermined her vision.

Jake is a really nice guy overall, but he can be a bit controlling at times. For example, he always insists that Mia shares her location with him whenever she goes out with friends. He also has a habit of monitoring her social media accounts and gets upset if she posts pictures of herself that he doesn’t approve of. Mia brushes it off, saying he just cares about her and wants to keep her safe.

Recently, we had a family gathering, and during the dinner, Jake made a comment that I found to be quite inappropriate. He jokingly said that he expects Mia to quit her job once they’re married because she’ll have “more important things” to focus on, like being a wife. The room fell silent, and Mia laughed it off, but I could see she was uncomfortable. I decided to speak up and said, “That’s not really fair to her, Jake. She loves her job, and being a wife doesn’t mean she has to give up her career.”

Mia looked surprised and a bit angry at me for calling him out, and Jake seemed taken aback but didn’t argue. Afterward, Mia pulled me aside and told me I embarrassed her in front of everyone and that I should have kept my mouth shut. I explained that I was looking out for her and that I felt his comment was not okay.

No one is the Asshole,"I know this sounds bad, but just hear me out...

I've been living in my apartment for a few months now, and during that time, the neighbors above me have had some pretty loud parties. At first, I thought it was just a one-time thing, but it’s become a regular occurrence—almost every weekend. I usually work during the week and really value my downtime, so when Friday night rolls around, I look forward to some peace and quiet.

The noise often starts around 10 PM and goes on until the early hours of the morning. I’ve tried to be understanding because I know people want to have fun. I even gave them a friendly wave when I bumped into them in the hallway and smiled, hoping to create a good rapport. But it’s been hard to enjoy my weekends with the music blasting and people shouting.

After a particularly long week, last Saturday, I reached my breaking point. The noise was unbearable, and I was desperate for sleep. I decided to knock on their door at around 1 AM to ask them to keep it down. I approached it as kindly as I could, but when they opened the door, they were clearly in the middle of having a great time and didn’t take my request seriously. They laughed it off and even invited me in, which I politely declined.

I ended up leaving a note on their door the next day explaining how I felt about the noise and asking if they could try to keep it down on future weekends. I thought I was being reasonable and respectful. However, the response I got was mixed; some were apologetic, while others seemed annoyed that I’d complained.

Now I’m feeling conflicted. I don’t want to be the neighbor that ruins anyone’s fun, but I also feel like my request was fair. Am I the jerk for reaching out to them about the noise?

Edit: I did consider the fact that they might be celebrating something special, and I emphasized that I understand everyone deserves to unwind.

After discussing it with my partner, I suggested that my sister could stay, but I mentioned that we would need to set some ground rules to ensure everyone feels comfortable. I proposed that my sister contributes a small amount toward groceries and helps out with chores to create a shared living environment. My partner was worried about our privacy and the potential strain on our relationship, but he agreed to give it a try if my sister followed the rules.

I brought this plan up with my sister, and she was grateful but also expressed that she was feeling overwhelmed and anxious about her situation.

Growing up, he always leaned on me for support, especially after the passing of our parents when he was just 16. I took on a parental role, helping him with school, finances, and life decisions since I was already working full-time.

About a year ago, he started dating a girl, and things got serious pretty quickly. I was happy for him but a bit concerned because he seemed to be making decisions that weren't well thought out. He moved in with her after just a few months of dating, and while I respected his choices, I felt he was rushing into things. I expressed my concerns gently, not wanting to come off as too critical, but he took it poorly and accused me of trying to control his life.

Fast forward a few months, and he comes to me, clearly upset. He tells me that his girlfriend has been pressuring him to get a dog, which he feels unprepared for. I offered to help him think it through, but he insisted he wanted to go ahead with it anyway. After a long conversation, I suggested that perhaps it would be better to wait until they're more settled and can handle the responsibilities of a pet. He didn't take it well and said I was being dismissive of his feelings.

Eventually, he got the dog, and it was a disaster. He realized he couldn't manage the responsibility, especially since he was working long hours. He called me in tears, feeling overwhelmed and regretting the decision. I felt terrible for saying ""I told you so,"" but I had to gently remind him about our earlier conversations.

It was a rough patch for a while. I wanted to be supportive without being overbearing, but I couldn't help but feel frustrated that he didn’t listen to my advice. I ended up helping him find a temporary solution for the dog while he figured things out, but our relationship felt strained.

No one is the Asshole,"First time posting here, so please bear with me. 

I live in a small town where everyone knows each other, and recently, my best friend of ten years, Sarah, got engaged. I was thrilled for her and wanted to help with the wedding planning. Sarah has always been a bit of a control freak, so when she asked me for help, I thought it was a great opportunity to bond and support her.

As we started planning, I noticed Sarah was very particular about everything. At first, I tried to go with her ideas, but then I began to suggest some alternatives for the venue and decorations, which I thought could make the wedding even more special. However, she seemed to take my suggestions as criticism rather than helpful input. 

One day, during a planning session, I suggested a different color scheme that I thought would match her personality better. Instead of being open to it, she snapped at me, saying that I was trying to take over her wedding. I was taken aback and tried to apologize for overstepping, but it felt like the conversation just spiraled into a bigger argument. 

After that, I decided to take a step back and let her handle things her way. I thought maybe she just needed some space and time to realize that I genuinely wanted to help, not control. I felt really sad about the situation, as I care deeply for her and wanted to be involved.

I reached out to her a few days later, and we talked it out. She admitted that planning the wedding had become overwhelming for her, and she was stressed about making everyone happy. We both agreed to be open with each other and communicate better as the planning continued. 

In the end, we managed to find a balance that worked for both of us, and I’m excited to be part of her big day.

I suggested to Sarah that maybe we could take him to a quieter area for a little break. She was grateful for the idea and we took him to the backyard for some fresh air.

While we were outside, I noticed how much calmer he became. He started to play with some toys we brought and smiled more.

After a moment, I realized I might have pushed too far and quickly changed the subject to the other dishes I wanted to try.

Our building has a small communal courtyard, and we often take him there to play. There's a rule that says pets must be leashed in the courtyard, which we always follow. However, one day while we were out, another resident came by with their cat, who was not on a leash. The cat was roaming freely, and as it got closer to us, our dog got really excited and wanted to play.

I tried to explain that I wasn’t trying to dictate how they manage their pet, but I was genuinely concerned about the safety of both animals.

No one is the Asshole,"I (30F) live with my partner (32M), and we both have busy schedules. Lately, we've been juggling our jobs and personal commitments, which has left us both feeling a bit stretched. I work as a project manager and often have to bring work home, while he works as a freelance graphic designer, so his hours can vary greatly.

Recently, we decided to have a movie night at home. I was really looking forward to it, but the week leading up to it was particularly hectic for both of us. The day of our planned movie night, I got caught up in a last-minute project deadline, and by the time I was finished, I was completely drained. I really didn’t have the energy to cook a full meal, so I suggested we order takeout instead.

When I brought it up, my partner seemed a bit disappointed. He mentioned that he had been looking forward to making a homemade pizza together for the night. I felt terrible because I knew he had planned it all week, but I was genuinely exhausted and didn’t want to ruin the evening by forcing myself to cook.

I suggested that we could save the pizza-making for another night when we both had more energy, and we could enjoy the movie with takeout instead. He was quiet for a moment and then agreed, but I could see he wasn't really thrilled about it. We ended up ordering food, and I tried to make the most of the night, but I could tell he was a bit off.

After the movie, he opened up about how he felt let down because he had been looking forward to making the pizza together. I understood his perspective, but I explained that I genuinely couldn’t have managed cooking that night. We both apologized to each other for not communicating better about our expectations and I reassured him that I wanted to make the pizza together soon.

No one is the Asshole,"I’m currently in my last year of college, and it’s been really tough. I’ve been juggling my studies along with a part-time job to support myself, but it hasn’t been easy. My parents are supportive but have limited financial means, so I’ve been trying to do everything on my own.

Recently, I found out that my job hours are being cut significantly due to budget constraints. This means I won’t be able to afford rent next semester. I’ve been stressed out about what to do, as I really want to finish my degree.

A few weeks ago, I confided in my friend about my situation. She offered to let me stay at her house rent-free for the remainder of the year. Her family is supportive and has the space, and they’ve assured me that they wouldn’t mind having me around. I really appreciate her offer, but I’m worried that I might be taking advantage of her kindness. 

I’ve always prided myself on being independent, and accepting help feels like I’m relying on others too much. I don’t want to strain our friendship or feel like a burden. At the same time, I know that moving in with her would allow me to focus on my studies without the overwhelming stress of financial issues.

I’ve been going back and forth on whether I should accept her offer.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently got into a debate with my sibling during a family dinner about an environmental issue. Our parents have always been very environmentally conscious, and growing up, we were taught the importance of sustainability. I’ve taken that to heart and try to live a zero-waste lifestyle. My sibling, on the other hand, tends to be more laid-back about these things and doesn’t feel as strongly about it.

During dinner, we started discussing single-use plastics, and I shared how I've begun using reusable bags and containers. I was excited and wanted to encourage my sibling to consider making some changes too. However, my sibling dismissed my suggestions and said it was ""just not practical"" for their lifestyle. I felt a bit hurt because it sounded like they were invalidating my efforts and beliefs.

In my frustration, I pointed out that making small changes can make a difference, and I urged them to think about it. This led to a back-and-forth where my sibling called me ""holier-than-thou"" and accused me of trying to make them feel guilty for not caring as much. I didn’t mean to come off that way—I just wanted to share something I believed in passionately.

Eventually, things cooled down, and we shifted the topic, but I’ve been reflecting on the conversation. I think both of us were just coming from different perspectives without really understanding each other. I can see how my enthusiasm might have felt overwhelming to them, but I also felt hurt by their dismissal of something I care deeply about. 

So, am I the asshole for trying to share my passion for environmentalism, or is my sibling wrong for shutting down the conversation?

No one is the Asshole,"So, my partner and I recently had a bit of a disagreement over how to handle a family gathering. We both come from different backgrounds and have different ways of celebrating holidays. 

For my family, Thanksgiving is a big deal with everyone gathering at my parents' house for a huge feast. We usually cook everything from scratch and spend the day together, which is something I cherish. On the other hand, my partner's family has a more laid-back approach, often opting for takeout and a smaller, more intimate setting.

This year, we decided to host Thanksgiving at our place, wanting to blend our traditions. I was excited to prepare a big meal and have our families come together. However, my partner suggested we order food from a local restaurant instead, arguing that it would reduce stress and allow us to enjoy the gathering more. I was initially frustrated, feeling like it would take away from the experience of cooking together and sharing family recipes.

After some back-and-forth, we both realized we had valid points. I wanted to preserve the tradition of cooking a big meal, while my partner wanted to ease the pressure and enjoy the day without feeling overwhelmed. In the end, we came up with a compromise: we would cook the turkey and a few traditional dishes together, but also order some sides and desserts from the restaurant. 

We both felt satisfied with this solution, and our families had a great time. It made me realize that sometimes blending different traditions can lead to a more enjoyable experience for everyone involved.

No one is the Asshole,"So my partner and I have been planning a weekend getaway for months. We booked a cozy cabin in the mountains, and it's something we've both really been looking forward to. We've been under a lot of stress lately, and we thought this would be a perfect way to unwind together.

A week before the trip, my sister called me in tears. She just found out that her boyfriend of three years cheated on her, and she was heartbroken. I felt terrible for her and wanted to be supportive, so I invited her to join us at the cabin. I figured it would be nice for her to get away and have some time to process everything in a more relaxed environment.

I told my partner about the idea, and he was a bit hesitant. He wanted the trip to be just the two of us since we rarely get quality time together. I understood his perspective but was also worried about my sister. After discussing it more, we compromised: my sister could join us for the first night, and then she would leave the next morning so we could have our time alone.

When my sister arrived, she seemed to appreciate the change of scenery, and we spent the evening talking and trying to cheer her up. However, the next morning, my partner woke up upset. He felt like he didn’t get any alone time with me and was frustrated that I hadn’t thought about how he would feel about my sister being there at all.

I apologized for not considering his feelings more and explained that I just wanted to be there for my sister in a time of need. He admitted he could have communicated his feelings better instead of just bottling it up. We ended up having a long conversation about how we can support each other while also being there for family.

In the end, my sister left as planned, and my partner and I enjoyed the rest of the weekend together. We both learned how to communicate better and support each other’s needs.

My cousin and I had a falling out a couple of years ago over some family drama, and we haven’t really spoken since. I’ve been dreading the idea of being in the same room with them for a whole day, and I’m not sure if it would be awkward or if it might escalate into something more.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently started volunteering at a local community center that offers support for at-risk youth. There’s a teenager, Sam, who has been coming to the center regularly. He often seems withdrawn and struggles to engage with others. 

One day, while we were working on a group project, I noticed he was unusually quiet and not contributing. I tried to encourage him to share his thoughts, but he just shrugged it off. After the session, I pulled him aside and gently asked if everything was okay. He opened up about feeling overwhelmed with school, family issues, and his mental health. 

I wanted to help him, so I suggested that he talk to the center’s counselor who could provide more tailored support. However, I also understood that it’s not easy for someone to open up about these things, especially if they’re not ready. I offered to stay with him and even accompany him to talk to the counselor if that would make it less intimidating.

Sam appreciated the offer but ultimately decided he wasn’t ready to take that step yet. I respected his feelings and didn’t push him further, letting him know I was there for him whenever he needed someone to talk to. 

I felt like I was trying to do the right thing by being supportive, but I also worried that I wasn’t doing enough. I later talked to the other volunteers about what I could do to better help the kids without overstepping their boundaries. They reassured me that just being there and listening was valuable in itself, and we all agreed that we need to approach each youth with understanding and patience. 

I still think about Sam often and hope he finds the courage to reach out when he’s ready, but I also know I can’t force him to do so.

No one is the Asshole,"This happened a few months ago, and it's been on my mind since then. I’m hoping to get some perspective on it.

So, my friend Lisa (27) and I (26) have been close for years. We get along well, and I really care about her. However, she tends to have a laid-back attitude towards cleanliness, which became more apparent when she moved in with her boyfriend, Mark (30). Their apartment is often cluttered, with dishes piling up and laundry left on the floor. I wouldn’t say it’s dirty, just very disorganized, and it sometimes makes it hard for me to relax when I visit.

One weekend, I invited Lisa and Mark over for dinner and game night. When they arrived, I noticed that Mark seemed a bit off. He looked stressed, and I later found out it was because he had been feeling overwhelmed with work and managing the household. I could tell that Lisa wasn’t too concerned about the state of their place, and that made me worry for Mark.

After dinner, while we were playing games, I casually mentioned that I’d be happy to help them organize their apartment if they ever needed it. I thought it might ease some of Mark’s stress, but Lisa brushed it off, laughing and saying it was just their “creative chaos.” Mark didn’t say much but looked a bit uncomfortable.

Later that night, I had a thought. I knew Lisa had plans to visit her family the following weekend, so I texted Mark and offered to come by and help him declutter while she was away. I figured it would be a nice surprise for Lisa when she got back. He was hesitant at first but eventually agreed, saying he could use the help.

The next day, I showed up at their apartment with some trash bags and a positive attitude. I started in the living room, putting things in order and tossing out expired food from the fridge. I worked for about five hours, and by the time I was done, the place looked so much better. Mark was thrilled and thanked me profusely, saying it felt like a weight had been lifted off his shoulders.

When Lisa returned, she was shocked. At first, she was grateful, but then she started to get upset. She felt I had overstepped by cleaning without asking her. We had a long conversation where I explained my intentions were good, and I just wanted to help Mark out. She acknowledged that I didn’t do anything malicious, but she felt like I undermined her ability to keep their space how she wanted. 

It’s been a bit awkward since then, and Mark has tried to smooth things over, but Lisa still brings it up sometimes. I didn’t mean to cause tension between them, and I genuinely thought I was helping.

So, am I the asshole for cleaning while Lisa was away without her permission? I thought I was being helpful, but I can see how it might have seemed disrespectful to her.",771,1048,0.65,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_86300,2020-11-16 00:00:00,NAH,2749,AITA

I have a friend, let’s call him Jake. We’ve been buddies since high school, and we’ve always supported each other through ups and downs. Recently, Jake has been going through a rough patch in his life. He lost his job a few months ago and has been struggling to find a new one. He’s also been feeling pretty down about it, which is understandable. 

What’s been tough is that Jake tends to vent about his problems a lot, which I totally get—everyone needs to let off steam. However, it feels like every time we hang out, the conversation revolves around his job search, how hopeless he feels, and how he thinks he’ll never find another job. I’ve tried to be supportive, encouraging him with positive thoughts and suggesting he try different job search strategies or even consider new career paths.

Despite my efforts, it seems like he’s stuck in this negative loop, and while I want to be there for him, I find myself getting a little drained by the constant focus on his struggles. I’ve tried to change the subject to lighter topics or share some of my own experiences, but he always circles back to his job woes. 

Recently, I realized that I need to take a step back for my own mental health. I still care about him and want to be supportive, but the frequency of our hangouts has started to feel like a chore instead of a joy. I did talk to him and suggested we take a break from our regular hangouts for a bit and maybe catch up less frequently. I explained that I felt overwhelmed and needed some space, but I assured him that I’m still here for him if he needs anything.

I really hope this doesn’t hurt our friendship, but I feel like it’s necessary for both of us right now. I don’t blame him for his feelings, and I understand why he’s struggling, but I also think it’s important to take care of my own mental well-being.

Sam had a younger sister, Lily, who was about five years younger than us. She was a sweet kid, but a bit clingy; she always wanted to hang out with us even though we were in high school and she was just a little middle schooler.

One summer, Sam and I decided to go on a road trip to the beach. We’d been looking forward to this trip for months, just the two of us, to relax and enjoy time together. A few days before we were set to leave, Sam’s parents asked if Lily could join us. They thought it would be a good bonding experience and that it would be nice for her to spend time with us. Sam was hesitant but eventually agreed, so I went along with it.

The trip was a challenge. Lily was excited and wanted to do everything we did, which meant I had to adjust my plans. While Sam and I wanted to hang out and relax, Lily wanted to go to the arcade, do kid-friendly activities, and was constantly interrupting our conversations. I tried my best to include her, but it was tough. By the end of the trip, I felt like I had missed out on the time I had planned with my best friend.

When we got back, I expressed my frustration to Sam. I told him I felt like I didn’t get to have the experience we had planned, and I was a bit annoyed that we couldn’t enjoy our time together without interruptions from Lily. Sam understood my feelings but also pointed out that it wasn't fair to blame Lily for wanting to spend time with us. He said she looked up to us and just wanted to be included.

One day, Mia invited a few close friends over for a small gathering to remember her mom. She wanted to share stories and celebrate her life. I thought it was a lovely idea and was glad to help her with the planning. As we prepared, I noticed that Mia was very much focused on creating a space that mirrored her mother’s favorite things. She had set up pictures of her mom around the living room, and it was clear that this meant a lot to her.

During the gathering, I could see that Mia was overwhelmed by the emotions in the room, which was completely understandable. At one point, while we were reminiscing, a friend suggested we take a group photo to capture the moment. Mia hesitated and then said she didn’t want to take a picture with her mom’s photos in the background because it felt too heavy for her. I thought I understood her feelings, so I suggested we move to another room that was more neutral, so we could take the photo without her mom’s presence looming over us.

Mia teared up and said that she actually wanted her mom in the background because it was a way to include her in the moment. I felt awful and quickly backtracked, apologizing for suggesting something that upset her.

During the night, we ended up sitting next to each other. I decided to strike up a conversation with him, trying to make him feel included. We talked about various topics, but it was clear he was quite reserved. I thought it would be helpful to introduce him to others, so I brought him over to a small group where I knew he might find common interests.

As the conversation continued, I realized that Jake was somewhat socially awkward and struggled with eye contact. I tried my best to encourage him and make him feel welcome, but as the night wore on, I noticed that he was still not fully engaging.

I felt embarrassed for him, but instead of calling him out or making him feel worse, I tried to change the subject and lighten the mood.

No one is the Asshole,"So, a few months ago, my partner and I attended a family reunion on my side of the family. My relatives are quite close-knit, and they usually engage in a lot of group activities and games. I was really looking forward to it, especially since my partner hadn't met most of my family before.

As the day went on, it became clear that my family had a strong tradition of playing board games together. Everyone was excited and gathered around the game table. My partner, however, is not a fan of board games and tends to feel overwhelmed in large group settings. I asked if they wanted to join in, but they politely declined, saying they would rather sit and chat with my grandmother, who wasn't into games either.

I thought that was totally fine, so I went to join the game. My family was enthusiastic, and we ended up playing for a couple of hours. During this time, I noticed my partner sitting quietly with my grandmother, and I felt a pang of guilt for not being with them. After the game, I went over to check in and see how they were doing. My partner seemed a bit down, and I asked if they were okay. They mentioned feeling a bit left out and that they wished I had spent more time with them.

I understood where they were coming from, but I also thought it was important to engage with my family. I explained that I was just trying to balance both sides. My partner appreciated my perspective but expressed that they felt slightly neglected during the reunion.

After we got home, we had a calm discussion about it. I acknowledged their feelings and promised to make more of an effort to include them in my family's activities next time. They also realized how important it was for me to connect with my family during these gatherings.

So, AITA for spending time with my family at the reunion instead of sticking with my partner? 

EDIT: Thanks for all the feedback! I've communicated more openly with my partner about balancing our needs during family events, and we're both committed to making it work better in the future.",323,2765,0.97,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_37839,2024-02-08 00:00:00,NAH,2033,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"A few weeks ago, I was invited to my friend’s wedding. She’s been planning this day for over a year, and I was really excited to celebrate with her. As the wedding approached, I realized that I didn’t have anything to wear. I wanted to look nice and feel good, but my budget was tight.

I reached out to a few friends to see if they had any dresses I could borrow, and thankfully, one of my friends offered to lend me a beautiful dress that she had worn to a previous wedding. I was really grateful and went to try it on. It fit perfectly, and I felt confident wearing it.

On the day of the wedding, I arrived early to help with setup. As I was chatting with the bride, I noticed that she seemed a bit stressed. She mentioned that she had lost a few items that were supposed to be part of the decor. I offered to help her search for them, and while we were looking, I found one of the missing pieces hidden away in a corner of the venue.

The bride was so relieved and grateful for my help. Later in the evening, during her speech, she mentioned how thankful she was for friends who stepped up when things got tough. I felt really proud to be there for her.

However, after the wedding, I learned that some guests had noticed my borrowed dress and thought it was actually the bride’s dress from her first wedding (she had been married before). I felt a bit uncomfortable, and I worried that I might have unintentionally overshadowed her special day.

I spoke to the bride about it afterward, and she assured me that she loved having me there and that she didn’t mind at all. Still, I felt conflicted. I truly wanted to support my friend and celebrate her happiness, but I didn’t want to add any unnecessary stress.

So, was I wrong for borrowing the dress and possibly causing confusion at the wedding? I really appreciated my friend’s generosity, and I had the best intentions, but I still worry if I might have crossed a line. AITA for borrowing a dress and wearing it to my friend’s wedding?",352,2326,0.65,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_68976,2020-05-10 00:00:00,NAH,1995,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I'm a 30-year-old graphic designer, and I've been working in the industry for about eight years now. Recently, I’ve started to gain some recognition for my work, and I’m feeling pretty optimistic about my career. I love collaborating with others and I believe that everyone has something valuable to contribute creatively, regardless of their experience level.

I have a close friend, Sam, who is a talented painter but has struggled to find his footing in the art world. He often expresses his frustration with the industry, and I try to encourage him to keep pursuing his passion. We often share our work with each other, and I’ve always appreciated his feedback on my designs.

A few weeks ago, Sam approached me with the idea of creating a joint art project. He wanted to combine my graphic design skills with his painting to produce a series of pieces for a local gallery. I loved the idea and thought it could be a great opportunity for both of us. However, as we began to brainstorm, I noticed that Sam was getting a bit erratic with his ideas. He began suggesting concepts that were, frankly, a bit out there—like using unconventional materials or pursuing a theme that felt disjointed from our original vision.

I gently tried to steer him towards a more cohesive direction, explaining that while I appreciate his creativity, we needed to ensure that our project would resonate with the gallery’s audience. I suggested we focus on a more unified theme and maybe refine some of the ideas to better suit our strengths. Sam took this quite personally and accused me of stifling his creativity. He said I was being overly critical and not supportive, which hurt because I genuinely just wanted to create something great together.

After some back and forth, we managed to find a compromise, but it left both of us feeling a bit frustrated. I understand where he’s coming from, but I also think it’s important to balance creativity with practical considerations, especially when you’re trying to present work publicly.

No one is the Asshole,"I know the title sounds bad, but please hear me out.

So, I (24F) have a close friend, Sarah (25F), who has been like a sister to me since we were kids. We've always supported each other through thick and thin. However, Sarah has been struggling with her mental health for a while now. She’s been in and out of therapy and has recently been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. 

I’ve tried to be there for her as much as possible, but I also have my own life to manage. I recently started a new job, and I’ve been putting in a lot of effort to succeed. I also met someone special, Jake (26M), and we’ve been dating for a few months. Sarah was happy for me at first, but I noticed that she started pulling away. 

One day, she called me and opened up about feeling really overwhelmed and isolated. She said she felt like I was moving on with my life while she was stuck, and it made her feel abandoned. I tried to reassure her that I care deeply for her and that I’m still here for her, but it seemed like nothing I said helped.

The conversation escalated when she expressed that she was upset I hadn’t invited her to meet Jake yet. I explained that it was still early in the relationship and I wanted to take things slow. In the heat of the moment, I said something I now regret: “I can’t put my life on hold just because you’re struggling.” 

After I hung up, I felt terrible about it. I didn’t mean to dismiss her feelings; I just felt frustrated because I was trying to balance everything. I reached out the next day to apologize and explain that I didn’t mean it that way, but she was still hurt. 

Things have been tense between us ever since. I want to support her while also living my life, and I’m struggling to find that balance. Our mutual friends seem divided on who's in the wrong, and I just want to know if I crossed a line. 

So, am I the asshole for prioritizing my life while my friend is struggling? I genuinely care about her and want to help, but I also need to take care of myself.",156,2798,0.68,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_48873,2023-07-08 00:00:00,NAH,2006,AITA

A few weeks ago, my parents suggested that we all have a family game night to spend some quality time together. I thought it was a nice idea, so I helped set everything up and even brought out some snacks. However, as soon as we started playing, my brother began to dominate the game, making it less fun for everyone. He was really competitive and kept mocking our mistakes.

After a couple of rounds, I was feeling frustrated and decided to step outside for some fresh air. I could hear my parents talking to my brother about how they felt he was being a bit too intense and that it was ruining the fun. When I came back inside, I could see he was annoyed. He made a sarcastic comment about how I was just going to run away whenever things got tough.

I tried to explain that I just needed a break, but he kept pushing, saying that I was just being overly sensitive. I snapped back that he needed to chill out and stop making the game not enjoyable for everyone. It turned into a bit of an argument, and my parents ended up having to intervene.

Afterward, my brother accused me of ruining the game night by making a big deal out of nothing. I felt bad about the whole situation, but I also think he should have recognized that his behavior was affecting the atmosphere. My parents just wanted us to bond, and I don’t think either of us handled the situation perfectly.

Now, I’m wondering if I overreacted or if my brother was being unreasonable. I feel guilty for causing tension in the family, but I also think it’s important to stand up for myself. So, am I the asshole here?",710,2166,0.67,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_54089,2021-12-25 00:00:00,NAH,1851,AITA

This year, I was really excited because I found a new spot that I thought would be perfect, and I made all the arrangements for the campsite. 

A week before our trip, my friend called me to tell me that her brother had just been in a car accident.

No one is the Asshole,"I’ve been planning my wedding for quite some time now, and everything has been going relatively smoothly. I have a close-knit group of friends, and I love them all dearly. I decided to have a small wedding with just family and my closest friends, which is about 30 people total.

A few weeks ago, I was talking with my best friend, Sarah, who has been super supportive throughout the planning process. She mentioned that she wanted to bring her boyfriend, who I’ve only met a couple of times. I told her that I was trying to keep the guest list small, and while I didn’t want to exclude her, I really needed to stick to my numbers. She seemed to understand and said she would come solo.

Fast forward to last weekend, I had a get-together where I introduced my fiancé to some friends. Sarah showed up with her boyfriend, and I was taken aback. I didn’t say anything at the time, but later I pulled her aside and asked why she brought him without checking with me first. She explained that they were in a serious relationship, and she thought it would be nice for him to be there.

I calmly told her that I appreciated her wanting him there, but I really wanted to keep it intimate. I didn't want to make her feel bad, but I felt like she disregarded my wishes. She got a bit defensive and said it was unfair for me to expect her to make a choice between her boyfriend and a friend, especially since they are serious. We ended up having a frank discussion, and I let her know that I value our friendship and didn’t want to hurt her feelings.

After our talk, things seem to have settled down, and she's still excited about the wedding, but I’m left wondering if I overstepped by asking her to come alone or if I was justified in wanting her to respect my wishes for a small wedding.

So, a few weeks ago, my best friend (let's call her Sarah, 16) and I were chatting about fashion and our personal styles. Sarah mentioned she really wanted to dye her hair bright blue. I thought it would look amazing on her, but I also warned her that it might be a bit of a challenge to maintain, especially since she has a part-time job where they have a strict dress code.

After some back and forth, she decided to go for it, and I supported her choice wholeheartedly. The day she dyed her hair, I was super excited and helped her style it. She looked incredible! However, a few days later, she received a warning from her manager about her hair color not complying with the dress code. She was really upset and started to question whether she should have done it.

I tried to empathize with her feelings, but I also felt it was important to remind her of the risks that come with such a drastic change, especially with her job. We ended up having a bit of a heated discussion where I suggested she might want to consider temporary colors or even wearing a hat for work until she could find a way to navigate the situation. She felt like I was blaming her for the decision and it led to her saying I wasn’t being a good friend.

I genuinely thought I was just trying to help her think through the consequences of her choice, but now I’m feeling guilty about our argument.

Some background info: I (F28) have a younger brother (M24) who has always been a bit of a free spirit. He dropped out of college to pursue his passion for music, which was a huge departure from our family's more traditional values. Our parents have always been supportive but also worry about his future since the music industry can be quite unstable.

Recently, my brother invited me to one of his gigs at a local bar. I was excited to see him perform and show my support.

After the show, I told my brother how proud I was of him for pursuing his passion but expressed my concern about the message of some of the songs. I mentioned that I thought he could potentially alienate some audience members and that maybe he should consider diversifying his repertoire a bit. He seemed taken aback and said that this was his art and that I should respect his creative freedom.

I decided to reply politely, explaining that I had a busy week and that I had done my share of cleaning in other areas. I suggested that maybe we could rotate taking out the trash on specific days to make it fair. Sarah responded that she appreciated my effort but still felt overwhelmed with her own schedule and needed me to step up more often.

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I recently decided to take a family trip with our two kids, Alex and Jamie, who are both 12. We wanted to make this trip special and memorable, so we planned a fun-filled week at a theme park.

To get our kids excited and involved, we told them they could each choose one special activity or experience during the trip, and we would budget accordingly for it. This way, they could prioritize what they really wanted to do and feel a sense of ownership over the trip.

Alex immediately knew he wanted to try out the extreme roller coaster that he had heard so much about. Jamie, on the other hand, was really interested in the character dining experience where they could meet their favorite characters from movies and enjoy a special meal.

We set aside $150 for each kid’s special activity, which would cover tickets and any extras. When we arrived at the park, we had a blast exploring the rides and attractions together. However, I noticed that Jamie’s character dining experience took a big chunk of the budget.

Later that evening, we had a family discussion about it. I explained that both activities were valuable, and we did our best to budget for them equally, but that Jamie's choice was just more expensive. Alex, being the considerate brother, offered to share some of his leftover money for Jamie to get a small souvenir.

The next day, Jamie appreciated Alex’s generosity but felt guilty about taking his money. Ultimately, we decided to compromise by splitting the costs of a souvenir between them. I felt proud of both kids for working it out together.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I recently moved back in with my parents for a few months while I save up for a new place. I’m in my late 20s and have always had a good relationship with them. They live in a cozy townhouse, which I’ve always loved, but it has its quirks.

When I moved in, I was really excited to spend some quality time with them. They’re both retired now, and I thought it would be great to reconnect. However, I've quickly realized that they have pretty different schedules than I do. While I'm still working full-time, my parents seem to be on a totally different clock. They stay up late, often watching loud movies or having friends over, and they’re generally a bit noisier than I remembered.

I typically get up early for work, and I’ve been struggling to get enough sleep because of all the noise. I tried using white noise machines and earplugs, but nothing seems to help. I feel bad because I know they’re just enjoying their time together—it’s nice to see them so happy—but I’m really exhausted.

Last week, I finally decided I needed to say something. I sat them down and explained how I was feeling, trying to be as respectful as possible. I told them I appreciated everything they’re doing for me, but I really needed to get better sleep to perform well at work.

To my surprise, they were really understanding. They apologized and said they hadn’t realized how loud they were being. They promised to keep the noise down during the week and to be more mindful of my schedule. We even came up with a compromise where they’d have movie nights on weekends instead of weekdays.

I’m so relieved that we could have an open conversation and that they were receptive. I genuinely feel like we’re all on the same team and that it’s okay to express when something is bothering me. So, I’m just wondering if I handled the situation well or if there was a better way to approach it.",5,707,0.95,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_33853,2020-09-22 00:00:00,NAH,1875,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"This happened last month.

I have a close group of friends, and we often get together for game nights. We all enjoy a good laugh, but one of our friends, Jake, has been going through a tough time lately. He's been dealing with some personal issues, and while we all try to support him, he's been more sensitive than usual.

During our last game night, we decided to play a game that involves some light roasting and jokes. Everyone was having a great time, and the atmosphere was really positive. However, when it was Jake's turn, I made a joke that I thought was harmless, but it touched on one of the things he's been struggling with. I didn’t realize it until I saw his face drop and he went quiet.

Immediately, I felt terrible and tried to apologize, but Jake just needed some space and left the room. The mood shifted, and everyone started to feel awkward. A couple of my friends were upset with me for making the joke, while others were trying to lighten the mood again. We ended up wrapping up the night early because Jake didn’t come back.

The next day, I reached out to Jake to apologize again and let him know that I didn’t mean to hurt him. He appreciated the message and said he understood that I didn’t have bad intentions, but he needed some time to process things. We’re still friends, but I can’t help but feel guilty for ruining the night and potentially making things harder for him.

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been living together for a couple of years, and we recently decided to adopt a dog. We both love animals and have been looking forward to having a furry friend in our home. After researching and visiting shelters, we found a lovely three-year-old rescue dog that we both fell in love with and decided to adopt.

Before bringing the dog home, we had several discussions about responsibilities. My partner expressed that they would like to take on the majority of the dog’s training since they have some experience working with dogs in the past. I was supportive of this but mentioned that I wanted to be involved in the training process as well, especially since I would also be caring for the dog. We agreed that we would work together to ensure the dog felt comfortable and loved.

Once the dog came home, my partner started training sessions immediately and seemed to be enjoying it. However, I noticed that they often used a stern tone when correcting the dog’s behavior, which sometimes made the dog appear anxious. I approached my partner about it, expressing my concern and suggesting we try to use more positive reinforcement methods instead. I wanted to ensure the dog felt secure and understood what we wanted from them without feeling scared.

My partner got defensive, insisting that their methods were effective and that the dog was responding well to the training. I tried to communicate that I believed a gentler approach might work better for a rescue dog, who likely needed a little more patience and understanding. We ended up having a heated discussion about our different training philosophies, and it escalated into a disagreement where both of us felt misunderstood.

After cooling off, we both realized that we had valid concerns and intentions. My partner wanted to ensure the dog learned quickly and effectively, while I wanted to build a trusting relationship with the dog. We decided that it was important to compromise and blend our training styles, agreeing to attend a training class together where we could learn from a professional.

In the end, we both care deeply about the dog and want what’s best for them. We may not have agreed at first, but we found a solution that works for both of us. So, am I the asshole for questioning my partner’s training methods, or were we just trying to do our best for our new pet?",603,2866,0.86,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_47397,2023-11-11 00:00:00,NAH,2370,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Background: I have a close-knit group of friends that meets regularly for game nights. We usually play board games, card games, and occasionally, video games. Everyone in our group is pretty laid-back and we always prioritize having fun together over competition. 

Last week, we planned a game night at my place, and I decided to introduce a new game that I had recently bought. It’s a cooperative game that requires teamwork, and I thought it would be a great way for us to bond. Everyone seemed excited when I explained the rules, and we dove right in.

About halfway through the game, one of my friends, Alex, started to become frustrated. It turned out that they felt like the rest of us were not listening to their suggestions and were making decisions without considering their input. I noticed this too, and while I thought we were all having fun, I could see that Alex’s mood was dipping. 

In an attempt to lighten the mood, I jokingly said, “Come on, Alex! Don’t be a downer! We’re supposed to be having fun!” This comment didn’t land well. Instead of laughing, Alex looked hurt and upset, and the tension in the room escalated. The game came to a halt as everyone sensed the discomfort.

Realizing my mistake, I quickly apologized to Alex, acknowledging that I hadn’t meant to belittle their feelings. I explained that I thought we were all having a good time and didn’t realize they were feeling left out. The group helped diffuse the situation by suggesting we take a break and grab some snacks.

After a few minutes, we all sat down together, and Alex expressed how they felt ignored during the game. We listened, and the rest of us shared our thoughts as well. It ended up being a constructive conversation where we all learned how to communicate better during our game nights. 

I felt terrible about my joke and didn’t want to cause any rifts, but I also believe that it led to a necessary discussion about group dynamics.

No one is the Asshole,"I (F22) have a small group of friends that I’ve known since high school, and we often get together for game nights. Recently, we decided to host a themed game night at my apartment, and I was really excited about it. I spent a lot of time preparing, from buying snacks to setting up decorations that matched the theme.

A few days before our game night, I invited a new friend, Alex (M23), to join us. He’s a great person and has been looking to make new friends since moving to our city. However, I didn’t realize that he had been struggling with social anxiety and wasn’t sure how he would handle a larger group setting.

On the night of the game, my close friends arrived, and I introduced everyone to Alex. He seemed a little nervous, but I thought he would warm up as the night went on. We started playing a party game that involved a lot of laughter and interaction, and while my friends were engaged, I noticed that Alex was sitting a bit apart, mostly quiet.

I tried to include him by asking for his input during the game and encouraging him to participate, but I could tell he was still feeling overwhelmed. At one point, Alex excused himself and went to the bathroom, and when he returned, he said he needed to leave early because he was feeling anxious.

I felt bad because I wanted him to have a good time, but I also understood that sometimes social situations can be too much. I walked him to the door and told him it was totally okay to leave if he was feeling uncomfortable. He thanked me for understanding and left. 

After he left, I spoke with my friends about how I hoped he felt welcome and included. Some of them mentioned that they thought it was too loud and chaotic for someone who wasn’t used to larger groups. They empathized with Alex’s situation but also pointed out that we might have inadvertently made it harder for him to feel comfortable.

I’ve been reflecting on it since then and wonder if there was more I could have done to help Alex feel included without overwhelming him. I don’t think anyone was in the wrong here, but I still feel a bit guilty about how things turned out.

No one is the Asshole,"So here’s the situation: my brother and I have always had different tastes in food. I love spicy food and he can’t handle anything hotter than mild salsa. Whenever we have family dinners, it often turns into a debate about what to cook because I want to try new, spicy recipes, while he prefers simple, bland dishes.

To avoid constant arguments, we came up with a compromise: we would take turns choosing the meal for family gatherings. One week it would be my turn to make something spicy, and the next week it would be his turn to make something milder.

This worked well for a while, but the last time it was my turn, I decided to make a spicy curry that I was really excited about. I made sure to have some cooling yogurt on the side and a mild version for anyone who couldn't handle the heat. However, when my brother arrived, he immediately complained about the smell and insisted that I should have made something he could eat without worrying about it being too spicy.

I felt a bit frustrated because I had followed our agreement and tried to accommodate him by having a milder option available. I explained this to him, but he still seemed upset and said that I should have known better than to make something so spicy in the first place.

I genuinely want us both to enjoy our time together, but I also love trying new flavors. It feels like a balancing act, and I’m unsure if I overstepped by sticking to the agreement.

However, he has been super stressed out about making the team for the upcoming school year. He's been talking about it nonstop and sometimes gets really frustrated when things don’t go his way.

A few days ago, we were hanging out at my place, playing video games and just having a good time. At one point, he paused the game and started talking about how worried he was about trying out for the team. I tried to be supportive, but I also wanted to lighten the mood a bit. So, I jokingly said, “Dude, if you keep practicing as hard as you are, you’ll either end up as the star player or you’ll be sitting on the bench eating chips!” 

He laughed at first, but then he suddenly got serious and said, “That’s not funny. You don’t understand how much this means to me.” I felt bad because I didn’t mean to upset him. I tried to explain that I was just joking and I really do support him, but he just shrugged it off and changed the subject.

Later, he told me that I was being insensitive and that I shouldn’t joke about something so important to him. I didn’t think I was being a jerk; I just wanted to make him smile. I talked to some mutual friends about it, and they said I was just trying to be funny and that it was a misunderstanding.

Now, I’m left wondering if I crossed a line. I didn’t mean to hurt his feelings, and I really do care about his goals. I guess I just wanted to take some of the pressure off.

Last Sunday, I had a long week at work and felt really drained. I woke up late, and when I finally got out of bed, I found that my partner had already started cleaning without me. They had taken it upon themselves to do the whole living room, which was fine, but it wasn’t the plan we had discussed. I felt a bit left out and like my contribution wasn’t valued, especially since I'd planned to help out.

When I expressed my feelings, my partner got defensive and said they just wanted to make sure we kept our home tidy. They mentioned feeling overwhelmed too and thought it would be easier to just tackle things without waiting for me. I understand where they were coming from, but I also felt hurt that they didn’t communicate with me about it.

After a bit of back and forth, we both apologized for the misunderstanding. I acknowledged that I should have communicated my feelings sooner instead of letting them fester, and they agreed that it would be better to stick to our original plan in the future.

I have a daughter (8) from a previous relationship, and my partner has a son (10). We’ve always tried to create a harmonious environment for our kids, and we share a lot of responsibilities, including finances and household chores.

Recently, we decided to plan a family vacation, and I was really excited about it. I wanted to make it special for the kids, so I proposed a trip to a theme park that both of them love. I even saved some money and offered to cover most of the costs, including tickets and accommodations, with the understanding that my partner would handle food and activities.

When I brought up the idea, my partner seemed hesitant. She expressed concerns about the costs, saying she wasn’t sure if she could afford to contribute enough and wanted to make sure it was fair to both kids, especially since my daughter has a more privileged background. I assured her that I wanted to treat both kids equally and that my offer wasn’t intended to create any imbalance or favoritism.

After discussing it further, my partner suggested that we should wait until we could save more money to ensure that we could do a bigger trip that included all of our favorite activities without financial stress. I understood her point but felt disappointed because I had already envisioned this trip and didn’t want to wait.

In the end, we compromised by agreeing on a shorter trip to a nearby location that was more affordable. I thought this was a good solution, and both kids seemed excited about it. However, I still felt a bit frustrated about my initial offer being dismissed.

I later expressed this to my partner, and she apologized for not recognizing my intentions earlier. She explained that her hesitation wasn’t about me but rather her own insecurities about finances. We ended up having a constructive conversation about our financial goals and how we can navigate these situations better in the future.

I asked my roommate if she could keep the noise down just a bit since I was trying to finish my work, and she obliged. 

As the night went on, I could still hear everything, so around 10 PM, I decided to retreat to the library to finish my assignment in peace. I let my roommate know I was leaving and that I would be back once I was done. I finally finished around 11:45 PM and headed back home. When I walked in, the party was still going strong, and I felt a bit out of place. 

My roommate noticed I was back and apologized again for the noise, saying she didn’t realize it was bothering me so much. I told her that I appreciated her trying to keep it down, but she seemed a bit disappointed that I hadn’t stayed for the fun. We ended up having a quick chat, and she said it was “kind of a bummer” that I missed out on the night.

I felt bad for not participating in her gathering, but I also knew I needed to prioritize my schoolwork. I’ve been questioning whether I should have just put my assignment aside for a little to join her, or if I was justified in prioritizing my responsibilities.

No one is the Asshole,"My friend Sarah (28F) recently got a new puppy, and she was super excited about it. She’s been sharing updates and adorable photos, which I love seeing. However, I noticed that she’s been struggling a bit with training him. The puppy is really energetic and sometimes a handful, and she mentioned feeling overwhelmed.

I’ve had dogs before, so I offered to help her with some training tips and suggested we do a few training sessions together. I thought it would be a fun way to bond and help her out. She seemed receptive at first, but then I noticed she wasn’t following through with the things we talked about. When I brought it up, she got defensive and said she felt like I was judging her abilities as a dog owner.

I didn’t mean to come off that way at all. I just wanted to share what worked for me in the past. She has since said she appreciates the advice but asked me to back off a bit because she wants to figure things out on her own. I completely understand where she’s coming from, but I also feel a bit hurt because I was just trying to help.

Now I’m wondering if I overstepped by offering my help. I didn’t mean to upset her, but I just wanted to support her. AITA for trying to help her with her puppy?",960,1297,0.78,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_68182,2023-01-21 00:00:00,NAH,1221,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"A few weeks ago, I was hanging out with a close group of friends when the subject of our future career aspirations came up. We all graduated around the same time, and it was interesting to hear everyone’s thoughts. Most of my friends are either in stable corporate jobs or pursuing advanced degrees, but I’ve decided to take a more unconventional route and start my own business, something I’ve been passionate about for a while.

During the discussion, one of my friends, Sarah, who is a bit more traditional in her thinking, expressed concern about my decision. She said she fears for my financial stability and questioned whether I was making the right choice by not following a more conventional career path. In a moment of honesty, I explained that while I appreciate her concern, I believe that following my passion is worth the risk and that I have a solid plan in place. 

However, I may have come off a bit defensive when I said that not everyone is meant for corporate jobs and that it’s important to pursue what makes you happy, even if it’s not the safest option. Sarah got a little upset and said it felt dismissive of her worries. I didn’t mean to belittle her concerns, but I really believe in my choice and everything I’m doing to make it work.

Later, we all discussed it further, and several friends chimed in, agreeing with both sides. Some supported my entrepreneurial spirit while others sympathized with Sarah’s perspective. In the end, we all acknowledged that we care about each other’s futures and want what's best, even if our paths are different. No hard feelings, and we left the conversation understanding each other a bit better.",427,1651,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_23749,2019-04-25 00:00:00,NAH,1659,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"EDIT/UPDATE: Hi everyone! Thank you for your feedback! I talked to the other two roommates about my concerns, and they were really understanding. We were able to find a compromise where we all agreed on a more equitable room distribution based on size. I decided to stay with them after all, and we all feel good about the arrangement. Appreciate the insights!

So, I’m in a bit of a housing situation. I recently started looking for a shared apartment with two friends from college. We found a great place, and after a few showings, we settled on one that we all liked. The issue arose when we got to discussing the room sizes and prices.

I had assumed we would split the rent evenly, but one of my friends pointed out that the master bedroom was significantly larger and naturally should cost more. I agreed, but when it came time to split the rent, my friends insisted that the bigger room should be priced at a much higher rate than the other two, and they suggested that I take the smallest room for a lower rate.

I felt a bit uncomfortable with this, as we had all been looking for a place together and I thought it would be fair to split things more evenly, especially since we all started this search as equals. I mentioned this to them, and while they understood where I was coming from, they still felt that the bigger room should come with a higher price tag.

Now I'm wondering if it’s unreasonable for me to want to push back on this arrangement. I love my friends and want to make this work, but the idea of living in a tiny room while they both have much larger spaces feels off. Would it be wrong of me to suggest we all revisit the pricing structure? I’m worried that it might create tension between us.

No one is the Asshole,"Throwaway because I don't want my friends to find this.

So, I've been part of a close-knit friend group for about six years now. We all hang out regularly, support each other through tough times, and celebrate the good moments together. Recently, one of my friends, let’s call him Jake, went through a tough breakup. Understandably, he was really down about it, and we all wanted to help him out.

One evening, we decided to organize a small get-together at my place to lift his spirits. I prepared some snacks, set up a movie, and made sure there were plenty of drinks. A couple of friends brought over board games, and we all settled in for a fun night. The atmosphere was great, and at first, Jake seemed to be enjoying himself.

However, as the night went on, Jake started to pull away from the group. He was getting quieter and less engaged. I noticed that he was scrolling through his phone a lot, and it seemed like he was checking up on his ex. Concerned, I approached him and suggested we talk about how he was feeling, but he brushed me off, saying he just wanted to be alone for a bit.

I respected that and didn’t want to push him too hard, so I tried to get everyone else involved in the games and the movie. But throughout the night, Jake continued to isolate himself, and I could see he was visibly upset. Eventually, I decided to check in on him again, and this time, he snapped at me, saying I was being too overbearing and that he just needed some space.

I felt really conflicted because I wanted to support him, but I also didn’t want to make things worse. I apologized and gave him space for the rest of the night. The next day, I sent him a message to check in and let him know I was there for him whenever he wanted to talk.

Some of my other friends later mentioned that I should’ve just left him alone completely, and that I should have read the room better. I felt bad for trying to help but also understood that everyone handles things differently. 

Looking back, I still believe my intention was to support him, but I wonder if I overstepped. So, am I the asshole for trying to check in on a friend who was struggling, or was I just trying to be a good friend?",622,1493,0.88,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_32946,2022-04-11 00:00:00,NAH,2190,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My family has always had a complicated relationship with my younger brother, Mark. He was diagnosed with ADHD at a young age, and while my parents were incredibly loving, they often struggled to find the right balance in raising him. They've always been very protective and sometimes overly accommodating, which led to a lot of tension in the family dynamics.

A few months ago, my parents decided to throw a big birthday party for Mark's 18th, and they wanted it to be a surprise. I was genuinely excited and helped them with the planning, but I also noticed that they were still treating him more like a child than an adult. They made all the decisions without consulting him, which I thought was unfair.

On the day of the party, Mark seemed overwhelmed by the amount of attention and expectations placed on him. I could see the anxiety building up in him, and when it came time to give his speech, he froze. Instead of enjoying his moment, he ended up leaving the room and sitting outside. I followed him out, and we talked for a while. I told him that it was okay to feel overwhelmed and that he didn’t have to please everyone all the time. We ended up laughing about some funny memories from our childhood, and I felt like we connected in a way we hadn't in years.

When we went back inside, I noticed my parents were upset. They thought I had undermined their efforts by talking to him outside and taking him away from the party. I tried to explain that I just wanted Mark to feel comfortable and supported, but they felt I had overstepped.

Now, my parents are upset with me for ""ruining"" their surprise party, and I feel like I was just trying to help my brother. AITA?",777,1757,0.65,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_99182,2022-01-07 00:00:00,NAH,1678,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I really need some outside perspective on a situation that's been weighing heavily on me.

A couple of years ago, I volunteered to be a mentor for a local youth program aimed at helping at-risk teens. I was excited about it because I love working with kids and thought I could make a difference in a young person's life. I was paired with a 15-year-old boy, and for the past two years, we've developed a good rapport. I helped him with schoolwork, talked about life choices, and encouraged him in his interests.

Recently, I’ve been feeling overwhelmed with my own life. My job has become increasingly demanding, and I'm working long hours to handle the stress of my responsibilities. I’ve also been trying to balance my own personal life issues, and I feel like I haven't been able to dedicate the time and energy that my mentee deserves. I worry that I’m not being the supportive figure he needs right now.

After a lot of thought, I decided to talk to my mentee about possibly stepping back from my role. I explained that I still care about him and want the best for him, but that I need to focus on my own well-being for a while. He was understanding but also expressed disappointment, saying that our time together has been really meaningful for him.

Now I’m feeling guilty for wanting to step back. I know the program encourages long-term connections, and I feel like I’m letting him down by not being able to continue. But at the same time, I realize that I can’t be an effective mentor if I’m struggling myself.

So, Am I the asshole for wanting to prioritize my own mental health and possibly leaving my mentoring role? Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.",792,2421,0.92,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_56092,2021-09-01 00:00:00,NAH,1674,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I recently had a situation with my partner over our different approaches to planning family outings with our kids. We have two children, ages 7 and 5, and both of us love spending time with them. However, I prefer spontaneous trips to local parks or museums, while my partner likes to meticulously plan every detail, from the budget to the schedule.

Last weekend, I suggested we go to a nearby nature reserve for a picnic. I was excited about keeping it simple: grab some sandwiches, pack a blanket, and head out. My partner was hesitant because they felt it was too last minute and insisted we should have a proper plan in place. We ended up in a bit of a disagreement, with my partner feeling overwhelmed by my casual approach and me feeling frustrated with the need for excessive planning.

In the end, we decided to compromise. We agreed to plan one outing a month in advance but allow for spontaneous trips on weekends as well. The kids had a great time at the nature reserve, and it reminded me that both approaches have their merits. 

After reflecting on the situation, I realized that neither of us was in the wrong; we just have different styles when it comes to family activities. Both approaches can be valid, and it's important to find a balance that works for our family.

No one is the Asshole,"So this just happened, and I’m still processing it. I was hanging out with my friends at a local café when we struck up a conversation about our favorite childhood games. It was all in good fun, and everyone was sharing their nostalgia.

My friend Mark mentioned how he loved playing Pokémon as a kid, and I chimed in that I used to collect the cards and play the video games. Then, out of nowhere, Sarah, who was relatively quiet until then, suddenly criticized us for being obsessed with ""kid stuff"" and suggested we should be more mature.

At first, I thought she was joking, but she was serious. I was taken aback and said something like, “Hey, everyone has their interests, and it’s okay to enjoy things from our childhood.” Mark agreed, and I could see some tension building.

Then, in an attempt to lighten the mood, I jokingly suggested we all gather our Pokémon cards for a tournament and see who would win. Sarah rolled her eyes and said, “Wow, that sounds really lame.” I felt a bit defensive and told her that if she didn’t want to join, that was fine, but she could at least respect what others enjoy.

The conversation went on, and while we didn’t argue, it felt awkward after that. Sarah eventually left early, and I felt bad for how things had turned out. I don’t think anyone was really in the wrong, but it seemed like a clash of perspectives on what’s fun and what’s not.

So, Reddit, was I being too defensive of our interests, or was Sarah just being snobbish about our childhood games? Was I an asshole for trying to defend our fun? ESH? NAH?",891,2711,0.75,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_24452,2022-07-21 00:00:00,NAH,1564,AITA

I have a close friend, Sarah, who recently went through a tough breakup. She's been feeling really down, and I’ve been trying to be there for her as much as I can. We decided to plan a small get-together with a few friends to help lift her spirits. 

The day of the gathering, I noticed that one of our friends, Mark, who was also invited, was acting a bit off. He seemed distant and wasn’t engaging in conversations as he normally would. I knew that he was dealing with some personal issues, so I approached him privately to check in. During our conversation, he opened up about some family problems he was facing and how stressed he was feeling.

I felt it was important to support him too, so I suggested that he join in on the gathering, thinking it would do him some good to be around friends. However, when I mentioned it to him, he got upset and said he didn't want to bring down the mood. I assured him that we’d love to have him, but he was still hesitant. Eventually, I convinced him to come, hoping that being around friends would help him feel better.

At the gathering, things started off well, but as the night went on, I could tell that Mark was still feeling low. Sarah, on the other hand, was trying to enjoy herself, but I noticed she kept looking over at Mark, concerned about him. I felt torn because I wanted to support both of them, but it was clear that the energy was a bit off.

Eventually, I pulled Sarah aside and suggested that we might want to focus more on her and give Mark some space, maybe even encourage him to leave early if he needed to. Sarah agreed, and we both approached Mark, letting him know it was okay if he wanted to head out. He ended up leaving, and I felt guilty for having invited him in the first place.

Afterwards, I spoke with Sarah about how we could have handled things better. She appreciated my concern for Mark but also felt that we shouldn’t have let his mood overshadow her night. We both realized that it was a tough balancing act, and we had good intentions, even if things didn’t go as planned.

I’ve been feeling guilty about whether I should have insisted Mark stay away that night or if I was right to try and include him. I just wanted to help both of my friends, but it ended up feeling like a tough situation for everyone involved.

We had planned the meals together, and I thought I was being considerate by making sure there were options for everyone. However, I didn't realize that one of the snacks I brought contained an ingredient that my partner can't eat. When they saw it, they became visibly upset and started to express their frustration loudly in front of everyone, which made things awkward.

I come from a large family, and family gatherings are a big part of my life. I love spending time with my siblings and their kids, and every year we have a big family reunion that I look forward to.

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been discussing wanting to try out a new hobby together, and recently, we both started getting into rock climbing. We’ve been looking for a local climbing gym that offers beginner classes. After some research, we found a gym that has great reviews and caters to newcomers.

When we approached the gym to book our first class, we learned they had a special program for individuals with disabilities, including adaptive climbing sessions. While we both wholeheartedly support these initiatives, I noticed that the gym had a number of time slots open for adaptive climbing that overlapped with the beginner classes.

I thought it would be great to bring more awareness to the adaptive climbing program, so I suggested to my partner that we could try the adaptive climbing session instead of the regular beginner class. My partner agreed that it could be an enriching experience, and we planned to participate in one of those sessions.

After sharing our plans with some friends, I got mixed reactions. Some friends commended us for wanting to support and participate in a program that promotes inclusivity, while others felt it was inappropriate for us to take spots from climbers with actual disabilities, even though the gym assured us that they encourage anyone to join the session regardless of ability.

We ultimately decided that we wouldn't feel comfortable taking a spot if it meant displacing someone who truly needed it. We expressed our intention to the gym to potentially volunteer instead, helping out during those adaptive sessions.

Now, I'm unsure if we handled this situation correctly. Were we right to consider participating in adaptive climbing, or did we overstep by thinking we could benefit from that program?

I completely understood and supported her decision, but then she invited a cousin of ours that I have a complicated relationship with. This cousin has made some hurtful comments about my weight and has been generally unsupportive in the past.

I felt uncomfortable about her being there and worried it might ruin the day for me and for my sister. So, I told my sister how I felt, explaining my past experiences with our cousin and how it might affect my ability to fully enjoy the wedding. My sister listened but ultimately decided to keep the invitation as is, saying it was important to her to have family there.

I didn’t want to cause drama, so I decided to suck it up and attend the wedding. I was supportive throughout the planning process and was genuinely happy for my sister. However, when the day came, my cousin made a couple of offhand comments that triggered me, and I ended up stepping outside just to breathe and gather myself.

After the wedding, my sister reached out to me, concerned about how I was feeling. I explained what happened and how the comments affected me. She apologized for not fully understanding my feelings earlier, and we had a good conversation about boundaries and family dynamics.

I don’t think either of us was in the wrong – my sister wanted to include family, and I wanted to express my feelings honestly. We both care about each other, and I think we navigated the situation as best we could. I just hope it didn’t create any tension between us.",202,1777,0.68,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_86660,2024-12-17 00:00:00,NAH,1823,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Throwaway account because my friends are on social media.

I have a close group of friends, and we all take turns hosting our monthly game nights. Recently, it was my turn to host, and I was excited to have everyone over for some board games and pizza. I’ve been trying to create a welcoming atmosphere that everyone enjoys, and I always take into consideration any dietary restrictions.

One of my friends, let’s call her Sarah, has been going through a tough time lately. She recently lost her job and has been feeling pretty down about it. I wanted to do something special to cheer her up, so I planned a surprise element for game night: I set up a little “cheer up” gift for her, which included her favorite snacks, a nice card, and a small care package with some self-care items. I thought this would be a nice distraction for her and show her we care.

During game night, when everyone arrived, I surprised Sarah with the gift. She was genuinely touched, and it made her smile, which was my goal. However, my other friends had mixed reactions. Some were supportive and thought it was a lovely gesture, but a few felt uncomfortable, thinking it was too much attention on Sarah when the night was supposed to be about all of us hanging out together.

After the surprise, the mood shifted slightly, and I could sense some tension. We ended up playing games, but I noticed a few people were a bit withdrawn. I later overheard one friend saying that it felt like I was trying to make the night all about Sarah and that it overshadowed the usual fun we all had together.

I didn’t mean to upset anyone, and I genuinely just wanted to lift Sarah's spirits. Now I’m feeling confused about whether I overstepped or if I was just trying to be a good friend. So, Reddit, am I the asshole for trying to support my friend during a tough time?",587,1920,0.56,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_46840,2023-11-28 00:00:00,NAH,1835,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Last month, I attended my cousin's wedding. She had been planning this day for two years, and it was supposed to be the happiest occasion for her. The ceremony was beautiful, but things took a turn during the reception. The best man decided to give a toast that was far too long and went off-script. Instead of sharing heartfelt memories, he started telling embarrassing stories about my cousin that made her visibly uncomfortable. 

At first, everyone laughed, but as he kept going, I noticed my cousin's smile fading. I felt I had to step in, so I stood up and politely interrupted him, saying, ""Hey, let's keep it light and fun! This is a celebration, not a roast!"" The best man looked taken aback, and I could see my cousin relax a bit as the crowd shifted their focus back to the celebration.

After the wedding, I overheard some family members discussing my interruption. Some thought it was a necessary move to protect my cousin, while others felt I was rude for interrupting the best man. I’m having mixed feelings about it. I didn’t mean to cause any tension, and I genuinely wanted to ensure my cousin had a good time on her special day.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently had a situation with my roommate that I’m not sure how to feel about. We’ve been living together for a year, and overall, we get along pretty well. However, we have different expectations when it comes to cleaning the common areas of our apartment.

Last week, I noticed that the living room was getting pretty cluttered and dirty. I’m someone who likes to keep things tidy, while my roommate tends to be more laid back about it. I didn’t mind picking up after myself, but I felt that it had become a shared responsibility, and I wanted to talk about it.

So, I brought it up casually, suggesting that we establish a cleaning schedule for the common areas. My roommate seemed to take it personally and said that I was being controlling and that she felt judged about her way of living. I tried to explain that it wasn't about her personal habits but more about maintaining a pleasant space for both of us. She got defensive and said I should just accept how things are, which led to a bit of a heated argument.

After the confrontation, I felt bad. I didn’t want her to feel like I was attacking her character or lifestyle. I just genuinely thought it would be helpful to have some structure. Later, I apologized for how the conversation turned out and tried to reassure her that I appreciate her as a roommate.

We ended up having a more constructive talk afterward, where we both expressed our feelings and came to a compromise about cleaning without either of us feeling like we were stepping on each other’s toes.

Now I'm wondering if I was an asshole for bringing it up the way I did or if it was reasonable to want to address the cleaning issue. I really didn’t mean to hurt her feelings. Was it wrong of me to want a cleaner space?",117,2106,0.55,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_52770,2018-03-23 00:00:00,NAH,1750,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been together for a few years and we both have strong opinions about various aspects of our lives. Recently, we got into a heated debate about how to handle our holiday traditions, and it escalated into a pretty intense argument. I’m starting to wonder if one of us is being unreasonable, so I’d like some outside perspective on this.

I grew up in a family where we had specific holiday traditions that were very meaningful to me. For example, every year we would decorate our tree on Christmas Eve, and we had a special meal that my mom would always make. These traditions made the holidays feel special and magical, and I really want to carry them on into my own family.

My partner, on the other hand, has a very different holiday background. They grew up celebrating with a different set of traditions, and they are really attached to those. They want to incorporate their traditions into our celebrations, which I understand, but they aren't really aligned with what I consider the ""core"" of what makes the holidays special for me.

The argument started when I suggested we keep my traditions because they hold so much sentimental value for me. I proposed that we could blend our traditions a bit, but I wanted to prioritize mine since I feel they represent the essence of what I want our holidays to be like.

My partner was really upset by this and felt like I was dismissing their own family history and experiences. They accused me of being selfish and not considering how important their traditions are to them. I was frustrated because it felt like a personal attack on something I care deeply about. In the moment, I told them that I didn’t want to compromise on something that was so important to me.

After some time apart to think, I can see their perspective. I truly value their traditions too, and I don’t want to hurt them by being so rigid about mine. At the same time, I feel a strong connection to my own family’s ways of celebrating.

So, I’m left wondering if I was being unreasonable or if we both just have valid points. AITA for wanting to prioritize my holiday traditions?",234,2734,0.68,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_22755,2022-01-24 00:00:00,NAH,2123,AITA

Eventually, I decided to go ahead and host the game night without them, thinking they would be okay with it since they could take the night off for themselves. I communicated with them before the event, expressing my intentions and asking for their blessing. They seemed a bit upset but didn’t outright say I shouldn’t go through with it. 

The night went well, and everyone had a great time, but when I got home, my partner was clearly upset that I had gone through with it. They felt left out and said I should have respected their feelings more by postponing the event entirely. I apologized for not considering their perspective enough and for not checking in with them after hearing their initial concerns.

However, there’s been a lot of tension lately due to a project that my team is working on. It’s a high-pressure situation that has required us to put in extra hours and really ramp up our productivity. I’ve been doing my best to keep up, but I also have a family at home who relies on me.

Recently, my sister reached out and asked if I could help her with a home renovation project. She and her husband are expecting their first child, and they really want to get their house ready before the baby arrives. I agreed to help, but I didn’t realize just how much time it would take. I’ve been spending weekends there, and it’s been exhausting, especially with everything going on at work.

Last weekend, I was at my sister’s house, and she mentioned that she feels overwhelmed and could really use some extra help from me. I want to support her, but I also have deadlines looming at work, and I’m feeling stretched thin. I told her that while I want to be there for her, I really need to prioritize my job right now. 

This sparked a bit of a disagreement. She got upset, claiming that I was prioritizing my job over family. I tried to explain that if I don’t meet my work obligations, I might risk my position, which could ultimately impact my ability to support my family in the long run. 

When I returned home, I talked with my partner about the situation. They suggested that I set some boundaries with my sister and communicate my limitations more clearly. I decided to send my sister a message explaining that I can help her, but I need to limit my availability to one day a week for now, as I need to focus on my work and my own well-being.

No one is the Asshole,"I recently attended a small family gathering for my cousin's birthday. It was a casual get-together with cake, games, and a few gifts. My cousin is 10 years younger than me, and while we grew up together, we haven't been as close in recent years due to life changes. I wanted to make the day special for her, so I decided to bring a gift that I thought she would enjoy—a beautiful art set since she's been getting into painting recently.

When I arrived, I noticed she seemed a bit off and was quieter than usual. After some time, I learned that she had been feeling insecure about her art skills and had even considered quitting completely. Feeling empathetic, I shared with her some of my own struggles when I was exploring art, and I encouraged her to keep going and not to compare herself to others. 

Later, when it was time to open gifts, my cousin seemed excited but also anxious. When she opened my gift, she was genuinely thrilled! She thanked me and said it was just what she needed. However, I noticed that her mood shifted slightly when she opened another gift from a family member—a gift card to a prominent art supply store. 

She smiled and thanked them, but I could see that she started to compare herself to me, as if my gift wasn't enough. I tried to reassure her that all gifts are special and that what really matters is how much joy we find in our hobbies, not in what we receive. I told her she didn't need to feel pressured to be like anyone else and that everyone has their own unique journey in art and life.

After the party, I reached out to her to see how she was feeling, and she said she appreciated my support but still felt a little overshadowed by the other gift. I assured her that her feelings were valid and that it was completely natural to feel that way sometimes. We ended up having a nice conversation about our passions and insecurities.

I genuinely hope I helped her feel a bit more confident, but I also wonder if I should have been more aware of her feelings when I chose my gift.

I've become friends with a few colleagues, and one of them, I'll call him Mike, invited me to a game night at his place. I was excited, as I enjoy board games and thought it would be a good way to meet more people.

When I arrived, I noticed that there was a mix of people in attendance, some of whom I had met before and others who were new to me. The night started off great, and I was having a lot of fun. During one of the games, I got a little competitive and joked around a lot, trying to keep the mood light. I tend to be a bit loud when I’m excited, and I might have raised my voice a few times.

At one point, there was a joke made that included a bit of playful teasing, and I responded with a comment that I thought was funny but may have come off as a bit harsh. I didn’t intend to hurt anyone’s feelings; I was just trying to keep the energy up. Afterward, I noticed that one of the guests, a woman named Sarah, seemed a bit uncomfortable and quiet, which I didn’t initially recognize.

Later in the evening, during a lull in the game, Sarah approached me and mentioned that she sometimes finds loud, competitive environments a bit overwhelming, and she appreciated if I could tone it down a little. I could sense that she was feeling anxious about bringing it up, so I assured her that I completely understood and would be mindful of my volume and energy for the rest of the night.

To my surprise, Mike later told me that a couple of people had mentioned feeling uncomfortable with my earlier comments and behavior. I felt bad because I genuinely didn’t mean to make anyone feel that way. I apologized to everyone and let them know I didn’t intend to offend. 

In the end, we all ended up having a good time, but I still felt a bit guilty for making anyone uncomfortable. I think it was just a case of different personalities and communication styles clashing, and I’m still learning how to navigate social situations in my new city.

So, I (29f) recently went to a friend's wedding. It was a beautiful event, and I was really looking forward to celebrating with everyone. I knew quite a few guests, but there were also a lot of people I had never met before.

During the reception, my friend’s younger sister (let's call her Lisa, 25) approached me. We started chatting, and she seemed a bit stressed about the whole wedding thing. Lisa mentioned that she had been tasked with organizing the seating arrangements and was feeling overwhelmed, especially since some guests were not sitting where they wanted to be.

I could see she was anxious, so I offered to help her rearrange some seating. We both went over to the tables and started moving things around, trying to accommodate everyone’s preferences. While we were working on it, I noticed that the bride’s aunt (who I didn’t know well) was sitting alone at a table and looked a bit upset.

I suggested to Lisa that we check on her and see if she wanted to join the group at a different table. As we approached the aunt, I realized that she was actually quite upset because she felt excluded during the event. I did my best to comfort her and invited her to come join the more lively table where everyone was having fun.

After a bit of coaxing, she agreed, and we helped her move. I thought it was a nice gesture, but when we returned to the seating area, Lisa was really upset with me. She felt that I undermined her authority by making changes without consulting her first. I apologized to her and explained I was just trying to help, but she was still angry.

Ultimately, I think my intentions were good, and I just wanted everyone to feel included. I didn't mean to step on Lisa’s toes, but she felt I disrespected her role in the wedding.

I’ve always struggled with traditional formal clothing; it makes me feel very uncomfortable and not like myself at all. I mentioned to my partner that I’d prefer to wear something more comfortable, like nice slacks and a dress shirt, instead of a formal suit. My partner understands how I feel and agrees that it’s important to be comfortable, but they also think I should at least meet the formality of the event out of respect for our friend.

I have a younger sister, Emily, who’s 12, and she’s been really excited about her upcoming school play. She’s been rehearsing for weeks and is set to play a major role. Our parents are really supportive, and they’ve been helping her with scripts, costumes, and even driving her to rehearsals. 

About a month ago, my close friend, Jake, invited me to a concert that falls on the same night as Emily’s play. The concert is for a band we both love, and I’ve been looking forward to it for a long time. However, I promised Emily I would go to her play and support her. 

With the concert getting closer, I started feeling torn. I talked to my parents, and they encouraged me to go to the concert, saying that Emily would understand since she has been practicing so hard. They suggested I could just go to the play for the first half and then leave for the concert. I brought this up to Emily, and she was visibly upset. She told me how much it would mean to her to have me there for the entire performance and that she wanted to see me in the audience cheering her on.

I ended up deciding to stay for the entirety of her play, knowing it was important to her. I told Jake that I wouldn’t be able to make it to the concert, and while he was disappointed, he was understanding.

Now, I’m feeling a bit guilty because I missed out on something I was really looking forward to, and I wonder if I should have gone to the concert instead. I know Emily appreciated my support, but I can’t shake the feeling that I sacrificed my own fun for her.

So, Reddit, was I wrong for choosing my sister’s play over my concert plans? Am I the asshole for prioritizing family support over my own interests?

No one is the Asshole,"My partner (35F) and I (34M) have been together for several years now, and we recently got engaged. We’re both really excited about our future and have started planning our wedding. One thing we’ve been discussing is the possibility of me taking her last name after we get married.

Growing up, I always felt like my last name didn’t represent who I truly am. It’s quite common and lacks any personal significance for me. My family has a history of being really traditional and holding on tightly to our last names, and while I love my family, I’ve often felt out of place in that environment. 

My fiancé, on the other hand, has a unique last name that has a beautiful meaning and a rich family history. Her family is incredibly supportive and open-minded, which has made me feel more comfortable about the idea. I see taking her name as not just a gesture of love, but also a way to embrace my own identity and break away from the constraints of tradition that I’ve never really felt connected to.

However, we also have to consider her family dynamic. She has a younger brother who feels strongly about maintaining the family name, and I can tell he would be uncomfortable with me changing to hers. I’ve tried to discuss my feelings with her family, but they seem to be stuck in their views about names being tied to family lineage and heritage.

We’re both genuinely trying to navigate this situation with care. I don’t want to hurt her brother or create any family rifts, but I also want to honor my own identity and my love for my fiancé. We’re considering various compromises, like creating a hyphenated name or even using her last name socially while keeping mine legally.

In the end, we both just want to make this decision together and respect everyone’s feelings. It’s a complex situation, but we’re approaching it with love and understanding. I feel like there are no clear villains here; we’re just two people trying to blend our lives and values in a way that respects both our families.",294,1887,0.78,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_65940,2020-01-15 00:00:00,NAH,2002,AITA

However, a few weeks later, he told me that he wasn’t sure he wanted to go to therapy and that he preferred to just talk things out with me instead.

He seemed upset and accused me of not being supportive. I tried to clarify that I was supportive, but I wanted him to get the best help possible.

No one is the Asshole,"I've been friends with Sarah for about seven years now, and we've always supported each other in our personal lives. Recently, I started a new job, and I was really excited to share the news with her. I told her about the role and mentioned that I would be working longer hours than I used to. Sarah seemed visibly upset about it, and when I asked her why, she said that she felt like I wouldn’t have time for our friendship anymore.

I reassured her that I would make time for her, as our friendship is important to me. However, she kept insisting that my new job would take me away from her and that she was worried about losing our bond. I understood that change can be hard, but I also wanted to focus on my new opportunity.

One day, Sarah invited me to join her for a weekend getaway with some friends from college. I would have loved to go, but I explained that I couldn’t take time off just yet because I was still adjusting to my new job and wanted to show commitment. She got really upset and said that I was prioritizing work over our friendship. I tried to explain that it wasn’t about prioritizing, but rather about needing some time to settle in.

After our conversation, I felt torn. I genuinely want to be there for her, but I also need to focus on my career. I suggested that we could plan some regular catch-ups during the week to maintain our friendship, but she seemed unconvinced, believing that I was making excuses.

I [27M] was hanging out with my roommate [26F] and a couple of our friends for a game night. We had snacks, drinks, and were just enjoying each other's company. As the night went on, we started talking about our past relationships, and it turned into some light-hearted teasing.

At one point, my roommate mentioned that she used to date a guy who was a huge gamer, and she joked about how he would always hog the console. Everyone laughed, and it became a running theme for the night. I decided to join in on the teasing and said something like, “Maybe that’s why you’re still single; you scare off all the gamers!” 

It was all in good fun, but I could see her face change a bit. A few minutes later, she left the room to get some snacks, and I overheard her talking to one of our friends. She was expressing that my comment hurt her feelings because she didn’t think I meant it in a light-hearted way.

Later on, I pulled her aside to apologize. I told her I didn’t mean to hurt her and that it was just a joke. She accepted my apology and said she understood, but I could tell she was still a bit upset.

No one is the Asshole,"I (30F) have a close-knit group of friends that I've known since college. We all live in different cities now, but we make it a point to get together for a weekend trip at least once a year. This year's trip was planned for my friend's birthday weekend, and everyone was really excited about it.

A couple of weeks before the trip, one of my friends, Lisa (31F), mentioned that she was going through a tough time at work and feeling really stressed. I suggested that maybe we could do something special for her during the trip, like a little surprise celebration with cake and her favorite snacks. Everyone agreed that it was a nice idea.

As the weekend approached, I took it upon myself to organize the surprise. I coordinated with everyone to bring snacks, drinks, and a cake. I also wanted to make sure we had a cozy atmosphere, so I brought some decorations. I was really looking forward to seeing Lisa’s reaction.

When the day arrived, we set everything up while Lisa was out with another friend. She came back to a room filled with decorations, her favorite cake, and all of us singing ""Happy Birthday."" Lisa looked genuinely surprised and incredibly touched. She was grateful for the gesture, but I could tell she was also a bit overwhelmed.

Later that evening, Lisa mentioned that she didn’t want to celebrate her birthday this year because she was feeling down about work and didn't want the added pressure of being “the birthday girl.” I felt bad because I realized that my intentions to cheer her up may have inadvertently added more stress instead of alleviating it.

I apologized to Lisa and told her that I just wanted to do something nice for her, but I understood if she wasn’t feeling up to celebrating. We spent the rest of the evening just hanging out and talking, which seemed to help her.

Now, I find myself wondering if I overstepped by organizing the surprise without fully considering Lisa's feelings. Was it wrong of me to want to celebrate her, even if she wasn’t in the mood?

No one is the Asshole,"I (27f) am feeling a bit conflicted, and I'm hoping for some perspective from you all. Last weekend, I hosted a small gathering at my apartment for some friends to celebrate my birthday. It was a casual get-together with about ten people, and I was really looking forward to it. I had planned everything, from the food to the drinks, and I wanted everyone to have a good time.

As the night went on, I noticed that one of my friends, Jake (28m), seemed a bit off. He was sitting in the corner, scrolling on his phone, and not engaging in any conversations. I approached him to check in and see if he was okay. He told me that he was feeling anxious and overwhelmed by the crowd, so I suggested that we step outside for some fresh air.

Once we were outside, I asked if there was anything specific bothering him. He opened up about some personal struggles he’s been having recently, including issues at work and feeling disconnected from friends. I empathized with him and assured him that he wasn’t alone. I also encouraged him to join us again when he felt ready.

While we were talking, though, I could hear some of my other friends laughing and having a good time inside. After a while, I noticed that they seemed to be missing Jake, too. I didn't want to keep him from enjoying the party, so I suggested that we head back in together. But Jake hesitated, saying he wasn’t sure if he wanted to go back in.

I felt torn. I wanted to support Jake, but I also wanted to make sure my friends were having a good time and that the atmosphere of the party didn’t suffer. Eventually, I told him that it was okay if he didn’t want to go back in, but I also wanted to respect my other friends and the energy of the celebration. I suggested that maybe he could try to join us for just a few minutes, and if he felt overwhelmed, he could step outside again.

Jake took this the wrong way, and he said he felt pressured to return and that I wasn’t being understanding. I quickly apologized, but I also felt that I was trying to find a balance between being a good host and being there for him as a friend.

Emily has been in a serious relationship for about a year now. Her boyfriend, Mark, is a nice guy, but he tends to be very protective and overbearing. At first, I thought it was just me being overly sensitive, but it’s become more obvious over time. Whenever we hang out as a group, he has a tendency to dominate conversations, and I’ve noticed he often directs Emily’s choices, even things like what she should wear or what she should eat. 

Last week, we had a family gathering, and I noticed Mark telling Emily that she shouldn’t eat the dessert because it was unhealthy. I felt uncomfortable watching her defer to him and not speak up for herself. Afterward, I pulled her aside and expressed my concerns, saying I thought it was important for her to make her own choices and that I felt Mark was being too controlling.

Emily got upset and told me that I was overreacting and that she appreciated Mark's concern for her health. We ended up arguing a bit, and she said I was just trying to create drama in her relationship. I didn't mean to come off that way, but I genuinely worry about her. She’s an adult, and she can make her own decisions, but I just wanted to look out for her.

We were inseparable from elementary school all the way through high school, but after graduation, life pulled us in different directions. We stayed in touch for a few years, but eventually, we drifted apart, and I haven't spoken to her in about five years.

When I received the wedding invitation, I was surprised but also excited to see her again. However, upon reading the details, I noticed that the wedding is taking place in her hometown, which is quite far from where I live now, and the date falls on a long holiday weekend. I have plans with my partner to go on a trip that weekend, and we've already booked everything.

I felt bad about not being able to attend, especially since we were so close growing up. I debated whether to reach out to her and explain my situation, but I ultimately decided to just send a card with my congratulations and a small gift instead. I figured she would understand that life happens and that I am genuinely happy for her.

Later, I found out from a mutual friend that my best friend was really upset that I didn't make the effort to attend her wedding. They said she felt abandoned and thought I didn’t care about our friendship. I never intended to hurt her feelings, and I wish I had communicated better about my situation.

No one is the Asshole,"Okay, so I’ll give you some context. I’ve been working at a community center for the past three years, where I run after-school programs for kids in the neighborhood. I love my job and the kids I work with, but it does require a lot of my time, and I often find myself working late hours to prepare for events or meetings.

Recently, my best friend, who is also a single parent, reached out to me. Her son has been struggling with anxiety and depression since his father passed away last year. She told me that he has been having a really tough time adjusting and that he could use some extra emotional support. She asked if I could take some time off to help him through this rough patch since I'm one of the few people he feels comfortable around.

I thought about it a lot. My job is important to me, but I also care deeply for my friend and her son. I decided to talk to my supervisor about taking a temporary leave of absence so I could help them out. I was fully prepared for the conversation to go poorly, but to my surprise, my boss was incredibly understanding and supportive. She agreed to let me take a month off with the option to extend it if I needed more time.

After I told my friend the good news, she was incredibly grateful. I’ve been spending time with her son, helping him engage in some activities he enjoys, and just being there to listen when he needs to talk. It’s been heartwarming to see him start to open up and feel a bit better.

However, some friends and family have been critical of my decision. They argue that I should prioritize my job and financial stability over helping out a friend’s child. They think I’m being irresponsible by taking a break from work, especially since I’m not getting paid during this time.

On the other hand, I feel like I did the right thing. It’s important to help those we love, especially when they are going through tough times. I believe that emotional support is just as crucial as financial security, and I would hope someone would do the same for me if I were in their shoes.

The pace is fast, the social scene can be cliquish, and the cost of living is significantly higher than what he’s used to. 

I had a conversation with Alex about this, hoping to share some of my experiences to help him ease into the transition. I mentioned that he might want to look for housing a little outside the city center to save money and that he should be prepared for a longer commute. I also suggested he join some local groups or clubs to meet people, as it can be hard to make friends in such a big place.

However, I also have a passion for science, which I want to pursue further. This year, I’ve been given the opportunity to take a dual enrollment science course at a nearby community college that would not only give me college credit but also a chance to explore more about my interests.

Unfortunately, they were firm that missing rehearsals would affect my role in the play, and they suggested I should prioritize the theater program, as we’ve already invested a lot of time in the production.

She’s a huge fan of themed parties, and this year she decided to have a movie night where everyone was supposed to dress up as their favorite movie character. I was really excited about it and planned to go as a character from one of my all-time favorite films.

However, the day before the party, I came down with a bad cold. I was feeling pretty miserable and knew I wouldn't enjoy the party if I went.

I felt terrible that she was struggling, and I apologized for not realizing that being around so many people might be too much for her right now. I offered to leave with her, but she insisted that she wanted to stay, just to get through the evening.

After the barbecue, Sarah and I had a heart-to-heart. She told me that while she appreciates my efforts to include her, she felt pressured to be social when she just needed some time to herself to heal. I assured her that I understood and that I would never want to push her into situations that make her uncomfortable. 

I think we both learned something from this experience. I wanted to be a good friend and support her, but I also realized that sometimes giving support means respecting someone's need for space.

No one is the Asshole,"So I'm in my late 20s, and I have a close group of friends that I've known for years. We often hang out together, and recently we've been getting into discussions about life goals and achievements, which has led to some really deep conversations.

One night, we were talking about our careers, and most of my friends are in stable jobs, while I’m currently working on a startup that’s still in its early stages. I’ve been pouring my heart and soul into it, but it's been tough, and I can't really say I’ve achieved much yet. 

As the conversation went on, I started feeling more and more anxious as my friends shared their successes and milestones. I didn't want to feel left out, so I kind of exaggerated my situation a bit and mentioned that I had some big clients lined up and that we were on the verge of closing a major deal, even though it was still just a hopeful prospect.

After I said that, I felt guilty because I didn’t want to mislead them; I just wanted to feel included and not come off as a failure. A couple of my friends seemed really impressed, and I could tell they were genuinely excited for me, which made me feel even worse for not being honest.

Eventually, I decided to come clean and told them the truth about my startup and how things were still in the works. They were understanding and supportive, which made me feel better. I realize now that it’s okay to be in a different place in life and that I don’t need to embellish my experiences to fit in.

So, was it wrong of me to stretch the truth a bit in the moment, or is it understandable considering the pressures of the conversation?",944,2622,0.57,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_27953,2021-01-30 00:00:00,NAH,1615,AITA

A couple of weeks ago, she mentioned she'd like to have a bachelorette party in Vegas and wanted me to help organize it. I was completely on board and excited to plan something fun for her.

However, as we were discussing the details, she mentioned she wanted to invite a few people I don’t really get along with. One of them is someone who has made some pretty hurtful comments about me in the past. I told her that I think it would be awkward for me if they were there and suggested we keep the guest list to just our close friends.

My friend got upset and said I was being selfish and trying to take away her joy. She said it was her party and she wanted to include the people she considers friends. I felt really torn because I want her to have the best time possible, but I also want to feel comfortable during the celebration.

I ended up telling her that if those people were invited, I wouldn’t be able to attend the bachelorette party. Now she’s angry with me, and I feel bad for putting her in a difficult position. Am I the asshole for wanting to avoid a potentially uncomfortable situation? 

Edit/Update: After talking it out, my friend and I came to a compromise. She decided to have two separate parties—one with her wider circle of friends and another smaller, more intimate gathering with just us and a few other close friends. I feel relieved, and I think she is happier too since she gets to celebrate with everyone.

No one is the Asshole,"I’m 32 and my best friend, Sarah, has been in a relationship with her boyfriend, Jason, for the past two years. Sarah is one of the most caring and thoughtful people I know, but lately, she’s been deeply unhappy in her relationship. Jason has been emotionally distant and often dismissive of her feelings, which has taken a toll on her mental health.

A few weeks ago, Sarah came to me in tears, expressing her frustrations and doubts about the relationship. I listened and tried to offer support, but ultimately, I encouraged her to have an open conversation with Jason about her feelings. I thought it was important for her to advocate for herself.

Last weekend, I organized a small get-together with a few friends, including Sarah and Jason. I didn’t intend for it to be a serious discussion, but during the evening, I noticed that Sarah seemed particularly tense. After a few drinks, she began venting about her relationship again. I didn’t mean to, but I unwittingly brought up some of her previous frustrations, hoping it might encourage her to speak up.

Jason, taken aback, became defensive and started to argue with Sarah. It quickly escalated into a heated exchange where Sarah ended up storming out. I felt terrible because I didn’t want to cause a rift between them, but I also believed Sarah needed to voice her feelings.

Afterward, Jason confronted me about what happened. He said that I shouldn’t have brought up their issues in front of everyone, and that I had made things worse for Sarah. I apologized, explaining that I just wanted to help her feel empowered to speak her truth. He was angry and left the party early.

Now, I’m feeling guilty for what happened. I didn’t want to betray Sarah's trust, but I also wanted to support her. I’ve talked to Sarah since, and she’s grateful for my support but upset about how everything went down. I’m wondering if I crossed a line by bringing it up in a group setting.

One of my housemates, Jake, has a habit of coming into the kitchen while I'm cooking and making comments about how my food smells or how he thinks it looks unappetizing. I get that he has different tastes, but it's discouraging to hear him say things like, “That looks gross” or “I have no idea how you eat that.” This has made me a bit self-conscious about my cooking.

So, I decided to ask Jake if he could try to keep those comments to himself while I'm cooking. I explained that I really enjoy making meals and would appreciate his support rather than criticism. He responded that he was just being honest and that he didn’t mean any harm.

Now, things are a bit tense. I feel like I’m entitled to enjoy cooking without feeling judged, but I also understand that he has his own opinions. I want to know if I overreacted by asking him to stop commenting on my meals, or if it’s reasonable for me to want to create a positive cooking environment.

Recently, Jamie invited me to their family’s annual gathering. This is a big deal for them, and they expressed that it meant a lot to have me there. However, I hesitated because I knew that Jamie's family has conservative views, especially regarding friendships. They might misinterpret our closeness as something more than just friends, and I didn’t want to put Jamie in an awkward position.

After thinking it over, I decided to go to the gathering but made it clear to Jamie that I would remain somewhat distant to avoid any uncomfortable questions or assumptions from their family. Jamie seemed a bit taken aback when I mentioned it. They told me that it was important for them to show their family the people they care about, and it hurt them to think I might hold back.

I ended up going to the gathering, and while I maintained some distance, I realized that Jamie felt uncomfortable with my behavior. They later told me that they wanted to introduce me as a close friend, and my behavior might have signaled that I was ashamed of our friendship. I felt terrible and apologized, explaining my concerns about their family’s perception.

In the end, Jamie appreciated my honesty, but they also expressed that they wished I had trusted them to handle any potential awkwardness. We talked it out, and while there were some hurt feelings, we both agreed to learn from the situation.

My daughter immediately came over to me, looking worried. 

I knelt down and asked her what happened, and she said, “I didn’t mean to!” I reassured her that it was okay and that accidents happen. As I was comforting her, the other girl's mom approached and started demanding an apology from my daughter. I explained that it was an accident and my daughter didn’t intend to hurt anyone. 

The mom insisted that my daughter should apologize anyway to teach her a lesson about being careful. I told her that I understood her perspective, but I felt it was more important to teach my daughter that sometimes things happen that we can’t control, and it’s okay to acknowledge that without blaming her. 

After a few back-and-forth comments, I decided it was best to leave the park, feeling uncomfortable with the situation. I didn’t want to put my daughter in a position to apologize for something she didn’t do intentionally.

Recently, my mom asked me to help my brother with the game since he was struggling with a particularly tough level. I agreed, thinking it would be a nice way to bond with him. However, when I started helping him out, I noticed that he was getting a little too frustrated and upset when he kept failing.

My brother was initially annoyed, but eventually, he agreed. We ended up having a lot of fun playing the new game, and I could see he was much happier.

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been together for several years and are planning to get married soon. We both come from different cultural backgrounds—I'm from a Hispanic family, and my partner is from a Western European background. 

As we started discussing wedding traditions, we came across the topic of the ceremony itself. I grew up with very vibrant, traditional Hispanic weddings that often include a lot of family involvement, cultural rituals, and a big celebration. My partner, on the other hand, has a more low-key, minimalist vision for our wedding, which he describes as ""simple and elegant.""

Initially, I felt that my partner was dismissing my cultural background and the importance of my traditions. I expressed my concern that a simple wedding wouldn't reflect who we are as a couple or honor my family's customs. He felt hurt and said I was being controlling and not considering his preferences or vision for our special day. 

After several discussions, we realized that we were both coming from a place of love but had different ways of expressing it. We eventually decided to blend our ideas: we'll incorporate some of my cultural traditions—like a traditional dance and specific music—while also keeping some of the simplicity that my partner values. 

This compromise has allowed us both to feel respected and valued in our relationship. We acknowledged that our differences don't make us incompatible; rather, they enrich our partnership. 

We are both excited about the wedding now, and I think we've grown closer through this process. I believe we just had a misunderstanding based on our different cultural backgrounds and what we each value in a wedding. 

So, AITA for wanting a more traditional wedding when my partner prefers minimalism? I think we found a middle ground, but I want to know if my concerns were valid or if I overstepped.",851,2944,0.79,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_81558,2024-11-02 00:00:00,NAH,1859,AITA

Sarah has always been an independent person, and she usually doesn’t like to ask for help. But after several months of job hunting and feeling increasingly overwhelmed, she finally opened up to me about her financial situation. I offered to help her out by covering her rent for a month, which she initially rejected. However, after some back-and-forth, she agreed but insisted on paying me back as soon as she could. I told her it wasn’t necessary, but she was adamant.

A few days later, I invited her over for dinner to cheer her up. I made her favorite meal and we had a great time talking and laughing. During dinner, I jokingly mentioned that I had also been trying to cook more often to save money, and I shared a few cooking tips. Sarah expressed interest in learning some recipes, so I offered to help her make meals for the week to save her some time and money.

He shared that he had been feeling really overwhelmed with work and personal life, and he was dealing with some anxiety that he hadn’t previously talked about. 

We spent hours talking about our experiences and supporting each other, and I encouraged him to seek professional help if he felt it would be beneficial. After that night, I noticed a change in Alex; he seemed a bit lighter and more at ease. I was hopeful that he would take steps to address his mental health.

A few weeks later, I received a call from his sister, who was worried because Alex had been acting distant and withdrawn. She mentioned that he had stopped responding to her texts and seemed to be isolating himself again. I felt a pit in my stomach hearing this, as I had seen how hard he was trying just weeks before.

I decided to reach out to him, but I didn’t want to pressure him. I sent a simple message just letting him know I was there for him, no matter what. He finally replied a couple of days later, and we made plans to hang out again. When we got together, he admitted that he had been struggling more than he had let on and that he was embarrassed about it.

I listened, offered support, and shared my own experiences with anxiety and how I had worked through it. I assured him that it was okay to seek help and that he wasn’t alone in this. I also mentioned how I was glad we had that deep conversation a few months back because it showed me how strong he really is, even when he feels weak.

As he started to open up more, he revealed that he had been hesitant to tell anyone about his struggles because he thought it would worry them. I reassured him that sharing would only strengthen our friendship and help him feel less alone.

While I felt like I had done my best to support him, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I could have done more. I had questions about how to help him navigate this tough time, but I didn’t want to overwhelm him. I respected his pace and promised to be there for him, whatever he needed.

Ultimately, I hope he continues to seek help and that our friendship can remain a safe space for both of us to talk about our struggles without fear of judgment. 

TL;DR: My best friend opened up about his struggles with anxiety. I supported him, but I worry I could have done more. He has since withdrawn again, and I'm trying to be there for him without pressuring him.",464,895,0.67,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_34670,2019-07-17 00:00:00,NAH,2649,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My sister is currently navigating a pretty serious phase in her life. She recently got out of a long-term relationship and is trying to figure out her next steps, both emotionally and professionally. I’ve been trying to support her as best as I can, offering to listen whenever she wants to talk and inviting her out to do things to help take her mind off everything.

A few weeks ago, I invited her to a small gathering with some close friends, thinking it would be a good environment for her to relax and have some fun. I mentioned that one of our friends, who is a bit of a jokester, would be there. I thought she could use a laugh. 

At the gathering, things were going well until our friend jokingly teased her about her breakup. He didn't mean any harm, but he has a tendency to push things too far when he thinks he's being funny. My sister got visibly upset and I could see her mood change in an instant. I felt torn because I didn’t want to ruin the fun for everyone else, but I also didn’t want my sister to feel like she had to endure that kind of joking. 

I decided to step in gently and tell our friend to ease off a bit, explaining that my sister was having a tough time. He apologized, and while the mood was a bit awkward for a moment, we all moved on. However, my sister later told me that she appreciated me stepping in, but she also felt embarrassed that I had to do that. She didn’t want to be the center of attention for the wrong reasons. 

I’m just worried about balancing my desire to protect my sister’s feelings with the need to keep things light and fun for everyone. I also don’t want to create unnecessary tension between my sister and our friend, who didn’t mean any harm. 

So, did I overstep by intervening, or was it the right thing to do?

No one is the Asshole,"I’ve been feeling really conflicted about a situation that happened recently with my close friends, and I just need some outside perspective. 

Last weekend, I hosted a small dinner party at my apartment, inviting a few friends over to catch up and enjoy some good food. I had been planning this for a while and was really looking forward to it. I spent the whole day preparing, cooking, and setting up the place. I wanted it to be a special evening.

One of my friends, Sarah, has been going through a tough time lately. She recently lost her job and has been feeling pretty down about it. I wanted to make sure she felt included and supported, so I reached out to her a couple days before the dinner to encourage her to come and let her know I was thinking of her.

When the evening came, Sarah arrived visibly upset. I asked her if everything was okay, and she opened up about her struggles. I could tell she was in a really sensitive place, so I did my best to listen and be supportive. However, I also wanted to keep the atmosphere light for the other guests.

During dinner, I tried to gently steer the conversation towards more positive topics, but Sarah kept bringing the focus back to her problems. I could see that some of the other guests were starting to feel uncomfortable, and I was worried that the evening would turn into a therapy session rather than a fun get-together. 

At one point, I kindly suggested that maybe we could talk about something else for a while, just to lighten the mood. I said something like, “I really want everyone to enjoy the night, and we can definitely talk more about this later if you want.” She seemed to take this quite poorly and got upset, saying I was dismissing her feelings. 

In the end, Sarah decided to leave early, and I felt terrible. I never intended to hurt her feelings; I just wanted to create an enjoyable atmosphere for everyone. The rest of the night was a bit awkward without her, and I’ve been feeling guilty ever since.

So, AITA for trying to shift the conversation at my dinner party? I genuinely wanted to support Sarah, but I also wanted to keep the evening enjoyable for everyone else.",234,2138,0.96,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_97979,2018-09-07 00:00:00,NAH,2158,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I (16F) have a complicated relationship with my mom and my stepdad. My mom married my stepdad when I was 8, and while he’s always been nice to me, I never really bonded with him. They had two kids together, and I sometimes feel like the odd one out in the family.

A few months ago, my mom and stepdad decided to take a family trip to the beach, and they invited me along. I was hesitant at first because I hadn’t been feeling very close to them, but I didn’t want to ruin their fun. I agreed to go, mostly to avoid drama.

The trip started off okay, but I found myself feeling really disconnected. My stepdad kept joking around with my younger siblings, and I felt like I was just there in the background. One night, they were all laughing and playing games while I sat alone in my room. I decided to go for a walk on the beach to clear my head.

While I was walking, I bumped into a family that we used to vacation with when I was younger. They remembered me and invited me to join them for a bonfire. I felt so much more comfortable with them, reminiscing about old times and feeling like I belonged. I ended up staying with them for the rest of the night.

The next day, my mom and stepdad were furious when I came back late. They said I had disrespected the family by leaving them and that I should have been with them instead of hanging out with people from my past. I tried to explain how I felt and that I just needed a break but ended up getting into a heated argument.

In the end, my mom was upset with me for not prioritizing our family trip, and I felt guilty for hurting her feelings. I didn't mean to cause a rift, but I also wanted to enjoy my time and feel like I belonged somewhere. I’m feeling conflicted about whether I should have just sucked it up and stayed with them or if it was okay for me to seek comfort elsewhere.

No one is the Asshole,"Throwaway for anonymity.

I recently went through a tough situation involving my extended family. My aunt, who has always been like a second mother to me, was diagnosed with a serious illness. While my immediate family and I were supportive, my cousin, her daughter, became overwhelmed with the situation and started to distance herself from the family. 

As my aunt's condition worsened, it became clear that she wanted to have a family gathering to say our goodbyes. My cousin, feeling burdened, asked for help planning the gathering. I offered to coordinate logistics like food and invitations, as I could see how stressed she was. However, I also made it clear that I wanted to keep it small and intimate, as my aunt preferred that over a large gathering.

As we planned, my cousin insisted on inviting a much larger group, including people my aunt hadn't seen in years. I expressed my feelings, saying I thought it would overwhelm my aunt and that we should focus on her comfort. She didn’t take this well and accused me of trying to take control and not caring about her feelings. I felt bad, but I was also concerned about my aunt's well-being.

In the end, we decided to compromise by inviting a few more people than I was originally comfortable with, but I made it clear that the focus should remain on my aunt. The gathering turned out to be a beautiful farewell, and my aunt was genuinely happy to see everyone, including those she hadn't seen in a long time.

Afterward, my cousin and I had a heartfelt conversation about our feelings during that time. We both admitted we were struggling, just in different ways. I realized she was just trying to manage her own emotions while I was trying to think about my aunt’s needs. It helped us reconnect and strengthen our bond.

No one is the Asshole,"Throwaway account because my friends know my main one.

So, I have this friend, Jake, who is a huge movie buff. He loves sharing his thoughts about films, and we often have lengthy discussions about our favorites. We're both pretty passionate about cinema, and while we have a lot in common, we also have our fair share of differing opinions.

Recently, Jake invited me over for a movie night, and he was really excited to show me a film he had been raving about for weeks. He told me it was a classic and that I absolutely had to see it. I trust his taste, so I was looking forward to it.

When I arrived, he had a whole spread of snacks and drinks, which was awesome. We sat down to watch the movie, and about twenty minutes in, I realized it wasn’t really my cup of tea. The pacing was slow, and I found myself losing interest. I tried to stay engaged, but I just couldn’t get into it.

After a while, I guess I was a bit too vocal about my thoughts. I made a couple of comments like, “This is a bit dull,” and “I didn’t expect it to be so slow,” which I thought were light-hearted critiques. Jake, on the other hand, seemed to take it to heart. He really loved this movie and was visibly disappointed that I wasn’t enjoying it. 

At one point, he paused the film and said, “Hey, can we not talk about how much you’re not enjoying this? I really wanted to share this with you.” I felt bad because I didn’t mean to ruin his night. I ended up apologizing and suggested we put on something else that we both like. He agreed, and we ended up watching a comedy that we both love, which was a hit.

Afterward, I felt a bit conflicted. I didn’t mean to hurt his feelings, but I also wanted to be honest about my views. I spoke with another friend about it, and they mentioned that it’s important to express your opinion, but I should also consider how it affects others.

So, AITA for expressing my thoughts on the movie? I genuinely didn’t mean to upset Jake, and I thought honesty was the best policy, but I also don’t want to come off as an inconsiderate jerk.",661,2913,0.74,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_55499,2018-06-03 00:00:00,NAH,2059,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I (F24) recently moved to a new city for work, and while I was excited about the change, I’ve also been feeling a bit lonely since I don’t know many people here. A couple of weeks ago, I met a coworker (M26) at a team event, and we hit it off. He’s really nice, and we’ve been hanging out a bit outside of work and texting regularly. 

During one of our conversations, he opened up about how he had a tough upbringing and mentioned that he doesn’t have a close relationship with his family. I empathized with him since I also have my own family issues, and we bonded over that. However, I also sensed that he might be relying on me a bit too much for emotional support, and it started to feel overwhelming.

I ended up telling him that while I really enjoy our friendship, I’m not in a place to be someone’s emotional crutch. I suggested that he might want to consider talking to a professional to help him work through some of his feelings. He seemed a bit taken aback and said he appreciated my honesty but felt hurt that I would suggest he needed therapy, as he viewed it as a sign that he was weak or that I didn’t care.

Now, I'm feeling conflicted. I didn’t mean to hurt his feelings; I genuinely wanted to help him in a way that’s healthy for both of us. I’ve been thinking about it a lot, and I’m unsure if I was out of line for suggesting he seek professional help.

No one is the Asshole,"My best friend recently started a small bakery business after leaving her corporate job. She's incredibly talented and passionate about baking, and I'm really proud of her for taking the leap to pursue her dream. However, since she opened her bakery, I’ve noticed that some of our mutual friends have started to treat her like a free resource for baked goods.

At first, it was just a request here and there for a small treat, which she was happy to provide. But now, it seems like every time we hang out, someone is asking for cakes, cookies, or pastries, often without any intention to pay or even offer to contribute ingredients. I can see it’s becoming overwhelming for her, and I know she’s stressed about managing her business, especially since it’s still in the early stages.

I brought it up to her one day, suggesting that she might want to set some boundaries and maybe even charge friends for larger orders. I emphasized that it's important for her to value her work and time, and that it's okay to say no to requests if they feel excessive. She appreciated my concern but expressed that she feels guilty about charging her friends, fearing it might create tension or that they would think she's just in it for the money.

I want to support her, but I’m also worried that if she keeps giving away her products for free, it might hurt her business in the long run. I thought about mentioning something to our friends in a lighthearted way, like, “Hey, we should support [Friend's Name]'s bakery – let’s buy some treats instead of just asking for them!”

No one is the Asshole,"I (F29) recently went through a difficult breakup with my long-term boyfriend (M30). We had been together for almost five years, but over the last year, it became clear that we were growing in different directions. We had a lot of discussions about our future, and while we tried to work through our differences, it became evident that we were not compatible anymore. It was a mutual decision to end things, but it was still heartbreaking.

After our breakup, I found myself in a weird social situation. I have a close group of friends, and we often hang out together. Some of them were supportive and understanding about the breakup, but a few not-so-close friends kept asking me about what happened, and I found it challenging to explain the situation without going into too much detail. 

I often told them that we simply grew apart and that we both wanted different things in life. However, there was one friend (F28) who kept pressing for more information, clearly wanting to know if there was some dramatic incident that caused the split. I felt uncomfortable divulging too much, as I didn't want to air my personal issues or make my ex look bad.

One day at a gathering, when the topic of relationships came up, she decided to share her thoughts on breakups, and I could see she was hinting at wanting me to share the “juicy” details of mine. I politely shared that it was a mutual decision and that we still respect each other, but she kept pushing, saying, “Come on, there must be more to it!” I felt cornered, and while I was trying to maintain a calm demeanor, I finally said something like, “Honestly, it’s not that dramatic; I just think we were not meant to be together anymore.” 

Afterward, I overheard her talking to another friend, suggesting that I was being “too private” and that I should just tell people the whole story if I wanted support. I felt frustrated because I was trying to handle a tough situation in my own way, and I didn’t think I owed anyone a detailed account of my breakup. I ended up bringing this up with her later, explaining that I appreciated her concern but that I just wanted to keep things low-key right now.

I wanted to support her and spend some quality time together, so I invited her over for a movie night at our place.

I told my partner about it and he was fine with it, but as the day approached, he mentioned that he had been hoping to spend some quality time with me that weekend too. He suggested we do something together, just the two of us, since he felt we hadn’t had enough of that lately. I understood his point, but I really felt that my friend needed me right now.

They mentioned that while they appreciated the humor, the joke hit a little too close to home and made them feel awkward. I completely understood and assured them that it was okay to feel that way.

I then thought it might be helpful to address this with my friend, but I didn’t want to create tension or make them feel bad for a harmless joke.

My next-door neighbor, who is an avid gardener himself, came over to chat one day while I was working in my garden. He seemed genuinely impressed with my progress and offered me some tips based on his experience, which I appreciated. However, he also mentioned that he had a few rare plants he could share with me if I was interested. I was excited and said I’d love to see them.

A couple of days later, he brought over a couple of his prized plants, which were indeed beautiful. He told me how to care for them and offered some great advice. However, I noticed that he also seemed a bit possessive about his gardening knowledge, often correcting me on small things and suggesting that I should stick to ""beginner plants"" for now. I didn’t take it too personally; I figured he was just trying to help.

As I continued to work on my garden, I started to experiment more and even planted a few things that were a bit more challenging. I shared my progress on social media, and my neighbor saw the posts. He commented on one of my photos, saying, ""You should really stick to what you know; those plants might be too much for you."" I felt a little stung by that comment because I was proud of what I had accomplished.

I realized that my comments may have come off as dismissive of their efforts, and I quickly apologized, saying I didn’t mean to put pressure on them. The rest of the picnic went well, but I felt bad for not being more sensitive to Jamie's feelings.

As we discussed the guest list, I suggested inviting one of my friends who tends to be a bit loud and opinionated, and my partner expressed his discomfort with that idea.

He explained that he thought my friend could dominate the conversation and potentially make others feel uncomfortable. I understood his perspective and didn’t want to put him in a situation where he felt anxious about the gathering. We talked it through, and I agreed to leave my friend off the guest list this time.

However, I felt a bit guilty because I didn’t want to dismiss my friend's inclusion simply because it made my partner uneasy. After some more discussion, we decided to compromise: we would invite my friend but also set some ground rules for the evening to ensure that everyone felt included in the conversation. My partner felt more comfortable with that, and I was happy to have my friend there.

In the end, the dinner went really well. My friend was lively yet respectful, and we all had a great time. My partner even mentioned that he appreciated that we could communicate and find a solution together without hard feelings. We both learned a bit about each other's boundaries and how to navigate them, which ultimately strengthened our relationship. 

So, I think we handled it well together, balancing both our needs and perspectives.",692,908,0.56,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_21329,2019-09-02 00:00:00,NAH,1540,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Good morning everyone, I’m in a bit of a funny situation and I’m curious about your thoughts.

So, my partner and I have been together for a few years, and we recently decided to start cooking together more often. We both enjoy trying new recipes and experimenting in the kitchen. However, there’s one little quirk about my partner: they are incredibly particular about how ingredients should be prepped. Like, to the point where they have a specific technique for chopping onions that they think is the only correct way to do it.

The other night, we decided to make a stir-fry, and I was excited to contribute. I started chopping the vegetables, including the onions, but I used my own method – which is much quicker and not as precise as theirs. When my partner came into the kitchen, they saw what I was doing and immediately got very flustered. They said, “That’s not how you chop an onion; you’re doing it all wrong!” 

I tried to explain that it was just my way of doing it, and it still gets the job done, but they insisted on taking over. I didn’t want to start a fight, so I stepped back and let them do it. However, I could tell they were still annoyed, and it made the whole cooking experience a bit tense.

After we finished cooking, we sat down to eat, and while the meal turned out great, I could see that my partner was still a bit miffed about the onion situation. We ended up laughing it off later, but I still feel a bit guilty for not just conforming to their method. 

So, am I the asshole for not following my partner’s way of prepping the onions, or was it just a funny little spat that happens in relationships?",668,2652,0.73,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_95954,2024-08-18 00:00:00,NAH,1635,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"A few weeks ago, my friend Sarah invited me to a small gathering at her place to celebrate her birthday. She mentioned that she was planning to make a big dinner, and I offered to bring dessert to help out. Sarah has always been a great host, and I wanted to contribute in a meaningful way.

I decided to bake a cake from scratch and spent the entire day preparing it. I made a rich chocolate cake with homemade frosting, and I was really proud of how it turned out. However, when I arrived at the party, I noticed that Sarah's cousin, Emily, had brought a store-bought cake as well.

As the night went on, people started to eat both cakes. Emily seemed a bit upset that her cake wasn't getting as much attention as mine. I could see her trying to engage the guests and get them to try her cake, but most people were raving about mine. I felt bad for her, so I made an effort to encourage everyone to try both cakes.

At one point, I even said loudly, “Don’t forget to try Emily’s cake! It looks delicious too!” I wanted her to feel included and appreciated. However, I noticed that instead of lightening the mood, it seemed to make her more uncomfortable. She eventually left the party early, looking upset.

Afterward, Sarah told me that Emily had been feeling insecure about her baking skills and that my cake overshadowed hers. I didn’t intend for that to happen, and I felt terrible that my efforts ended up hurting someone else’s feelings.

No one is the Asshole,"I know the title sounds confusing, but please hear me out.

My sister, Mia, is 26 and has always been passionate about her art. She graduated with a degree in Fine Arts and has been working hard to establish herself as an artist. I admire her dedication and have always supported her dreams, even when times were tough.

Recently, Mia got an opportunity to showcase her work at a local gallery. She was over the moon and spent weeks preparing for the exhibition. I was thrilled for her and wanted to do something special to celebrate this milestone. However, I also had my own big event coming up: my wedding, which is happening in a couple of months.

The week before Mia’s exhibition, I asked her if she would be comfortable helping me with some DIY decorations for my wedding. I wanted her to create a few pieces that could blend her art with our wedding theme. I thought it would be a great way for us to spend time together and for her to have a little fun while still working on her art.

Mia was really busy finalizing her pieces for the gallery and told me she couldn’t take on any extra projects. I completely understood and told her not to worry about it. I figured I could manage on my own, but I still felt a bit disappointed because I really wanted her to be a part of my special day.

On the day of her exhibition, I attended and was so proud of her. She had done an amazing job, and everyone loved her work. However, during the event, some of our family members kept asking me about my wedding plans, and I mentioned that I wished she could have helped with some decorations. I didn’t mean to downplay her achievement, but I think the timing of my comment was off.

After the exhibition, Mia approached me and expressed that she felt hurt by my comment. She thought I was overshadowing her moment with my wedding talk, which had been the last thing she wanted to think about during her big night. I felt awful and assured her that I was genuinely happy for her, but I guess I was just trying to share my life updates as well.

I recently started a new job that demands a lot of my time, and on top of that, I've been going through some mental health struggles that make it hard for me to keep up with social events and responsibilities. I told her that while I would love to support her, I couldn't promise to organize the bachelorette party or help with all the planning for the wedding like a typical maid of honor would.

She was a bit taken aback but seemed to understand, and I suggested she consider asking someone who would be able to fully engage in the role. I even recommended a mutual friend who is more available and eager to help. My friend said she appreciated my honesty but still wanted me to be part of the day, even if I couldn’t fulfill all the traditional duties.

A few days later, I heard from some mutual friends that she was upset with me and felt like I was backing out on her and our friendship. They told me I should just suck it up and take on the maid of honor role, as it means a lot to her. I felt torn because I want to support her but also need to take care of my mental health.

I reached out to her to clarify my feelings, and we ended up having a heartfelt conversation. She expressed that she just wanted me there for her, and she didn't need me to be the perfect maid of honor, but I still felt bad about not being able to contribute as much as she hoped.

During the reception, I noticed that one of my friends, Sarah, seemed to be a little out of sorts. She wasn’t dancing much and looked a bit down. I approached her to check in and see if everything was okay. She opened up about some recent struggles she was facing, including feeling overwhelmed with work and some personal issues.

I tried to offer her support and reminded her that she could always reach out if she needed someone to talk to. We ended up chatting for a while, which was nice, but I also noticed that my other friends were starting to miss me on the dance floor. I felt torn between wanting to be there for Sarah and wanting to enjoy the celebration with my other friends.

Eventually, I decided to excuse myself and go back to dancing, but I made sure to let Sarah know that I was there for her if she needed to talk more later. I thought I handled it well, balancing my time between supporting a friend and not abandoning the festivities entirely.

Later, however, I overheard some friends talking about how I had “abandoned” Sarah when she was clearly upset and needed support. I felt a little hurt by this because I genuinely tried to be a good friend and didn’t want to neglect anyone.

He’s been open about his anxiety and depression, and I’ve tried my best to be there for him. We've had a lot of deep conversations, and I really care about him, but sometimes I feel a little out of my depth with how to support him.

Recently, he started talking about wanting to get back into dating, which I think is a great step for him. However, he seemed really unsure, and I wanted to encourage him, so I jokingly said something like, “You should just go for it! You’d be a catch even if you wore a clown suit!” I thought it would lighten the mood.

Instead, he got really quiet and then said, “I don’t think I can really do that right now.” I immediately realized that my comment might have come off as dismissive of his feelings and struggles. I apologized and told him I was just trying to be funny and supportive, but I could see it didn’t land that way. 

He thanked me for my concern but told me he just didn’t want to feel pressured or like I was making light of his situation. I felt awful and assured him that I would be more sensitive in the future. We ended up having a really good conversation about how he feels about dating and what he needs from me as a friend.

In the end, I think we both learned something: he learned to communicate more about his feelings, and I learned to be more mindful of my words.

Last Saturday, my friend group decided to throw a surprise birthday party for one of our close friends. It was a pretty big deal since we wanted to make it special for him. We all chipped in to buy decorations, food, and drinks, and I was in charge of setting up the music playlist. 

The day of the party, I was busy getting everything organized at a friend’s house. We had a decent number of people coming, and I was excited to see everyone. While I was setting up, I noticed that one of our friends, Sarah, was looking a bit down. She’s someone who usually brings a lot of energy to gatherings, so it stood out to me.

I approached her and asked if she was okay. She opened up about feeling a bit left out lately, as she had just gone through a rough breakup and hadn't been feeling social. I tried to reassure her and invited her to help with the setup for the party so she could feel more included. She seemed to appreciate the gesture, and we ended up chatting and laughing as we worked together.

As the party began, I noticed that Sarah was still a bit withdrawn. The birthday boy arrived, and everyone was excited, but Sarah didn’t seem to be enjoying herself as much as the rest of us. I went over to check in with her again, and she mentioned that she was feeling overwhelmed by all the socializing. 

I suggested that if she wanted to step outside for a bit to get some fresh air, I could join her so we could chat. She agreed, and we took a break from the party. While we were outside, I encouraged her to talk about how she was feeling and reassured her that it was okay to take time for herself.

After a little while, we headed back inside. Sarah seemed a bit more relaxed, but I noticed she had been avoiding interacting with our other friends. As the night went on, the vibe was great, and we all had a lot of fun. However, it became apparent that Sarah was still feeling a bit out of place.

After the party, some of our friends mentioned to me that they noticed Sarah wasn't herself and wondered if I had spoken to her. I shared how I had tried to include her and support her during the party, but that I felt a bit helpless to make her feel fully included. 

I later found out that a couple of our friends felt I should have focused more on the birthday celebration itself rather than trying to help Sarah. They thought it might have taken away from the party’s energy. I feel like I acted with good intentions, but I also understand that the surprise party was for our friend, and I didn’t want to overshadow that.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I’m a volunteer coach for a youth soccer team made up of 10-year-olds. Everything was going well until we had a new kid join the team named Jason. He’s a decent player but has a habit of being overly competitive and often puts down his teammates when they make mistakes. 

For example, during practice last week, one of the kids missed a goal, and Jason shouted, “You’ll never make it in the big leagues if you keep playing like that!” This happened multiple times, and it started to affect the team’s morale. Some of the kids would visibly shrink back after he said things like that, and I could see that they were beginning to dread practice.

I decided to address the issue by pulling Jason aside after one of the practices. I explained that while it’s great to be competitive, it’s really important to encourage each other and be supportive as a team. I wanted him to understand that building his teammates up would make the whole team stronger.

Jason seemed to take it well, but later, during a game, he started criticizing his teammates again in front of everyone. In the heat of the moment, I yelled at him to “cut it out!” in front of the whole team, which I felt was necessary to make my point. However, I noticed he got really upset and ended up sitting by himself on the bench for the rest of the game.

Afterward, I felt conflicted. I didn’t want to embarrass him, but at the same time, I was trying to foster a positive environment for the other kids. I think my intentions were good, but I’m not sure if I handled it the right way.

We picked a weekend in early October and invited all our relatives, including our parents, cousins, aunts, and uncles. 

While planning the reunion, I remembered that my partner's birthday falls on the same weekend. We usually do something special for her birthday, but since the family reunion is a big event, I thought I could combine the two. I suggested to my sister that we celebrate my partner's birthday during the reunion, as it would give everyone a chance to meet her and celebrate together.

My sister was initially enthusiastic about the idea, but then she expressed some reservations. She felt that making my partner's birthday a part of the anniversary celebration might overshadow our parents' milestone and take away from the focus of the day. I understand her perspective, but I also thought it could work well if we made it clear that the anniversary celebration was the main event, and we could just have a small cake and a toast for my partner afterward.

We had a long conversation about it, and I could see that we both had good intentions. I didn’t want to be selfish or take the spotlight from my parents, but I also wanted to honor my partner's special day in a way that felt inclusive. Ultimately, we decided to keep the focus on our parents and have a separate celebration for my partner the following weekend.

I felt a bit torn because I wanted to celebrate both occasions together, but I also didn’t want to create any tension within the family. I appreciate that my sister was open about her feelings, and I’m glad we were able to compromise.

Sarah insisted that she wanted me to be the one, and I didn’t want to hurt her feelings, but I also wanted to be honest about my limits.

One band member, Jake, is especially talented and is a fantastic singer. He is also a really outgoing person who loves to entertain and get everyone involved. However, he can be a little pushy when it comes to his ideas, often insisting that we play songs he wants to cover, even if the rest of us aren’t really into them. Whenever we tried to suggest alternatives, he would dismiss them or say we should just trust him.

One day, during practice, I suggested we try a song that I had written. I was nervous but excited to share it. When I played it for the group, Jake immediately interrupted, saying it was “too slow” and “wouldn’t work for our vibe.” I felt deflated, and so did the other members, who were supportive of my idea. After a bit of back-and-forth, I finally said, “Look, I really think it’s a good song, and it would be nice if we could give it a chance.”

Jake didn’t take it well and accused me of being uncooperative. This led to a heated argument, and eventually, the practice ended with everyone feeling awkward and upset. I felt bad about the confrontation but also felt that I had a right to stand up for my music.

I was at a local coffee shop, working on some freelance projects. It was a busy Saturday morning, and the café was packed. There was a long line, and people were trying to find seats while waiting for their orders. I noticed a young mother with her toddler at a table nearby. The toddler was getting a bit restless, and the mother was doing her best to keep him entertained while waiting for their drinks.

At one point, the little boy started to get louder, and the mother looked quite stressed trying to manage him. I understood that she was juggling a lot, and it was tough in a crowded space. The boy started to throw a small tantrum, which was starting to draw the attention of some nearby customers.

Feeling empathetic, I decided to do something to help. I went over to their table and said to the boy, “Hey buddy, would you like to see some magic?” He stopped crying, intrigued by the idea. I pulled a small coin out of my pocket and did a quick magic trick, making it disappear and reappear. The boy giggled, and the mother looked relieved. 

After a couple of minutes of fun, the barista called their order, and the mother thanked me sincerely. I felt good about helping them in that moment, but later, I overheard a few customers at another table who were discussing how I was “acting like a clown” and “drawing attention away from the baristas.”

I tried to explain that I was only trying to support her and that I understood if she wasn’t ready to take on more work. But the conversation ended up escalating into an argument, and we both said some hurtful things. She accused me of not understanding her struggles, and I told her I felt frustrated that she wasn’t willing to explore possible solutions. 

After our argument, I reached out to apologize and told her that I didn't want to make her feel pressured. She accepted my apology, but I could tell she was still upset. 

Now I’m wondering if I should have just kept my suggestions to myself and let her handle her situation in her own way? AITA for trying to offer my advice when she clearly wasn’t ready for it?",467,1445,0.78,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_42013,2020-12-30 00:00:00,NAH,1793,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I (28M) have a close friend, Sarah (27F), who has been going through a tough time lately. She recently broke up with her long-term boyfriend, and as her friend, I've been doing my best to support her. We’ve been hanging out more often, going for walks, watching movies, and just talking about life. 

One evening, we decided to have a movie marathon at my place. I made some popcorn, and we settled in on the couch. We were joking around, and at one point, we got a little silly and started playfully wrestling over a blanket. It was all in good fun; we were laughing and enjoying each other's company.

As the night went on, we ended up cuddling on the couch while watching a romantic movie. At one point, I leaned in and kissed her softly. To my surprise, she kissed me back. After that, we shared a few more kisses, which felt really nice, and I thought maybe there was something more between us.

However, after a while, Sarah pulled away and said, “I’m not sure this is a good idea.” I immediately felt embarrassed and tried to play it off, saying it was just a friendly kiss and that we could forget about it. But she looked a bit upset, and I realized I might have crossed a line.

We talked about it, and I assured her that I never meant to make her uncomfortable. She explained that she wasn’t ready to start dating again so soon after her breakup, and she valued our friendship too much to risk complicating things. I completely understood and told her I didn’t want to pressure her into anything.

We agreed to take a step back and just focus on being friends for now, but it felt awkward for a few days afterward. I wanted to check in with her to make sure she was okay and to let her know that I respected her feelings. Thankfully, she assured me that she was fine and appreciated how I handled the situation.

In the end, we both decided that our friendship was important, and we could still support each other through tough times. I feel a bit confused about whether I did something wrong or if it was just an unexpected moment. I genuinely care about her and want to do what's best for our friendship. 

So, Reddit, AITA for kissing my friend when she’s going through a tough time, or was it just an innocent moment that we both misinterpreted?",508,2089,0.55,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_60827,2020-07-01 00:00:00,NAH,2260,AITA

She’s been really vocal about her journey on social media, which is fine, but it’s been a bit intense. I’ve noticed that she often criticizes others for their food choices, including mine. 

The other day, we went out to lunch with a group of friends. I ordered a burger and fries, and Sarah made a comment about how unhealthy that was and how she wouldn’t even look at a burger anymore. I felt a bit embarrassed and defensive, but I shrugged it off and tried to change the subject. Later, I sent her a message expressing that while I support her choices, I felt uncomfortable with her comments. I didn’t want her to think I was judging her for her choices, and I asked if she could be a bit more mindful of her words around others.

She responded positively and said she didn’t mean to make anyone uncomfortable, but she also admitted that she’s really passionate about her new lifestyle. We ended up having a good conversation about balance and how we can support each other without criticism.

No one is the Asshole,"For my recent birthday, my friends decided to throw me a surprise party, which I had no idea about. They really went all out with decorations, food, and even hired a local band to play. It was a fantastic night filled with laughter and joy. 

However, there was a bit of an unexpected twist. One of my closest friends, Sarah, brought her young daughter, Emma, who is about 5 years old. Emma is a sweet kid, but she has a tendency to be quite loud and energetic, which can sometimes be a little overwhelming for me and other guests, especially in a small space. 

At one point during the party, the band started playing one of my favorite songs, and I got really excited. I jumped up to dance, and in that moment, Emma also started dancing around me, which was adorable. But then, in her enthusiasm, she accidentally bumped into me and knocked over my drink. It spilled all over my favorite shirt, which I had been looking forward to wearing to the party.

I was surprised and a bit frustrated, but I tried to keep my cool. I told Emma it was okay and reassured her that accidents happen. Sarah came over to apologize and offered to help clean it up. I smiled and said it was fine, but deep down, I felt a little upset about my shirt and the mess.

As the night went on, I tried to brush it off, but every time I caught a glimpse of the stain, it brought back my annoyance. When the party wrapped up, I mentioned to Sarah that I was a little bummed about my shirt. She immediately offered to replace it, which I appreciated, but I declined, saying it was just a shirt and I didn’t want her to feel obligated.

Now I’m wondering if I should have been more understanding or if it was okay to feel a little upset about the incident. I don’t want to hold a grudge against Emma, but I also wish the night had gone without any mishaps.

My partner was really excited and wanted to go, but I was feeling overwhelmed with work and personal commitments. I'd been working long hours and felt like I needed some downtime to recharge.

When my partner asked if I would come along, I hesitated. I said that I would love to support her sister and the new baby but needed to skip this gathering for my mental health. My partner seemed disappointed, and I could tell she was struggling with the idea of attending without me. We ended up having a discussion about it, where I expressed my feelings honestly. I wanted her to be able to enjoy the celebration and feel supported without me imposing on her fun.

In the end, she decided to go without me, and I encouraged her to have a great time. She ended up enjoying herself and came back home with a lot of stories and photos, which made me happy. However, I still felt a bit guilty for not being there, and I worried that I was letting her down.

My sister and I are pretty close, but we have different parenting styles. She has two kids, and I have one. I believe in letting kids explore their creativity and make some messes, while she prefers a more structured environment. A few weeks ago, I offered to watch her kids for a day so she could have some time to herself. I was excited to spend time with them and do some fun activities.

I set up a little art station in my living room with paints, markers, and canvases. I thought it would be a fun way for them to express themselves. My niece, who’s 8, loved it and dove right in, but my nephew, who’s 5, started painting everywhere—on the table, the floor, and even on his clothes. I was supervising, but I guess I got a bit caught up watching how much fun they were having and didn’t step in soon enough.

When my sister came back, she was furious. She was upset about the mess and how I let them do that without putting more restrictions in place. I tried to explain that I thought they were having fun and learning through play, but she wasn’t having it. She felt like I disrespected her parenting choices and put her kids in a situation that was too chaotic.

I do get that she has different rules for her kids, and I didn’t mean to cross any lines, but I honestly thought we were just having a fun day together. I didn't think it was a big deal at the time, and I still feel like I was just trying to create a fun environment.

In the past few months, she’s really fallen for this new guy, and while I'm happy for her, I’ve noticed she’s been a bit different. 

She used to be really open about her feelings and thoughts, but since she started dating him, she seems to be less available and more guarded. I understand that relationships can change dynamics, but it feels like I’m losing my friend. I’ve tried to be supportive and encouraging, but I also feel like I should express how I’m feeling.

Last week, we were hanging out, and I brought up my concerns about how she’s been distant. I told her that I miss our conversations and that it seems like she’s prioritizing her new relationship over our friendship. I didn’t mean to come off as confrontational, but I wanted her to know how I felt. She seemed a bit taken aback and told me that she didn’t realize I was feeling that way. She assured me that her new relationship doesn’t mean she cares less about our friendship, but she also mentioned that she’s just adjusting to this new phase in her life.

I felt bad for bringing it up, but I also think it’s important to communicate when you’re feeling neglected. After our talk, we had a good conversation about balancing relationships and friendships, and she promised to try to make more time for us.

It's been a tough journey, but we’ve all grown closer as a family. I work full-time and try to support them emotionally, but I also need to balance my own life, including my job and my relationship with my partner, Chris (32M).

Recently, Jake started dating a girl named Sarah (18F), and they quickly became serious. Sarah has a good heart, but she also has a difficult home life. I noticed she was spending a lot of time over at our place, and while I didn't mind at first, I started to feel overwhelmed by the extra responsibilities. I was concerned about how this would affect Jake's relationship with us and his focus on school.

After some discussions with Chris, we agreed to talk to Jake about perhaps limiting how often Sarah came over. We wanted to encourage him to maintain his independence and ensure that he wasn’t neglecting his studies or his bond with Lily. So, I sat down with Jake and expressed my concerns gently. I told him that while I care for Sarah and think she’s a great person, I wanted to make sure he was balanced and not losing sight of his goals.

Jake didn’t take it well. He felt like I was trying to control him and that I didn’t trust his judgment. I told him that wasn’t my intention at all; I just wanted what was best for him and wanted him to thrive. He ended up storming off and hasn’t really talked to me since. I feel really bad because I didn’t mean to hurt him, and I was just trying to look out for him.

Later, another volunteer overheard our conversation and pulled me aside, saying I shouldn’t have downplayed Sarah’s feelings. They felt I was dismissing her concerns, and it could discourage her from wanting to help in the future. I honestly didn’t mean to come off that way; I just wanted to encourage her. 

I felt bad that my intentions might have been misunderstood, and I went back to Sarah to clarify what I meant. I told her that I really appreciated her being there and that everyone’s journey in volunteering is unique.

One of my friends, Sarah, had been looking forward to this trip for months, as she had recently lost her job and felt she needed a break to clear her mind.

The day of the hike, we set off early in the morning. The weather was perfect, and the scenery was stunning. However, as we began our ascent, we noticed that Sarah was struggling to keep up. She was visibly out of breath and seemed to be having a hard time with the elevation. We all encouraged her to take it slow and assured her we’d wait for her.

As we reached a particularly challenging section of the trail, Sarah decided she needed to turn back. She expressed her disappointment but felt it was the best decision for her well-being. I can understand that, especially since she wasn't used to hiking like the rest of us. 

While the group was supportive of her decision, I could see she was feeling left out and upset. I suggested to the group that perhaps one of us could accompany her back down so she wouldn’t feel alone. A couple of my friends were hesitant, worried they would miss out on the best views if they left early. However, I felt it was important to show support for Sarah.

Eventually, I volunteered to go back with her. The hike back down was a good chance for us to talk, and I learned more about what she had been going through. I let her know that it was okay to be honest about her abilities and that we would always be there for her. By the time we reached the bottom, we had a great conversation, and she seemed a lot lighter.

In the end, my friends acknowledged my choice to prioritize Sarah’s needs, but some still felt that I should have stayed with them and let Sarah go back alone. I don’t hold any resentment towards them; they were just looking out for their own experience, which I understand.

I suggested that maybe we should limit his role in the wedding or not directly involve him in certain parts, just to avoid any potential conflict. My brother was taken aback and said that it’s his wedding, and he wants his dad to be there fully, despite his flaws.

I'm more of a minimalist and prefer a tidy, decluttered space, while my partner tends to hold onto items that have sentimental value, even if they clutter our living space.

One day, I decided to declutter the living room while my partner was busy with work. I went through some boxes that had been left unopened since we moved in. I found a few items that I thought were unnecessary, like old magazines and some broken items, so I tossed them out. However, I also came across an old video game console and a box of games that my partner had not used in ages. I assumed they were just taking up space, so I put them in the donation pile too.

When my partner discovered what I had done, he was upset. He explained that the console had a lot of memories attached to it, and he was planning to fix it up eventually. I felt bad because I didn't realize how much it meant to him, and I apologized for not consulting him before getting rid of things.

We had a long conversation about our different views on possessions and what they mean to us. I explained my perspective on needing a clean and organized space, and he shared his feelings about sentimentality and the importance of holding onto memories. We both realized that we needed to communicate better about these things moving forward.

In the end, I agreed to be more mindful about decluttering in the future, and he promised to make an effort to keep things tidier and more organized. I genuinely didn't mean to hurt his feelings or dismiss his memories, but I can't help but wonder if I overstepped by getting rid of his things without asking.

So, AITA for decluttering without consulting my partner first?",544,1030,0.8,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_23160,2019-10-02 00:00:00,NAH,1832,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, I’ve been working at my current job for about three years now. It’s a small company, and we’ve all become pretty close, almost like a family. Recently, one of my coworkers, Lisa, got promoted and is leaving our team for a new role. We’re all really happy for her, but it felt bittersweet because she’s been such a big part of our daily lives. 

I thought it would be nice to throw a little farewell gathering for her after work. I asked the team if they wanted to pitch in for snacks and drinks, and everyone was on board. We decided to keep it casual and just have some chips, drinks, and cupcakes. I volunteered to make the cupcakes since I enjoy baking.

Now, here’s where it gets a bit tricky. I wanted to decorate the cupcakes with fun messages like “Congrats!” and “We’ll miss you!” but I also thought it might be humorous to add some light-hearted jabs, like “Good luck, you’ll need it!” or “Don’t forget us little people!” I know Lisa has a good sense of humor, and my team would definitely get the joke. However, I was a bit worried that others outside our team might take it the wrong way.

I ended up asking a few team members for their opinions, and they were split. Some thought it would be a fun idea, while others felt it might come off as unprofessional. I didn’t want to offend anyone or make Lisa feel awkward, so I decided to go for simple decorations with only warm messages.

In the end, we had a lovely farewell gathering for Lisa. Everyone enjoyed the cupcakes, and she was genuinely touched by the gesture. It was a nice way to show our appreciation for her contributions without crossing any lines.

So, AITA for wanting to make some funny cupcakes for a farewell party, or was it the right call to stick with more straightforward messages?",145,1918,0.58,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_60762,2024-06-23 00:00:00,NAH,1769,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Hi everyone, I hope you can help me out with this situation.

Recently, I (28F) found out that my grandmother (78) is having some health issues, and it's becoming increasingly difficult for her to manage on her own. She has always been a significant part of my life, and I deeply care about her. After discussing it with my parents and considering my grandmother's needs, I offered to move in with her for a while to help out. I thought it would be a temporary arrangement, just until she gets back on her feet.

However, my younger brother (24M) has been very vocal about how he feels I’m overstepping by moving in. He believes that our grandmother should handle her own affairs and that I’m enabling her to be dependent on others. He worries that I might end up sacrificing my own life plans or career by putting my grandmother first. I understand where he’s coming from, but I feel a strong sense of responsibility to help her.

We got into a bit of an argument about it, and I tried to explain my perspective, but he was pretty adamant that I shouldn’t move in. I don’t want to create a rift in our family, but I also don’t want to abandon my grandmother when she needs support.

I’ve since decided to move in with her, but I feel guilty about how my brother reacted. I care about his opinions, but I also feel like I’m doing what’s right for my grandmother.

So, AITA for moving in with my grandmother despite my brother's objections? 

Edit: I appreciate all the responses! I understand both sides better now, and I want to emphasize that my brother does care about our grandmother, he just has a different perspective on independence and support. I’ll definitely have a chat with him to express my intentions and see if we can find common ground. Thank you!",322,2584,0.89,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_16688,2018-08-26 00:00:00,NAH,1764,AITA

I felt really concerned and wanted to help him out, so I offered to lend him some money to get back on his feet.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I want to share a situation I found myself in recently, and I hope you’ll hear me out before jumping to conclusions about who’s at fault.

A little while ago, I was invited to my friend Sarah’s birthday party. Sarah and I have been friends for years, and I always look forward to celebrating her special day. This year, she decided to host a big gathering at a restaurant, and I was really excited to go. 

A few days before the party, I found out that my younger sister, who has been struggling with some anxiety issues, had a really tough week and was feeling overwhelmed. I wanted to be there for her, so I told Sarah that I wouldn’t be able to make it to the party because I needed to stay home with my sister. Sarah was really understanding and said she appreciated my support for my sister, but she also expressed how much she was looking forward to seeing me at the party.

On the day of the party, I felt really torn. My sister seemed to be doing a bit better, and I wondered if I should go to the party for at least a little while. I ultimately decided to drop by for a couple of hours to celebrate with Sarah and then return home to my sister. I thought it would be okay since I could support both my sister and still show my friend that I cared about her birthday.

When I arrived at the restaurant, Sarah was thrilled to see me, and we had a great time catching up. However, I also noticed that my sister had started to feel anxious again, so I left the party a little earlier than I had planned to check on her. 

After the party, Sarah texted me, saying that she felt a bit hurt that I didn’t stay longer and that it felt like I chose my sister over her. I could understand why she felt this way, but I also felt like I was balancing my responsibilities. I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings, and I explained my situation to her.

Now I’m wondering if I should have just stayed home entirely or if I did the right thing by trying to juggle both. I care about both my sister and Sarah, and I didn’t want to let either of them down. So, AITA for trying to go to Sarah’s party while also being there for my sister?",111,2577,0.62,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_27356,2021-08-20 00:00:00,NAH,2127,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, a few weeks ago, I was at a local park with my dog, enjoying a beautiful sunny day. My dog is a large breed and tends to get a little rowdy when he sees other dogs. As we were walking, we approached a group of people who were having a picnic. One of the kids in the group noticed my dog and ran over, clearly excited to see him. 

I stopped and let the kid pet my dog, but I could see that the parents were a bit apprehensive about it. They were worried that my dog might be too rough or could jump on the kid. I totally understood their concern, so I kept my dog on a short leash and made sure he was calm. 

After a few minutes, the kid was having a blast, but then the parents called him back over, saying they had to get going. I could see my dog getting a little restless because he wanted to keep playing. In an attempt to give everyone a good experience, I said, ""Hey, if it's okay with you, I can let him off the leash for a moment so he can run around a bit before you leave."" 

They appreciated the offer but politely declined, saying they weren't comfortable with it. I completely respected their decision and thanked them for being cautious. 

As they packed up, I threw a ball for my dog a little further away, allowing him to have some fun while keeping it safe for the family. 

I felt like everyone handled the situation well; the parents were looking out for their child, and I was respectful of their wishes while also trying to give my dog a little freedom.

I (27M) have a friend, Sarah (26F), who is a passionate cook and loves to experiment in the kitchen. She often invites a group of us over for dinner parties where she showcases her latest culinary creations. While I genuinely enjoy her cooking, I've noticed that she tends to get quite stressed when preparing for these gatherings, especially when it comes to accommodating everyone's dietary preferences and restrictions.

I have a gluten intolerance and another friend, Mark (28M), is a vegetarian. Recently, Sarah made a big fuss over planning a dinner for us and asked us to send her our dietary needs well in advance. I tried to reassure her that it was okay to focus on what she loves to cook and not stress too much about accommodating us. I suggested that we could bring our own dishes if it made things easier for her.

When the dinner finally happened, I brought a gluten-free dessert to share, and Mark brought a vegetarian side dish. Sarah seemed overwhelmed and a bit frustrated during the dinner prep when she realized she couldn't serve some of her planned dishes. After dinner, she expressed her annoyance that she felt she had to alter her cooking style for us. I tried to explain that we didn’t want her to feel pressured and just wanted to enjoy the time together. I felt bad for suggesting that we bring our own food, thinking it would help her.

She ended up getting upset and said that she felt like we were putting her in a position to cater to us instead of enjoying the meals she had prepared. It was a bit awkward, and I could tell she was hurt.

Our family has always been close-knit, and my parents have done an amazing job of fostering a loving environment. Recently, my brother has developed a strong interest in gaming and has become quite skilled at it. 

Last weekend, I invited him over to my place for a gaming night. I thought it would be fun to play some co-op games together since he had been talking about it non-stop. During our gaming session, I noticed he was really getting frustrated with a particular game that he usually excels at. I asked him what was wrong, and he admitted that he was feeling pressure because his friends often brag about their high scores, and he wanted to impress them.

I tried to encourage him by reminding him that gaming is about having fun and that his friends probably just enjoy playing with him regardless of scores. We had a good talk about how everyone has off days and that it’s normal. I even shared my own experiences of struggling at times to lighten the mood. 

After a while, he seemed to relax and we continued to play. However, the next day, I got a message from my mom saying that she appreciated my support but felt that I shouldn't have shared my own gaming struggles with him. She thought it might have made him feel more insecure about his own skills, and she didn't want him to think I didn’t believe in his talent.

A few months ago, Mia got a job offer in another city that she really wanted to take. We were all supportive and excited for her, but we also knew it would change the dynamic of our group. Mia assured us that she wanted to stay in touch and visit whenever she could.

Last weekend, Mia came back to visit for the first time since she moved. We planned a big reunion dinner to celebrate her return. Everyone was excited, and I had prepared a special dish that Mia had loved back in college.

On the day of the dinner, I found out that Jake had secretly invited his new girlfriend, whom none of us had met yet. I was surprised because I felt it would be a bit overwhelming for Mia, who was already adjusting to being back after a while. When I asked Jake about it, he brushed it off, saying he wanted to introduce her to the group. 

During the dinner, as we were catching up, I noticed Mia seemed a bit uncomfortable with the new dynamic. The conversation was mostly directed at Jake's girlfriend, and it felt like Mia was being sidelined. After a while, I decided to bring the focus back to Mia by asking her about her new life in the city and her job.

Later on, when Mia and I were alone for a moment, she thanked me for trying to include her in the conversation, but she expressed that she felt like the night had turned into Jake's girlfriend's introduction party rather than a reunion. I agreed and said I would have preferred a smaller gathering just for the original group.

After the dinner, Jake confronted me, saying I was being unfair for trying to make him feel bad about bringing his girlfriend. He felt I was being selfish and not considering his happiness. I told him I understood his excitement but that I felt it was important to prioritize Mia's feelings too.

However, during the party, my aunt brought up the topic of relationships and started asking all of us about our love lives. She turned to me and jokingly asked when I was going to settle down, since I’ve been single for a while. 

I laughed it off and said something light-hearted, but then she kept pushing, saying it was time for me to take dating seriously. I could feel my discomfort rising, especially since I’ve been focusing on my career and personal growth lately. I decided to respond honestly and mentioned that I’m really enjoying my independence and not feeling pressured to be in a relationship right now.

My aunt seemed taken aback, and the mood shifted a bit. She said I was missing out on something special, and I could tell she meant well, but I felt like she was diminishing my choices.

No one is the Asshole,"My partner and I have been together for about five years, and we recently decided to move in together. We both have stable jobs, but there's a noticeable difference in our salaries—he makes significantly more than I do. Before moving in, we discussed how to handle our finances and agreed to split the rent and utilities evenly, which seemed fair at the time.

We also agreed that we would share groceries and household items, but that sometimes led to awkward conversations about who bought what. To avoid misunderstandings, we decided to keep things simple and each take turns paying for groceries. I would cover one week, he would cover the next, and so on. This worked well, until a few months into living together.

One evening, I noticed he was feeling a bit down and asked him what was wrong. He admitted he was stressed about money and felt like he was covering more of our expenses than he had anticipated. I assured him that we were splitting things equally, but I understood where he was coming from since he was contributing more toward the rent simply due to his higher income.

In an effort to ease his concerns, I suggested that we adjust our grocery budget and allocate a specific amount each month that I would contribute. I thought this was a fair compromise, but he seemed to think I was trying to diminish my share of the expenses. We ended up in a heated debate, both feeling a bit misunderstood and defensive.

After a long discussion, we realized that we both want to support each other and that the way we were handling our finances could be improved. We agreed to create a shared budget that would detail our contributions and expenses more clearly, and we also decided to be more open about discussing any financial concerns in the future.

It was a learning experience for both of us, and while we both had moments of frustration, I think we came out stronger and more understanding of each other's perspectives. I just want to make sure that I'm being fair, and I hope he feels the same way.

I thought it was a great idea, and I was really looking forward to it. However, when Jake sent out the invitation, he decided to charge everyone a small fee to help cover his costs for snacks and drinks since he was planning to go all out.

I was a bit taken aback by the idea of charging for a game night, especially since it’s always been a casual and free event at our place. I voiced my concern to Jake privately, expressing that I felt it might put some of our friends off, especially those who might be tight on money. He reassured me that it was just a small amount and that he thought it would help make the night more enjoyable and organized.

I decided to bring it up during our group chat, thinking we could discuss it openly. I suggested that we could rotate hosting without charging, and that would keep things relaxed. A few friends agreed with me, but others supported Jake's idea. It turned into a bit of a debate, and I didn’t want to take over the conversation, so I eventually dropped it.

Additionally, I have a pet that is very territorial, and I’m concerned about how they would react to a new person in the house.

To make matters more complicated, my friend is bringing along her two children, ages 5 and 7. While I care about my friend, I’m unsure about how the kids will fit into my living situation. I don’t have the space for them to play or sleep comfortably, and I fear that the noise and chaos would be overwhelming for both me and my pet.

I told my friend that I could help her find a temporary solution, like local shelters or community programs, but she seems really set on staying with me, even offering to help with groceries and cleaning. I appreciate her willingness to contribute, but I’m still hesitant about the arrangement.

I think we both want what’s best for her, but I’m feeling torn about my own needs and limits. I don’t want to seem unsupportive, but I also don’t want to put myself in a situation that could lead to resentment. Am I wrong for wanting to keep my space just for me, or am I justified in my concerns?",321,910,0.7,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_74257,2024-09-22 00:00:00,NAH,1621,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I (F25) recently had a disagreement with my best friend (F26) that I’m trying to figure out if I handled correctly. 

We’ve been friends for a long time, and we often go on trips together. A few weeks ago, she suggested we go on a weekend getaway to celebrate her birthday, which I was excited about. However, as the date approached, I started feeling overwhelmed with work and personal commitments. I shared my concerns with her, explaining that I might not be able to go because I needed to focus on a big project due soon.

She was really disappointed, which I completely understood, but I also felt bad for putting my own needs first. I offered to plan a fun day out for her after her birthday instead, like a spa day or a nice dinner, but she was still upset and said she just wanted me to be there for her birthday weekend. 

In the end, I decided to prioritize my work and told her I couldn’t make it. I felt torn because I didn’t want to let her down, but at the same time, I needed to take care of my responsibilities. 

I texted her afterward and reassured her that I still wanted to celebrate her. She said she appreciated the gesture but felt hurt that I wouldn’t be there on her special day. 

I’ve been feeling guilty about it, but I also think it was important for me to focus on my work. AITA for prioritizing my responsibilities over my friend’s birthday celebration?",653,905,0.55,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_82376,2021-07-24 00:00:00,NAH,1384,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So here’s the situation. My best friend and I have been close for years, but recently we’ve been having some misunderstandings. We often hang out in a group with some mutual friends, and I’ve noticed that lately, our group conversations tend to revolve around inside jokes and experiences that I wasn’t a part of. It feels like I’m on the outside looking in, and I’ve been struggling to connect.

A couple of weeks ago, we all went out for dinner. During the meal, my friend started talking about a trip they took with another friend, sharing funny stories and memories. I was trying to chime in with related experiences, but I felt like I wasn’t getting a chance to really participate. After a while, I started to feel frustrated, so I excused myself to go to the restroom, but instead, I just stepped outside for a breath of fresh air to cool off.

When I returned, my friend asked if I was okay, and I admitted that I felt a bit left out and overwhelmed. My friend seemed surprised and said they had no idea I felt that way. They assured me it wasn’t intentional but acknowledged that they and the others sometimes forget to include everyone in the conversation.

We ended up talking it out, and I expressed that while I love our group, I sometimes struggle to feel included. My friend apologized and promised to make a better effort to engage everyone moving forward, which I appreciated. 

So, am I the asshole for feeling frustrated and stepping out during dinner? Or was it okay for me to express my feelings?",430,2555,0.52,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_72932,2019-03-05 00:00:00,NAH,1516,AITA

My aunt, who I have a close relationship with, decided to organize a talent show for the family. She asked everyone to prepare something to share, and I chose to sing a song that I had been working on. I was really excited and a bit nervous.

On the day of the reunion, everything was going well until it was my turn to perform. As I started singing, I noticed that my cousin, who I’ve always found a bit disrespectful, started making snide comments and laughing with his friends. It really threw me off, and I could feel my confidence sinking. I tried to ignore them and keep going, but I ended up stumbling over the lyrics.

After my performance, I felt embarrassed, and I heard my aunt trying to defend me, saying that everyone should support each other. I did my best to brush off my cousin's comments, but I later confronted him privately, expressing that his behavior was hurtful and not in the spirit of the family gathering. He apologized, saying he didn’t mean to upset me, but I could tell he was still a bit defensive about it.

In the end, my family had a great time, and I received a lot of positive feedback from other family members about my performance. I felt like I handled the situation as best as I could.

No one is the Asshole,"A few weeks ago, my partner and I decided to host a small dinner party with some friends we hadn’t seen in a while. We were excited to catch up and have a good time. The day before the party, my partner was feeling a bit under the weather but insisted on helping with the preparations. I encouraged them to rest, but they wanted to contribute, so I let them help with a few light tasks.

On the day of the dinner, they still seemed unwell, but we had already invited everyone, and they didn’t want to cancel. I agreed that we could keep it low-key and just focus on the food and conversation. However, as the evening went on, my partner started to feel worse. They were visibly uncomfortable, and I could see they were struggling to keep up the energy.

During the dinner, I noticed that my partner was getting quieter and more reserved. After a while, I gently suggested that they take a break and rest in the bedroom. They got upset with me, saying that I was trying to push them away and that they wanted to be part of the gathering. I reiterated that I just wanted them to feel better and that we could enjoy the evening without them overexerting themselves.

We ended up having a bit of a disagreement in front of our friends, which made the atmosphere awkward. I felt caught between wanting to take care of my partner and wanting to enjoy the evening with our friends. Eventually, my partner left the room in frustration, and I felt guilty for suggesting they step away.

After our guests left, we had a heart-to-heart. My partner understood that I was only trying to look out for them, but they felt hurt that I didn’t support their desire to stay involved. I realized I might have been too focused on trying to manage the situation instead of listening to their feelings.

Now, I’m left wondering if I handled things poorly. Was I wrong to suggest they take a break during our gathering? I want to be supportive, but I also want to ensure they take care of their health.

She has expressed a strong desire to pursue a career in dance, which she is incredibly passionate about. However, our parents are pushing her to consider more traditional college paths, like pursuing a degree in business or healthcare, because they believe it will offer her more stability and job security.

A few weeks ago, she confided in me that she feels obligated to follow our parents' wishes, even though her heart is set on dance. I encouraged her to follow her passion and reminded her that it’s her life and she should choose a path that makes her happy, but I also understand where our parents are coming from. They grew up in a different era and believe that a stable job is crucial for a successful life.

Last weekend, we had a family dinner where the topic came up, and I gently supported my sister in expressing her feelings. My parents reacted strongly, arguing that she was being reckless and that dancing is not a viable career. I tried to mediate the conversation, emphasizing that both sides have valid points, but tensions rose, and my sister ended up feeling overwhelmed and upset.

No one is the Asshole,"I’ll try to keep this brief, but I need to share what’s been happening lately.

I recently moved back to my hometown after living abroad for a few years. When I got back, I reconnected with my childhood friend, Alex, who I hadn’t seen in ages. We used to be inseparable, but life got in the way. Alex has always been a bit introverted, and I noticed they seemed a bit withdrawn during our catch-up. 

After a few hangouts, I learned that Alex had gone through a tough time while I was away. They had lost their job and were struggling with mental health issues. I wanted to support them, so I started inviting them out more often, thinking it would help lift their spirits. However, Alex was often hesitant, and I began to worry I was pushing too hard.

One weekend, I planned a small gathering at my place with a few mutual friends. I was really looking forward to it, but when I invited Alex, they said they weren't feeling up to it. I respected their decision but felt sad that they wouldn’t join us. The night came, and I could tell the vibe was off. My friends were having fun, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that Alex was missing out.

Later that evening, I sent Alex a message letting them know I missed them and was thinking about them. I encouraged them to come over, even just for a little while. I really wanted them to feel included and supported. However, Alex replied saying they appreciated my concern but really needed some time to themselves and felt overwhelmed by social situations right now.

Looking back, I realize I might have overstepped by trying to push them into socializing when they clearly needed their space. I just wanted to help, but I can see how it could have come off as intrusive. 

So now I’m wondering, should I have respected their boundaries more? Am I the asshole for wanting to include my friend in social activities when they clearly needed time alone?",249,2117,0.65,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_75012,2018-07-23 00:00:00,NAH,1898,AITA

I (28M) have been friends with a group of people for years now, and we typically hang out every weekend. Recently, one of my friends, Sarah (27F), started dating someone new, and she's really into him. She seems happy, and of course, I’m happy for her too.

However, I’ve noticed that since she started dating him, she's been more distant with our friend group. She rarely joins us for our usual hangouts and seems to prioritize time with her new boyfriend. When she does come around, she often talks about him and seems a bit distracted. It’s been a little tough on the rest of us, as we miss hanging out with her.

Last weekend, I organized a get-together and sent out an invite, hoping she’d come. When she responded, she mentioned that she’d love to come but would have to leave early to meet up with her boyfriend. I mentioned jokingly in the group chat that we might need to stage an intervention to get her back, which I thought was lighthearted. 

The group chat had mixed reactions, with some people laughing and others expressing that it might come off as harsh. Sarah saw the message and responded by saying she felt hurt and that I should be supportive of her happiness. I immediately apologized and explained that I didn’t mean any harm; I just miss our time together and thought it would be funny. 

Now I feel bad because I can see her point, and I didn't mean to make her feel bad about her relationship. I want to be supportive and encourage her happiness, but I also miss my friend.

No one is the Asshole,"**Title:** AITA for not wanting to go to my friend’s destination wedding?

**Story:** I (28F) recently received an invitation to my close friend’s wedding in a beautiful tropical location. I’ve known her for over a decade, and I’m genuinely happy for her, but there are a few factors that make me hesitant about attending.

First, the wedding is going to be a weekend-long event, and it’s going to require a significant financial investment. Between the travel expenses, accommodation, and the fact that I would likely need to buy a new dress for the occasion, it’s all adding up to a lot more than I can comfortably afford right now. I’m currently in a tight financial situation as I’m saving up for a new job that starts in a few months with a lower salary. 

Second, the wedding is in a remote location, and I would have to take time off from work. I have limited vacation days, and taking time off for a destination wedding feels a bit excessive, especially considering I’m trying to save my days for some personal matters later in the year.

Lastly, while I love my friend dearly, I’m not very close with the other attendees on the guest list. Most of them are from her college years, and I worry I would feel out of place or left out during the festivities.

I talked to my friend about my concerns, and she expressed disappointment but also understanding. She assured me that she values our friendship and that it’s okay if I can’t make it. However, I still feel guilty about not being there for such a significant moment in her life.

My grandmother is very traditional and has strong opinions about family values and how we should take care of one another. Recently, she has been struggling with her health and has expressed a desire to move in with me instead of staying in her house alone.

I want to help her, but the idea of her moving in is daunting for me. I live in a small one-bedroom apartment, and I’ve worked hard to create a space that feels like my own. Additionally, I’m at a point in my life where I am focused on advancing my career, and I worry that having her with me full-time would be a significant distraction. I’ve been trying to find a balance between honoring her wishes and maintaining my own independence.

After discussing it with my parents, they suggested that I should just let her move in and that it’s the right thing to do. They believe that family should always come first, and that my career can wait. When I talked to my grandmother about it, she was very understanding but also expressed disappointment when I told her I didn’t think I could accommodate her right now.

We ended up having an emotional conversation where she said she felt unwanted and that it would mean so much to her to have family around her in this time. I felt terrible because I truly love her, but I also felt overwhelmed by the pressure of the situation. 

I ended up suggesting that we could look into having someone come in to help her a few times a week instead, or perhaps I could visit her more often. She seemed appreciative of the idea but made it clear that what she really wanted was to be with me.

So, I’ve been friends with this guy, Jake, for a few years now. We both enjoy playing video games together and often hang out on weekends. Recently, Jake started dating this girl, Sarah, who is really into fitness and health. 

The issue started when Jake began bringing Sarah along to our gaming sessions. At first, I thought it was cool to meet her, but it quickly became clear that she wasn’t into gaming at all. She would interrupt our matches, making comments about how we should be outside exercising instead, or suggest we take breaks to go for a run. I tried to be polite, but it was frustrating because Jake and I had established our weekend routine for a long time, and now it felt like it was being disrupted.

One day, during a particularly intense gaming session, Sarah insisted that we stop and go for a jog. I gently explained that we had plans to finish this game and that we all enjoy this time together. Jake seemed a bit torn, wanting to please Sarah but also wanting to game with me. Eventually, he decided to stick with our plans, but I could see Sarah was annoyed.

After that session, Sarah talked to Jake about how she felt unwelcome and that we needed to focus more on health. Jake mentioned it to me later, and I completely understood where she was coming from, but I also felt that she should respect our interests too. It led to a few awkward conversations and tension between the three of us.

I love Jake and don’t want to create issues in his relationship, but I also don’t want to abandon our friendship for his new girlfriend. I’ve tried talking to him about how we can find a balance, but it seems like every time Sarah is around, it becomes a point of contention.

About halfway through the movie, Sarah accidentally spilled a bowl of popcorn all over my couch.

While we were cleaning, Sarah seemed genuinely sorry and helped me clean up the mess. However, what bothered me was that she didn't really say “I’m sorry” or acknowledge the potential damage to my couch. I didn’t want to make her feel bad, but I also felt a little frustrated because I take pride in my home and wanted to maintain it.

After we finished cleaning, we did end up watching the rest of the movie, and the night ended on a good note. However, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wanted her to acknowledge the mishap more directly.

I suggested that we could talk to their parents and see if it would be okay for us to keep my gift as a surprise for the day of her birthday.

In the end, we decided to approach their parents together and share our thoughts. They agreed that Mia would love both gifts and appreciated our concern for her feelings. We came to a consensus that we would celebrate her birthday by giving her both gifts, ensuring that she feels supported and loved from all sides.

It felt great that we could communicate openly and find a solution that focused on Mia’s happiness without anyone feeling like they had to compete for her attention.",816,2089,0.63,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_71603,2021-07-20 00:00:00,NAH,1984,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Throwaway account because my friend knows my main.

So, I (M28) have a close friend (F27) who recently started a new job after being unemployed for a while. She's been really excited about it and has been telling me all about her experiences. The thing is, she’s been super stressed and overwhelmed with the workload, and I can totally relate since I’ve been through similar situations.

Last week, I invited her over for dinner to celebrate her new job. I went all out, cooking her favorite meal and preparing a nice dessert. While we were eating, she started talking about her struggles at work, and I tried to empathize by sharing my own experiences. However, I may have unintentionally overshadowed her feelings by talking about how I dealt with similar stress in the past.

At one point, she interrupted me and said that she appreciated my input, but she just wanted to vent and feel heard. I immediately realized that I had taken the conversation away from her, and I felt awful. I apologized and let her talk without interjecting for the rest of the evening.

After she left, I felt like I might have messed things up. I really care about her and want to support her, but I didn’t mean to make her feel like her feelings weren’t valid. I reached out to her the next day to apologize again and let her know that I’m here for her if she needs to talk.

Am I the asshole for not being more mindful during our conversation?",719,967,0.51,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_95027,2018-07-07 00:00:00,NAH,1426,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, I went to a local coffee shop the other day to grab my usual drink and get some work done. It was a busy Saturday morning, and the place was packed. I managed to find a small table near the window, and after ordering my coffee, I sat down with my laptop.

While I was working, a couple came in and sat at the table next to mine. They were chatting and laughing, and it was clear they were having a good time. At one point, the woman accidentally knocked over her drink, and it spilled onto my table. I quickly jumped up to help her clean it up, and we both apologized profusely. 

After that, we got into a conversation about how clumsy we can be sometimes. I shared a funny story about the time I spilled coffee all over myself during a meeting, and we all laughed. The guy also shared a similar story, and it was nice to bond over our shared experiences.

However, as we talked, I noticed that the woman had a particular expression that seemed to change slightly when I made a joke that was a bit self-deprecating about my clumsiness. I thought it was funny, and I didn't mean to offend her, but she looked a bit uncomfortable for a moment. I quickly apologized if I went too far and reassured her that it was all in good fun.

The guy seemed to sense this too and said, ""Hey, we all have our moments. No harm done!"" We continued chatting for a bit longer, and by the time I finished my work, the atmosphere was relaxed again.

As I left, I felt a little awkward about potentially crossing a line, but overall, I think we all just had a genuine interaction. I hope I didn’t make her feel uncomfortable, but I also think it was a harmless moment that we all laughed about in the end.

AITA for joking around with them, or was it just a misunderstanding?",945,1517,0.89,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_15108,2018-08-28 00:00:00,NAH,1758,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"A few weeks ago, my friend Jess invited me to a small gathering at her place. She mentioned that she’d be inviting a couple of her friends over, and I was excited since I hadn’t met many new people lately. When I arrived, I found out that one of the friends she invited was a guy named Mark, who Jess had been talking to but hadn’t officially started dating yet. 

As the evening progressed, Jess and Mark hit it off, and it was nice to see them connecting. However, there was another guy at the gathering, Ethan, who seemed to be interested in me. He was friendly and we had some decent conversations, but I just didn’t feel any chemistry between us. I appreciated his attention, and I didn’t want to be rude or hurt his feelings, so I tried to be polite and engaged without leading him on.

Eventually, Jess noticed that Ethan was getting a bit too forward and suggested we play some games to lighten the mood. During one of the games, Ethan made a comment that rubbed me the wrong way, and I felt uncomfortable. Jess picked up on it and tried to steer the conversation away, which helped, but I could tell that Ethan was still interested in pursuing me.

After the gathering, Jess and I talked about how the night went. I expressed my concerns about Ethan's behavior and how I didn't want to hurt him but also didn't want to encourage anything further. Jess understood and mentioned that she would talk to him about it, emphasizing that while it’s okay to be interested, it’s important to respect others' boundaries.

I felt relieved that we could talk about it openly without any hard feelings, and I know Jess will handle it with kindness. I’m just wondering if my approach to the situation was okay and if I might have unintentionally hurt Ethan's feelings. Would I be the asshole for not reciprocating his interest?",168,1341,0.93,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_38434,2018-11-23 00:00:00,NAH,1822,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I’ve been feeling a bit conflicted about a recent situation, and I’m hoping to get some perspective.

I’ve been volunteering at a local animal shelter for the past year. I love working with the animals and the team there is great. Recently, they decided to host a fundraising event, and I was really excited about it. I wanted to contribute as much as I could, so I offered to help organize it.

As we started planning, it became clear that everyone had different ideas about what the event should look like. Some people wanted a formal dinner, while others suggested a fun carnival-type atmosphere. I had my own vision, which was more of a casual outdoor gathering with games and activities for families. When I presented my idea, I was met with mixed reactions. Some people loved it, but others felt it didn’t align with what they had in mind.

After a few discussions, I decided to take charge of organizing the outdoor gathering since it seemed to resonate with a part of the team. However, I later found out that a couple of my co-volunteers felt sidelined and thought I was dismissing their ideas. They expressed their frustration to me directly, and I honestly didn’t mean to shut anyone down. I just felt passionate about making the event something enjoyable for everyone involved.

Now, I’m feeling guilty for possibly coming off as domineering. I respect their opinions and want to create a collaborative atmosphere, but I also wanted to ensure that the event was set in motion quickly. I reached out to them after realizing how they felt, and we agreed to incorporate some of their suggestions into the planning.

A few weeks into their relationship, Sarah invited me to meet Jake. I was excited but also cautious because I've had a bad experience with a friend's partner in the past. When I met him, he seemed nice enough, but I noticed some red flags in the way he spoke about past relationships and his views on women.

After our meeting, I expressed my concerns to Sarah. I told her that I didn't want to be overly critical, but I felt Jake's attitudes were concerning and that he might not treat her as she deserves. Sarah got defensive and said she was happy and didn't want me to meddle in her relationship.

I realized that I may have overstepped and that my intentions had come off wrong. I apologized for expressing my worries too strongly and promised to support her no matter what. We agreed to disagree, and I would try to keep my opinions to myself moving forward.

A few weeks later, I noticed that Sarah seemed a bit off. I reached out to her, and she admitted that things with Jake weren't as great as she had hoped. They had some arguments, and he was becoming more controlling. She thanked me for my honesty and admitted she wished she had taken my concerns more seriously.

I felt relieved that I didn’t push her away by being overly critical, and I’m glad she felt comfortable coming to me for support. I’ve been helping her find ways to navigate her feelings about the relationship.

A few weeks ago, I hosted a small family dinner at my place. I invited my sister, our parents, and a couple of friends. My sister has been very passionate about her new vegan diet and has been vocal about it for months now. I totally respect her choices, but I’ve got a mixed diet and I didn’t plan on making the whole dinner vegan. I decided to make a few dishes that included meat, but I also prepared a couple of vegan options for her so she wouldn't feel left out.

When she arrived, she immediately noticed the meat dishes and seemed disappointed. I went out of my way to show her the vegan options I had made, but she started expressing her frustration, saying I should have considered her more and that it feels inconsiderate to have meat around when she’s made such a lifestyle change. I explained that I thought I was being accommodating by providing both options, but she continued to voice her discontent, saying it felt dismissive of her lifestyle.

The argument escalated when our parents got involved, trying to mediate. My sister felt like I was trivializing her choices, while I felt like she was being overly sensitive since I did make an effort to accommodate her. After the dinner, she left in a huff and hasn’t spoken to me since.

I don’t think I did anything wrong by wanting to share a meal with my family while also offering her options. But on the other hand, I can see how she might feel unconsidered.

Last weekend, my friend Sarah invited me over for a movie night. We planned to watch some horror films and just hang out. I arrived at her place, and we set up some snacks and drinks in her living room. As we were getting ready to start the first movie, we began joking around and playfully throwing popcorn at each other.

At one point, I stood up to grab some more popcorn from the kitchen. As I turned around with a big bowl in my hands, Sarah playfully lunged at me to try and steal some popcorn. In the heat of the moment, I didn’t see her coming and, without thinking, I shifted the bowl to protect it and accidentally flung some popcorn right into her face. 

She dramatically gasped and then started laughing, but as she tried to wipe the popcorn away, she stumbled and knocked over a glass of soda on the coffee table. It spilled everywhere, soaking the couch and the carpet. For a moment, we both just looked at the mess in shock, and then we burst into laughter.

However, Sarah was also a bit upset about the couch since it was her roommate's, and she didn’t want to get into trouble. I offered to help her clean it up right away. We spent the next hour scrubbing and trying to dry everything out. After we cleaned up, I suggested we order some food to make up for the chaos, and we ended up having a great time eating and chatting about the movie.

Despite the initial mishap, we both agreed it was a funny story to tell later, but I still felt a bit guilty for causing the mess. Sarah reassured me that accidents happen and it was all in good fun.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I recently had an experience that’s been weighing on my mind, and I’m not sure if I handled it the right way. I was at my local coffee shop, which has a pretty cozy vibe and is a popular spot for regulars. One morning, I saw a woman sitting alone at a table with a couple of kids. They were all quietly eating and drinking, and it seemed like they were enjoying their time. 

After a while, a man entered the shop and started talking to the woman. I could overhear bits of their conversation, and it became clear that the man was asking for help. They seemed to know each other, and he was explaining that he had just lost his job and was struggling to make ends meet. The woman appeared visibly uncomfortable and kept looking around, as if she was worried about what others might think.

I felt bad for the man, but I also sensed that the woman didn’t want to engage too deeply. After a couple of minutes, she firmly told him that she couldn’t help him, and he seemed disappointed but didn’t press further. He left the shop, and I could see that the woman was a bit shaken by the interaction, even though she handled it politely.

When she returned to her kids, I felt compelled to say something. I approached her and mentioned that it was nice to see people helping one another, even if it felt uncomfortable at times. I didn’t mean to imply that she should have done more, but I wanted her to feel supported for having been approached. She looked surprised and said she appreciated my sentiment but felt overwhelmed by the whole situation.

Later on, I overheard some other customers discussing her reaction, and it made me wonder if I had overstepped by bringing it up. I now feel conflicted about whether I should have just left her alone after that interaction or if it was okay to show some solidarity. Did I overstep?

We both work, but unexpected medical bills and car repairs have really hit us hard. We've been trying to budget and cut back on expenses, but it's been tough.

Last week, I suggested that we have a yard sale to get rid of some things we no longer need. I thought it would be a good way to make some extra cash and declutter our home. My partner was initially on board, but then started to have second thoughts. They felt that it was somewhat embarrassing to sell our belongings and worried about what others would think. I can understand where they're coming from; people have different values about possessions.

After talking it over, we both agreed that a yard sale wasn’t the right move for us.

I didn’t consult my partner again because I felt certain about my decision, and I thought they would support it.

No one is the Asshole,"I live in a duplex, and my neighbors on the other side are a family with two young kids. They’re generally friendly, and we’ve exchanged pleasantries over the fence a few times. However, I’ve noticed that lately, the kids have been making quite a bit of noise, especially during the evenings and weekends when I’m trying to relax or get work done.

The noise isn’t constant, but there are times when they’re running around, shouting, or playing loud music, which can be quite disruptive. I’ve tried to be understanding; after all, kids will be kids, and they have every right to enjoy their home. However, it has become a little more than I can handle at times, especially when I have deadlines to meet.

A few days ago, I was working on a project that required a lot of focus. The kids were particularly loud, and I could hear them clearly through the wall. After trying to ignore it for a while, I decided to knock on the wall lightly to get their attention, hoping it would remind them to keep the noise down. I didn’t mean to be rude, but I felt that it was necessary.

Later that day, I ran into the dad outside, and he mentioned that he had heard the knocking and was sorry about the noise. He said he was trying to get the kids to settle down but admitted it had been a hectic day. I told him I appreciated his efforts and that I understood kids can be a handful. We had a good conversation, and he assured me they would try to keep the noise down in the evenings.

Since then, I’ve noticed they’ve made an effort to be quieter, and I’ve also been more patient with them. I feel like we’re on the same page now, but when I shared the situation with a friend, they said I shouldn’t have knocked at all because kids can’t help being noisy, and I was being inconsiderate.

They’re planning a small wedding, and he asked me to be his best man. I was honored but felt a bit uneasy about the dynamics since I’ve never been in a family role like that before. 

During the planning, my brother mentioned that he wanted to include his fiancée’s daughter in the ceremony, which I thought was sweet. However, he didn’t want her to be a flower girl because he felt it might overshadow the bride. I understood where he was coming from, but I also thought it might be a nice gesture to involve her in some way. So, I brought it up to him, suggesting they could have a special moment together, maybe during the vows or a family portrait. 

My brother seemed frustrated with me, saying he had already thought it through and wanted the focus to be on them as a couple. I felt bad for suggesting it and didn't mean to undermine his decisions. After that, I tried to back off and let him handle everything the way he wanted.

On the day of the wedding, I noticed that the little girl seemed a bit left out during the reception. I felt a twinge of guilt for not pushing my suggestion harder, but I also didn’t want to overstep.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I need some perspective on a situation I found myself in recently.

My 6-year-old daughter is really into dinosaurs. For weeks, she has been talking about how she wants to go as a dinosaur for Halloween. She was set on being a T-Rex and even drew a little picture of what she wanted to look like. I thought it was adorable and wanted to help her make her vision come to life.

After browsing through a few costume options online, I noticed that most of the T-Rex costumes were not only super pricey but also quite impractical for her age. So, I decided we could DIY something together. We found some green fabric, made a simple dinosaur tail, and I even helped her create a dinosaur hoodie with spikes on the back. She was thrilled! 

Now, here's where things got complicated. We were at the store gathering supplies, and my daughter saw a dinosaur mask that looked pretty realistic. She begged me for it, and I hesitated because I wasn’t sure how it would fit into our DIY project. I told her that I didn’t want to spend extra money on a mask when we were already creating something special together. She was really disappointed, but I promised her we could make a cool dinosaur headpiece instead.

Later, as we were working on the costume at home, she started to get frustrated because it wasn’t coming together as quickly as she wanted. I could see her getting upset and, in an attempt to cheer her up, I jokingly said, “Well, we could always just put a green sheet over you and call it a day!” She laughed at first, but then she pointed out that she didn’t want to be a “green ghost” — she wanted to be a real dinosaur.

In that moment, I felt really bad for not taking her feelings seriously. I decided to put aside my original plan, and we ended up buying the mask together. To my surprise, once we got home and she tried it on, she loved it even more than the DIY costume parts. It turned out to be a great combination, and she was so excited to wear it. 

I felt a bit conflicted, though. On one hand, I wanted to encourage her creativity and the DIY aspect, but on the other hand, I didn’t want to dismiss her excitement for something that made her happy. 

So, I’m wondering: Am I an asshole for initially pushing the DIY idea and not just going along with her request for a mask right away? Or is it reasonable to encourage creativity while also allowing her to enjoy a store-bought option?

I have a 14-year-old daughter named Mia and a 10-year-old son named Sam. Mia has been struggling with anxiety and depression for a couple of years now, and we’ve been working hard to support her through therapy and other resources.

This year, Mia expressed how important it was for her to attend a summer camp specifically designed for teens dealing with mental health issues. The camp is known for its supportive environment and activities that help kids bond and build confidence. However, it’s also quite expensive, and we would have to stretch our budget significantly to make it happen.

Sam, on the other hand, just finished up a baseball season where he really shined. His team is going to a tournament out of state, and the cost for that trip is also substantial. He’s been looking forward to it all year.

After discussing it with my spouse, we decided to prioritize Mia’s camp this summer, believing it would be more beneficial for her mental health. We explained to Sam that Mia really needed this opportunity and that he would still have chances to play baseball in the future.

Sam was understandably disappointed. He loves baseball and had built up excitement about the tournament. He didn’t take it well, and there were some tears and hurt feelings. We assured him that we would support him in finding new opportunities for baseball and that we would make it up to him somehow, perhaps with a fun family activity later in the summer.

Now, some family members have criticized our decision, saying we should have balanced both kids’ needs and taken Sam to the tournament. They argue that it’s unfair to prioritize one child’s needs over the other’s happiness.

I feel conflicted about our choice. We want to support Mia but also want to ensure that Sam knows he’s just as important to us. Our home has been tense since the decision, with Sam feeling hurt and Mia feeling guilty about it.

One day, she called me in tears, feeling overwhelmed and asking for support. I agreed to meet her the next day for coffee to talk things over.

That night, I had plans with another friend, Mike, who was going through a rough patch as well. We had been planning to go to a concert together for weeks. I was really looking forward to it, as it would give us both a chance to unwind and enjoy ourselves. However, when I received Lisa's call, I felt a strong sense of responsibility to help her first.

I decided to send Mike a message explaining the situation and let him know I might need to cancel our plans. He seemed understanding but was clearly disappointed. I reassured him that we could reschedule.

Recently, Lisa decided to host a family get-together at her place to reconnect with everyone, which I think is great. 

However, there’s a catch: she invited her new boyfriend (35m) to join us. I hadn’t met him before, and while I was open to it, I was a bit apprehensive. When we all gathered, I noticed that Lisa’s boyfriend dominated the conversation. It felt like he was trying to impress everyone with his stories, which made it hard for others, including me, to get a word in. I found myself feeling increasingly frustrated as I tried to engage with my sister and other family members, but the boyfriend kept steering the focus back to himself.

At one point, I attempted to share a funny story from my work, but he interrupted me with a loud joke about his own job. I could see Lisa was enjoying him being the center of attention, but I started to feel like an outsider in my own family gathering.

My sister took it as me trying to bring the conversation down and said it was inappropriate to share my worries when she was excited about her trip. I was taken aback but explained that I just wanted to share what was going on in my life, not to overshadow her happiness.

The crowd was cheering her on, but she just stood there, unable to sing a note. After a minute that felt like forever, her anxiety got the best of her, and she left the stage in tears. 

I felt horrible, and I wish I had been up there with her. When I went to comfort her, she told me she felt embarrassed and like she had let everyone down. I reassured her that we were all proud of her for trying and that it was okay to feel nervous. 

Now, some of our other friends think it might be better for Mia to stick to group karaoke to avoid putting her in that situation again. I’m torn because I want her to feel empowered to sing alone if she wants, but I also don’t want to push her too hard. 

Did we make the right call by encouraging her to try a solo, or should we have just kept it to group songs?",890,2269,0.56,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_78650,2022-06-09 00:00:00,NAH,1594,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My friend and I, both 25, have been close for years and often hang out together. Recently, I've been trying to be more mindful of my health and well-being, which includes eating better and exercising. As a result, I've started cooking healthier meals at home and going to the gym regularly.

My friend, however, has not been as enthusiastic about this change. She enjoys her fast food and isn't interested in making lifestyle changes. A few weeks ago, after a gym session, I suggested we cook a healthy dinner together at my place. I thought it would be a fun way to bond, and I wanted to share some recipes I discovered. She reluctantly agreed but kept making comments about how she preferred pizza and junk food.

As we were cooking, she started putting her own spin on the meal by adding a bunch of unhealthy seasonings and even suggesting we order pizza as a side. I gently told her that I wanted to keep the meal healthy, but she laughed it off and kept adding things. I ended up feeling frustrated because I felt like my efforts were being disregarded.

After dinner, I brought up how I was trying to stick to healthier eating habits, and I mentioned that I would appreciate her support in that. She responded by saying that I was being too uptight and that I should just enjoy life a little. This led to a bit of a back-and-forth, where I tried to explain my perspective, and she expressed that she felt I was trying to impose my views on her.

In the end, we both calmed down and agreed that we could enjoy our different lifestyles without judgment. I just want to ensure I’m living a healthy life, while she wants to enjoy her food without feeling pressured.

He spends a lot of time playing online with his friends, which I totally understand since it's a big part of socializing for kids his age. However, I've noticed that he’s been neglecting his homework and chores, often leaving things until the last minute and then getting stressed about it.

I had a conversation with him about balancing his gaming time with his responsibilities. I suggested that he limit his gaming to two hours on school nights and use the rest of his free time for homework and chores. He got really upset and said I was being unfair and that his friends get to play as much as they want after school.

I tried to explain that I just want him to succeed in school and that too much gaming can affect that, but he still seems really mad at me. Now he’s been telling his friends that I’m a strict parent who doesn’t understand him.

No one is the Asshole,"So, I was at my best friend’s wedding this past weekend. Let’s call her Sarah. It was a beautiful ceremony, and I was really happy for her and her new husband. However, during the reception, I noticed that one of the groomsmen, whom I’ll call Mike, seemed to be acting a bit off. 

Mike and I have a friendly relationship, but we’ve never been super close. Throughout the night, he was pretty reserved and didn’t seem to be enjoying himself. At one point, I noticed he stepped away from the table and went outside, looking upset. 

Now, I didn’t want to invade his space, but I felt compelled to check on him. I stepped out and found him sitting on a bench, looking a bit teary-eyed. I sat down next to him and asked if he was okay. He opened up about how he was feeling overwhelmed with everything going on, especially because he had just gone through a tough breakup a few months ago. 

I listened to him and offered some words of encouragement, saying it was okay to feel that way and that he could take a moment for himself. We talked for a bit longer, and he seemed to appreciate having someone to talk to. 

After a while, I suggested we head back in since the dancing was about to start, and he agreed. He thanked me for checking on him, and we went back to the party. 

Later that night, Sarah mentioned that she saw me outside with Mike and said she appreciated me being there for him. However, she also expressed concern that it might make the groomsmen uncomfortable having someone else step into a personal moment. 

Now I’m left wondering if I overstepped by checking on him when I wasn’t very close to him. I just wanted to be a good friend and offer support.

No one is the Asshole,"I have a younger sister, Mia, who is in her final year of high school. She’s been really stressed about her upcoming exams and college applications. I’m very supportive of her, and I try to help her study and encourage her as much as I can. However, I also work full-time and have my own responsibilities, which sometimes makes it hard for me to be there for her as much as I’d like.

Last week, Mia had a breakdown about her exams. She was overwhelmed and felt like she wasn’t going to be able to cope. In an effort to help, I decided to take a day off from work to spend time with her. We planned a day of studying together, but I also thought it would be nice to take her out for lunch and let her unwind a bit.

I arranged everything, but when I woke up that morning, I wasn’t feeling great. I had a mild cold, but I thought I could manage. I still wanted to be there for Mia, so I pushed through. We spent the morning studying, but I could tell she was still tense. I suggested we take a break and go out for lunch, but as we were walking to the restaurant, I started to feel worse. I ended up feeling lightheaded and had to sit down for a moment.

Mia noticed and immediately became concerned. I told her it was just a little cold and that I was okay, but she insisted we go back home instead. I felt bad because I had taken the day off for her, and I thought she really needed the break. I wanted to push through for her sake, but I also didn’t want to make myself worse.

Eventually, I agreed to go back home. Mia was relieved, but I felt guilty for not being able to follow through with our plans. I know she was looking forward to that day, and I really wanted to be the supportive sibling she needed. I talked to her about it later, and she told me she appreciated the effort but was really just glad I wasn’t pushing myself when I wasn’t feeling well.

Afterward, I reflected on the day, and I wondered if I had let her down. I care deeply about her well-being and want to be there for her, but I also realize that sometimes, you have to take care of yourself first.

No one is the Asshole,"I’m posting here because I’m feeling a bit conflicted about a situation I had with my family recently, and I wanted to get some outside perspective. I have a close-knit family and we usually get together for big holiday dinners, which I love. This past Thanksgiving, we decided to host the dinner at my place, since I have a bigger kitchen and dining area.

I spent days preparing the meal, really wanting to impress everyone. I made all the traditional dishes and even tried a few new recipes. I was excited to see everyone and catch up. However, as the evening progressed, I realized that my cousin, who I’ll call Sarah, was feeling a bit off. She was quiet and didn’t engage much with the conversation.

Later in the evening, during dessert, Sarah finally spoke up. She mentioned that she was feeling overwhelmed because she recently lost her job and was struggling to find a new one. I immediately felt bad because I had been so focused on the food and festivities that I hadn’t noticed her discomfort. I tried to shift the conversation to be more inclusive, asking her about her job search and offering support, but the rest of the family seemed oblivious and continued discussing lighter topics.

After dinner, I pulled Sarah aside and apologized for not being more aware of how she was feeling. I told her that I would love to talk more about it if she wanted. She appreciated my concern but also mentioned that she didn’t want to bring down the mood of the celebration. It made me feel guilty, like I had inadvertently created an atmosphere where she felt she couldn’t share her struggles.

I’ve been thinking about whether I should have kept the conversation more serious during dinner or if it was okay to let the festivities continue as they were. I don’t want to feel like I’m the bad guy for wanting to enjoy our family time, but I also want to be there for Sarah.

Recently, she decided to get into painting and started sharing her artwork on social media. I think it’s wonderful that she found a new passion! 

However, she also asked me if I could promote her work to my friends and followers since I have a decent-sized social media presence. I’ve always supported her endeavors, but I hesitated this time. I’ve seen her paintings, and while they’re not bad, I don’t think they’re ready for the spotlight just yet. I’m worried that if I share them and my friends don’t like them, it might hurt her feelings or damage her confidence.

So, I gently told her that I think she should keep working on her craft and maybe wait until she feels more confident before promoting it widely. She got a bit upset and said she was just asking for support from me as her sister, and it felt like I was tearing her down. I explained my thoughts, but she still seemed hurt.

Now I’m wondering if I was too harsh in my feedback. I don’t want to discourage her, but at the same time, I think it’s important to be honest about where she is with her art. 

Am I the asshole for not wanting to promote my sister’s work right now?

However, a few weeks ago, she confided in me that she was having doubts about the relationship. She loved this guy, but there were some aspects she wasn't sure about, mainly regarding his commitment and future plans.

During this time, I was also planning a surprise birthday party for her. I wanted it to be a celebration filled with friends and fun, so I spent a lot of time organizing it. The night before the party, I had a conversation with her boyfriend where he mentioned wanting to propose to her soon. He said he wanted to talk to her about their future during the party, which I thought was sweet.

I found myself in a tough spot. I wanted to keep the party a surprise, but I also felt that it was important for my friend to be aware of what was happening with her relationship before committing to anything big like a proposal. I decided to tell her about the boyfriend's plans, thinking it would prepare her for the conversation.

When she found out, she was hurt and angry with me. She wanted to enjoy the party without that pressure looming over her. I completely understood where she was coming from—she felt I ruined the surprise and potentially put her in a difficult position regarding her relationship.

I never intended to create drama; I just wanted to protect her feelings. Now I feel caught in the middle.

It was really hard for both of us, and even though we mutually decided to end things, the emotional fallout has been heavy. We are still in the same friend group, which complicates things, but I thought we could manage it.

A couple of weeks after the breakup, one of our mutual friends threw a small gathering. I was apprehensive about attending, but I didn’t want to miss out on seeing my friends. I decided to go, hoping to keep things civil. When I arrived, I noticed my ex was already there, and she seemed to be in good spirits. I tried my best to stay positive and engage with others.

As the night went on, I noticed that my ex was flirting with another guy in our friend group. At first, I felt a bit uncomfortable, but I tried to shake it off. However, the more they interacted, the more it bothered me. I ended up stepping outside for some fresh air to gather my thoughts. 

While I was outside, another friend came out to check on me. I confided in her about how I was feeling and how seeing my ex with someone else was really hard for me. I didn’t say anything mean about my ex, but I did express that I felt hurt and betrayed by her actions, especially so soon after our breakup.

My friend listened and offered support, but then she suggested that I should just be happy for my ex and move on. I felt a bit defensive and explained that while I wanted to support her happiness, I wasn’t ready to see her with someone else so quickly and that it was okay for me to feel upset about it. We had a calm discussion, and I told her I would try to focus on myself instead.

Later that night, I overheard my ex talking to another friend about how I seemed “bitter” and “not over her,” which hurt. I didn’t want to be that way; I just needed time to heal.

I felt a mixture of emotions, especially since our breakup was pretty rough, and I had finally moved on and started dating someone new. I debated whether or not to respond but ultimately decided to reach out and see how she was doing. We ended up having a long conversation, and I felt like I was able to provide her some support during a time that must have been really overwhelming for her.

I told my current girlfriend about the conversation the next day, before the wedding. She was supportive and understood that I wanted to be there for my ex in a time of need. However, when I got to the wedding, I noticed that several mutual friends of ours were gossiping about my ex's pregnancy and our conversation. I felt uncomfortable and realized that I had unintentionally put myself in a position where people were discussing my past relationship when I was there to celebrate my friend's big day.

I later apologized to my girlfriend for putting her in an awkward spot, and she said she understood but felt a bit hurt that I had reached out to my ex at all, especially the night before such an important event.

The other day, we were talking, and he mentioned that he's considering moving back in with his parents to save money since he hasn’t had any luck finding a job. I felt a pang of concern because while I completely understand his need to save, I worry about how that might change our relationship dynamics. 

I also shared with him that I’ve been feeling overwhelmed by the pressure of managing my own career and future while also trying to support him through his challenges. I don’t want to sound unsupportive, but I’m also worried that if he goes back home, it might slow down his progress or motivation, and I’d feel guilty if he felt like I was pushing him away.

During this conversation, I suggested that maybe he should consider taking a break from job hunting to figure out what he really wants to do. I know it can be overwhelming to keep applying for jobs with no response, and he seemed to appreciate the idea of taking some time for self-reflection. However, after I mentioned it, he got quiet, and I could see that he was feeling even worse. I felt really bad because that wasn’t my intention at all.

I don't want to be an asshole for expressing my concerns, but I also don't want to push him away in the process. Am I being insensitive to his situation, or is it okay to share my feelings about our relationship and future?",173,2744,0.72,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_66199,2022-07-28 00:00:00,NAH,1746,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So my sister and I have always been close, but recently we've found ourselves in a bit of a disagreement. She has a small business that she started a couple of years ago, and I've been helping her out with social media and marketing strategies. I really enjoy it, and it's been exciting to see her business grow.

Recently, she secured a big contract with a local company, and I helped her come up with a proposal that played a significant role in winning that contract. After the success of the contract, she received a significant payment, and I was really happy for her. However, I felt that my contributions were substantial enough to warrant some form of compensation for my work.

I mentioned to her that I would appreciate a small percentage of the payment as a thank-you for my help. She was taken aback and said that she didn’t think it was necessary since we’re family and she never expected to pay me for my help. I understand where she’s coming from, but I also feel like my time and expertise should be valued, even if it’s within family.

Now I’m torn. Part of me thinks it’s reasonable to ask for something in return for my contributions, especially since it helped her business so much. But I also don’t want to strain our relationship by coming off as greedy or entitled. 

AITA for asking my sister for compensation for my help with her business? 

EDIT: Just to clarify, I’ve never charged her for my assistance before, and I don’t have a formal agreement in place. Our arrangement has always been informal, but I felt that this time was different given the scale of the contract and the impact of my work.",80,717,0.84,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_46174,2022-09-23 00:00:00,NAH,1625,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"So, I recently had a bit of a disagreement with my roommate, Sarah. We’ve been living together for a couple of years, and for the most part, we get along really well. However, we do have some different lifestyles. I’m more of a night owl, and I often stay up late watching movies or playing video games, while Sarah likes to go to bed early because she has a 9-to-5 job.

The other night, I was playing a game and I didn’t realize how loud I was being until Sarah knocked on my door. She asked me to keep it down because she was trying to sleep, and I totally understood her frustration. I apologized and turned the volume down, but then she came in and expressed that this wasn’t the first time it had happened. She said she felt like I didn’t respect her need for quiet after a long day at work.

I explained that I didn’t mean to be loud and that I would try to be more mindful in the future. However, I also mentioned that I think it’s important for both of us to compromise. Since I’m often up late, I suggested that maybe she could use some earplugs or listen to some white noise if she needed to go to bed early. I felt like I was trying to offer a reasonable solution. 

She got upset, saying that she shouldn’t have to change her routine just because I like to stay up late. I didn’t intend to dismiss her feelings, but I also wanted to highlight that we both have to make accommodations for each other in a shared living space. 

After our conversation, things were a bit tense for a couple of days, but eventually, we talked it out and came to a mutual understanding. We agreed that I would try to be quieter, and she would consider using earplugs on nights when I was gaming. 

Now, I’m wondering if I was wrong to suggest that she change her routine to accommodate me, or if it was fair for me to point out that we each need to compromise. Am I the asshole for suggesting she use earplugs instead of expecting me to completely change my habits?",74,1348,0.73,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_57246,2022-06-02 00:00:00,NAH,1957,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I have a bit of a complicated situation involving my sister and my parents. For context, I (29F) have always been the ""responsible"" sibling, while my sister (26F) has tended to be more carefree and spontaneous. This difference in our personalities has caused some friction over the years, but we've managed to maintain a decent relationship.

Recently, our parents celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary, and they decided to renew their vows. They wanted it to be a big family event, so they asked us to help organize everything. I took charge of planning the details, from the venue to the decorations, and my sister was excited to contribute her ideas as well.

However, as we started to plan, I noticed that my sister was suggesting some rather extravagant and impractical ideas that would have blown our budget out of the water. While I appreciated her enthusiasm, I felt it was my responsibility to keep things in check. After discussing it with her, I set a firm budget and suggested we stick to more practical options.

This didn’t sit well with her. She felt that I was stifling her creativity and ruining the fun of planning such a special occasion. Our conversations turned into arguments, and I ended up feeling frustrated but also guilty for not being more accommodating. In the end, we both made compromises, and the event turned out beautifully, but the tension lingered.

At the anniversary celebration, my sister pulled me aside and expressed how hurt she felt during the planning process. She said I had taken control of everything and made her feel unimportant. I apologized, and we ended up having a heartfelt conversation about our different approaches, realizing that we both had the same goal: to make our parents happy.

Now, I can't help but wonder if I was too harsh on her during the planning phase. It was never my intention to make her feel sidelined, but I felt it was necessary to keep the event within budget.

No one is the Asshole,"A few weeks ago, I was at a local park enjoying a sunny afternoon. While I was sitting on a bench, I noticed a woman sitting nearby with her young child. The child was clearly upset and crying because they wanted an ice cream from the nearby vendor. The mother, looking stressed, explained to the child that they didn't have enough money for ice cream that day.

I could see the disappointment on the child's face, and I felt for both of them. I was in a position to help, so I approached them and offered to buy the child an ice cream. The mother was surprised and grateful, but she hesitated and said she didn't want to accept charity. I assured her that it was just a small gesture to make the child happy, and she finally agreed.

After I bought the ice cream, the child’s face lit up with joy. The mother thanked me profusely, and we chatted for a bit about how tough parenting can be. I ended up feeling really good about the interaction, and we parted ways with smiles.

A few days later, I mentioned this encounter to a friend, and they suggested that I might have overstepped by offering help without knowing the family’s situation or if they really needed it. I started to second-guess myself, wondering if I had unintentionally embarrassed the mother or made her feel uncomfortable.

One of my friends, Sarah, has a dietary restriction due to allergies, which she’s mentioned before, so I made sure to ask her what she could eat. She told me she was fine with pizza as long as it was from a specific place that could accommodate her needs. I promised to order from that restaurant.

On the night of the gathering, I ordered pizza from the preferred place, but I also got a few other snacks and a different kind of pizza for those who might want something more traditional. I thought it would be a nice variety. 

As the night went on, everyone was having a great time, but when Sarah arrived, she seemed upset. I asked her what was wrong, and she expressed disappointment that I didn’t stick to just the pizza she could eat, saying she felt left out when everyone else was enjoying the other food. I explained that I wanted to provide options for everyone and didn't mean to exclude her. 

After a bit of discussion, we all settled down and I made sure Sarah had plenty to eat. The night continued, and we had a lot of fun playing games together. 

The next day, I got a message from Sarah saying she appreciated my efforts but felt I should have been more considerate by solely focusing on her needs since she was the one with allergies. I felt bad that she was upset, but I also thought it was reasonable to offer a variety for the group.

So, I’ve been volunteering at a local animal shelter for a few months now. I really love working with the animals and helping out the staff. Recently, we had a big adoption event, and it was my job to help check in the families and handle some of the paperwork.

During the event, there was a family who had adopted a puppy. They seemed really excited, which was great to see. However, while I was helping them complete the last bit of paperwork, the kids were running around playing with the other animals, which started to create a bit of chaos. I gently reminded the kids to be careful and stay close to their parents. 

The parents seemed a bit overwhelmed and didn’t really manage the kids as closely as I would have hoped, which led to one of the kids accidentally knocking over a display of pet supplies. Thankfully, nothing broke, but the mess created a bit of a scene.

I approached the family and calmly explained the importance of keeping the area tidy for everyone's safety and to ensure a positive experience for other visitors. They seemed a bit defensive and said they were just letting their kids have fun. I understood where they were coming from, but I also felt responsible for maintaining the shelter's environment.

In the end, we all ended up cleaning up the mess together, and the family left with their puppy looking happy. I felt a little bad for how I handled it, but I also wanted to keep things organized and safe at the event.

As the trip approached, I noticed that one of my friends, Jake, seemed increasingly anxious about the whole thing. He mentioned a few times that he wasn’t sure if he could afford to go, but we all assured him that we’d help him out if needed. However, he ultimately decided to join the trip.

On the day of the trip, while we were loading up the cars, I could see Jake looking a bit overwhelmed. He kept asking everyone if they had packed certain items and seemed particularly concerned about the cost of food. I reassured him that we had planned for everything, and he could share costs with me.

Once we arrived at the campsite, things went smoothly for the first day. We had a great time hiking, setting up the campfire, and eating together. However, the next morning, Jake seemed more withdrawn. During breakfast, he began to voice his concerns about the budget, saying he felt guilty for ""mooching"" off everyone.

I tried to alleviate his worries, telling him that we were all friends and it was about enjoying the time together rather than stressing about money. But Jake kept bringing it up, and it started to feel like it was ruining the mood for everyone. 

Finally, I snapped a little and told him that he should just enjoy the trip and stop worrying about money. I said something like, ""We're all friends here, and we wanted you to come. Just have fun!"" He looked taken aback and didn't say much after that. The atmosphere felt heavy, and I realized I might have been too harsh.

After the trip, Jake didn't reach out as much, and I could tell he was still upset. I didn’t mean to hurt his feelings; I just wanted him to enjoy the trip like everyone else. A few days later, I texted him to apologize for how I reacted, but he hasn’t responded yet.

I (29F) recently had a bit of a disagreement with my brother (32M) regarding our family holiday plans, and I could use some perspective on whether I'm the asshole in this situation.

Every year, our family takes a trip together, usually to the beach. It’s a tradition we all cherish. This year, however, my brother's wife (30F) suggested that instead of the beach, we should go to a cabin in the mountains for a change of scenery. I thought it was a great idea and mentioned it to my parents, who were also excited about the prospect of a different kind of vacation.

When I brought this idea up to my brother, he was surprisingly resistant. He expressed that he had already made plans in his mind for the beach trip and felt that changing it up would disappoint his kids, who were looking forward to the beach.

I completely understand his feelings, but I thought it might be nice to try something new this year. After some back and forth, my brother said I was being selfish for wanting to change the tradition and that it wasn't fair to his kids. I didn’t mean to come off as selfish; I just wanted to suggest a fun alternative that the whole family could enjoy.

In the end, we decided to compromise and do a split trip: a few days at the beach and then a few days at the cabin. However, tensions are still somewhat high, and I can’t help but feel a bit guilty about suggesting the change in the first place.

So, Reddit, AITA for suggesting we change our family holiday tradition, even if I had the best intentions? Or is my brother being unreasonable for wanting to stick to the previous plans without considering the new idea?

No one is the Asshole,"So, a bit of background: I have a younger brother, Jake, who is 22, and I'm 27. Growing up, we had a competitive relationship, especially when it came to sports and academics. Jake has always been talented, and I’ve often been supportive, but I admit I struggled with it sometimes, feeling overshadowed. 

Recently, Jake decided to enter a local talent competition where he would showcase his music. He’s been passionate about it for years, and I couldn’t be happier for him. His friends and family were really excited about it, and I genuinely wanted to support him. However, I also signed up for the same competition, mainly because I felt inspired by his courage to perform and wanted to challenge myself as well.

When I told Jake, he seemed a bit taken aback. He expressed that he was worried I would overshadow him or that it would turn into a sibling rivalry. I assured him that I didn’t want to compete against him—I just wanted to explore my own musical interests and support his journey. I even suggested that we could perform together for part of the competition or help each other practice.

Unfortunately, he didn’t take it well and felt like I was stealing his spotlight. We ended up having a heated discussion where I tried to explain my intentions, but he was very upset and said he didn’t want to perform anymore if I was also competing. I felt sad and frustrated because I believed we could both shine in our own ways.

Now, I’m left wondering if I was wrong to want to participate in the competition alongside him. I didn’t mean to hurt his feelings, and I really do want the best for him. Our family is divided—some think I should have stepped back, while others think I have every right to compete too. So, am I the asshole for wanting to follow my passion alongside my brother?",962,1711,0.83,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_87861,2024-08-27 00:00:00,NAH,1799,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I recently got a new job and it’s been a huge adjustment for me. I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed with all the changes and responsibilities, and on top of that, I’m trying to keep up with my social life. 

Last weekend, I had planned to hang out with a group of friends at a local bar to unwind. I was really looking forward to it, but as the day approached, I started feeling anxious about it. I was worried I wouldn’t be able to keep up with the conversation and that I might just embarrass myself with how stressed I’ve been. 

On the day of our plans, I was on the phone with my friend, trying to express my concerns. I said something like, “I’m really excited to see everyone, but I’m just not sure I’ll be fun to be around right now.” I thought I was being honest about my feelings, but my friend replied, “Well, if you’re not feeling social, maybe you should just stay home.” 

For a moment, I felt really hurt by that. I thought she was dismissing my feelings and suggesting I shouldn’t come at all, which wasn’t my intention. I snapped back, “Wow, thanks for the support,” and then immediately regretted it. I didn’t mean to come across as rude; I just felt misunderstood.

After I hung up, I spent some time reflecting on my reaction. I realized that my friend was just trying to be honest about her feelings too, and she probably didn’t mean to hurt me. I decided to go out anyway, and it turned out to be a great night filled with laughter and support from my friends.

When I talked to my friend later, we both apologized for our reactions. I appreciate her honesty, and she understood I was just feeling fragile. In the end, I think we both handled it well, but it left me wondering if I overreacted. Was I out of line for being sensitive about her comment?

I made it a point to check in on her more often and invite her to lunch, hoping to lift her spirits. However, I noticed that she often declined and seemed to prefer eating alone at her desk. I didn’t want to push too hard, but I also wanted her to feel included.

One day, I decided to organize a small lunch outing for the team to celebrate a coworker's birthday. I invited everyone, including Sarah, and made sure to emphasize that it was a casual get-together and no pressure if she didn’t want to come. When I mentioned it to her, she looked a bit bothered and said she wasn’t really in the mood to celebrate anything right now.

I felt bad for bringing it up and quickly reassured her that I completely understood and that it was okay if she didn’t want to join us. I didn’t want to make her feel guilty or uncomfortable, but I also wanted to show her that we care.

A few days later, I learned from another coworker that Sarah was actually upset that I hadn’t insisted more for her to come. They said she felt isolated and thought I was excluding her. I was surprised because I thought I was being respectful of her feelings.

I’m now left wondering if I should have pushed her more to join us or if I did the right thing by respecting her wishes. I don’t want to seem like the jerk who doesn’t care about her feelings, but I also didn’t want to pressure her when she’s clearly struggling.

However, as we were discussing the itinerary, I realized that I've been feeling a bit anxious about the travel arrangements. 

I tend to be quite detail-oriented and like having everything planned out in advance. My friend, on the other hand, is more spontaneous and prefers to go with the flow. We’ve clashed a bit over this because I often feel like I need to have things organized to feel comfortable, while my friend feels stifled by too much planning.

When we were discussing accommodation options, I suggested a place I had researched extensively and really liked. My friend was not interested in it and wanted to look at some more casual options. I felt frustrated because I thought my suggestion was more practical, and I pointed out the benefits of the place I liked. In hindsight, I may have come off too strong and dismissive of their preferences.

After our conversation, my friend seemed upset, and I realized that I might have been too pushy. We talked it over, and while we were able to come to a compromise about the accommodations, I still felt bad about how I handled the situation.

I want to ask my friend if they think I was being too controlling or if my feelings about needing a structured plan are valid. I care about our friendship and want to ensure we're both comfortable with the plans we make.

I noticed she was becoming more withdrawn and worried, so I suggested that we could take it easy on the hike and stick to well-marked trails. I assured her that I would be there to guide her and that we could turn back anytime if she felt uncomfortable.

The day of the hike came, and Sarah still seemed anxious. I tried to encourage her, telling her that it would be a great way to relax and enjoy nature. However, when we hit the trail, Sarah quickly became overwhelmed. After about an hour, she asked if we could turn back, saying she was too anxious to continue.

I immediately agreed and we turned back. However, throughout the hike, I found myself feeling a bit disappointed. I had been excited about the experience and felt like we hadn’t even gotten to enjoy it.

After we got back, I expressed my feelings to my friend, saying that I wished we could have completed the trail since I had planned it for so long. My friend gently reminded me that not everyone experiences nature the same way, and that Sarah’s feelings were valid.

My partner comes from a large family, while I have a much smaller one, so we’re trying to find a balance.

A few weeks ago, my partner suggested inviting their cousin who has a history of causing drama at family events. This cousin has made several inappropriate comments in the past, and at one of their family gatherings, they even started a fight with my partner’s sibling. I expressed my concerns, explaining that I didn’t want our wedding day to be overshadowed by potential conflict or uncomfortable moments.

My partner was initially understanding but then started to feel guilty about excluding family, saying that it might hurt the cousin’s feelings. I understand that family is important, but I also believe that our wedding should be a joyful occasion where we feel safe and comfortable. We ended up having a heated discussion about it, which wasn’t our intention.

Eventually, we reached a compromise: we decided to invite the cousin but make it clear in the invitation that there would be a strict no-drama policy at the wedding. That way, we could include them but also set boundaries for our special day. 

I feel a bit conflicted about the situation. I want to be kind and inclusive, but I also want to protect the atmosphere of our wedding. I keep wondering if I should have just let it go and accepted the cousin, or if my concerns were valid.

During the gathering, I noticed that my neighbor seemed a bit overwhelmed with her kids. They were running around and getting a bit rowdy, which was understandable, but it was starting to get a bit disruptive. I gently reminded them to be careful and not to disturb the other guests. 

Later in the evening, while I was in the kitchen preparing some food, my neighbor came in and expressed her frustration. She mentioned that she felt like I was judging her parenting and that I should have just kept the gathering kid-free if I didn’t want to deal with noise. I assured her that wasn’t my intention at all and that I genuinely wanted her and her kids to feel welcome.

We ended up having a calm conversation about it. I explained that I was just trying to keep the atmosphere comfortable for everyone, but I totally understood that kids can be unpredictable. She apologized for assuming the worst and said she appreciated the invitation.

One of my friends, Sarah (31F), has a special diet due to health issues, and she’s very meticulous about her food. I appreciate that she takes care of herself, but I wasn’t sure what to do about it. I sent out a group message asking everyone to label their dishes with ingredients and any allergens. Sarah responded, saying she appreciated it but was concerned about cross-contamination with her food. 

I understood her worry but felt overwhelmed by the planning. I offered to make a separate dish just for her, but she insisted that she would bring her own food instead. I thought that was a good compromise, and I welcomed her choice.

When our dinner night arrived, Sarah brought a full meal that looked delicious. However, when I was serving the main course I made, she seemed hesitant to eat it. I asked if she was okay, and she explained that she felt uncomfortable eating any food that I had prepared because she didn’t trust my kitchen practices completely. 

I was taken aback and felt hurt because I had tried to accommodate her needs. I told her that I had always been careful about food safety and hygiene. My other friends jumped in to defend me, saying that I was a great cook and had always been careful. Sarah then softened and said she didn’t mean to offend me, but she just had bad experiences in the past. 

We ended up having a discussion about how to navigate food preferences and dietary restrictions in our group. It felt like we all understood each other a bit better afterwards, and we agreed to keep open lines of communication in the future.

I was happy to help him out since we're family, but I kind of expected to be compensated for my time and effort. So, I told him I would charge him the same rate I charge the kids. He laughed and said that I shouldn't charge him for it because we're brothers.

I tried to explain that I take lesson planning seriously and that it requires time and dedication, and it feels a bit unfair to not be compensated just because we’re related. He got annoyed and said I was being greedy and that it was family. I ended up telling him that I was fine with helping him, but I’d appreciate it if he could at least cover my snacks while I teach him.

Eventually, we reached a compromise where I would teach him for free, but he would buy pizza for both of us after our sessions. It ended up being a fun experience, and we enjoyed the time spent together.

I feel like I handled the situation well, but I also understand his point about family. Was I wrong to expect some form of compensation?",454,1251,0.71,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_19376,2022-05-03 00:00:00,NAH,1366,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My sister has been planning her wedding for quite a while, and she’s really excited about every detail. Recently, she asked me to be her maid of honor, which I was thrilled about. However, she then mentioned that she wants me to go dress shopping with her and, specifically, she wanted me to wear a dress that matches her wedding colors for the entire duration of the wedding planning.

I completely understand wanting to have a cohesive theme, but the idea of wearing a specific dress for months just to match her colors felt a bit overwhelming to me, especially since I have my own style and preferences. I told her I’d love to help her choose a dress and support her throughout the planning, but I wasn’t comfortable wearing something I didn't feel represents me just for that long.

She seemed a bit disappointed when I explained how I felt, and I tried my best to reassure her that I would be there for her, just in a different way. I suggested that I could help with planning and maybe wear something that fits the theme on the wedding day itself, but she still seemed upset about my resistance to wearing a matching dress during the whole planning process.

I know she’s stressed about the wedding and I want to support her, but I also want to maintain my own comfort and style.

When we got there, my partner was super excited about capturing the experience on video. They pulled out their phone and started filming everything, from the crowd to the performances, and even me dancing.

At first, I was okay with it, but as the day went on, I started to feel overwhelmed. I wanted to enjoy the moment without being recorded constantly. I told my partner that I loved their enthusiasm but that I needed some time to just soak everything in without the camera. They seemed to take this personally and said they were just trying to create memories for us to look back on.

I explained that I appreciate that, but I wanted to engage fully with the experience without having to think about how it looked on camera. My partner got a little defensive and said that it's important to have those memories documented. I didn’t mean to upset them, and I suggested that we could take a few photos together but then put the phone away for a while.

In the end, we compromised by taking a few videos and then enjoying the festival without the camera for a bit. However, there was a bit of tension about it, and I felt bad for hurting their feelings.

So, I (28F) have been friends with Jess (27F) since college. We’ve always been very close, sharing our lives, secrets, and experiences. Recently, Jess started dating someone seriously, and while I’m genuinely happy for her, I’ve noticed that she’s been spending nearly all her time with him and has been a bit distant with our friend group.

A few months ago, we planned a big trip together with our friends, something we’ve done every year since college. Jess seemed excited at first, but as the trip drew closer, she started to back out, saying she wanted to spend time with her boyfriend instead. I tried to be understanding, but I felt hurt because it seemed like she was prioritizing him over our longstanding traditions.

When we finally went on the trip without her, I spoke to her about how I was feeling. I expressed that I missed her and that our friendship felt a bit one-sided lately, with her not putting in the same effort she used to. I didn’t mean to attack her, but I wanted to be honest about how I felt.

To my surprise, she got really defensive and said I was being selfish for wanting her to choose our friendship over her relationship. She argued that she has every right to spend time with her boyfriend and that I should be happy for her. I apologized for making her feel that way and told her I just wanted to find a balance where she could still have her relationship but also maintain our friendship.

Now, I’m feeling conflicted. I care about Jess and want her to be happy, but I also feel like our friendship is slipping away. I don’t want to come across as the bad guy for trying to express my feelings, but I also don’t want to hold her back.

She seemed surprised and apologized, saying she just wanted to help improve the team. I understood her intentions but asked if she could provide feedback to me privately instead. 

Sarah agreed, and we ended up having a constructive conversation about volleyball and teamwork. I also realized that she was just passionate about the game. As the season progressed, we both learned to communicate better, and I really appreciated her supportive side. The team ended up getting along great, and we had a lot of fun together.

I told her (16F) that I was not really a fan and would rather do something else, maybe grab a bite to eat or watch a different movie that we both liked.

She got really upset and said that I was being a downer and not supporting her. I tried to explain that just because I’m not interested in the movie doesn’t mean I can’t support her enjoyment. I suggested that she could go with someone else who might be more into it, but she insisted that she wanted me to come along.

Then I felt pressured and agreed to go, despite my reluctance. When we got to the theater, I ended up sitting there feeling bored and uncomfortable, while she was excited and laughing at the movie. I realized that I should have just been honest from the start about not wanting to go. 

After the movie, she seemed a little cold towards me, and I asked her if she was upset. She said she was disappointed that I didn’t have fun and felt like I ruined the experience for her. I didn't mean to ruin it, but I really just didn’t enjoy the film at all.

My best friend and I have known each other for over a decade and usually do everything together, but I noticed that he had been quite distant lately.

In our team meetings, we all contributed ideas on how to make the event successful. One of my friends, let’s call her Sarah, suggested we create a bake sale alongside the event. Everyone loved the idea, and we all agreed to bring baked goods to help raise more money.

As the event approached, I noticed that Sarah was stressing out a lot about her baking. She kept saying she wanted everything to be perfect and was having a hard time deciding what to make. I offered to help her out, suggesting we bake together one day to ease some of her stress. She seemed grateful for the offer, and we set a date to bake.

However, the day before our baking day, Sarah told me she wasn’t feeling up to it and decided she would just buy some treats instead. I totally understood; we’ve all had those days where everything feels too overwhelming. But then, the day of the event, she showed up with store-bought cookies that didn’t look very special, and I could tell she felt a bit embarrassed. 

I had spent the whole day baking a variety of homemade goods, and I noticed that Sarah became more anxious as people complimented my treats. During the event, she pulled me aside and asked if I could pretend that we baked together, saying she was worried about how her store-bought cookies would be perceived compared to my homemade ones. I could tell she was upset and didn’t want to hurt her feelings, but I also felt uncomfortable with the idea of not being honest about who made what.

In the end, I told her that I appreciated her feelings, but I thought it would be better if we were transparent about who baked what. We ended up agreeing to just celebrate the fact that we both contributed to the event, even if in different ways. After the event, Sarah thanked me for being understanding and we talked about how we could plan better next time.

I’ve always been somewhat introverted and prefer smaller gatherings with close friends, while my partner thrives in larger social settings and enjoys hosting parties. Over the past few months, he has been planning more frequent get-togethers, which I have reluctantly agreed to attend. I try to support him because I know how much he enjoys being around people, but I often find myself feeling drained afterward.

Recently, we had a big party at our house for one of his friends’ birthdays. I helped with the setup but mentally prepared myself to retreat to a quiet corner once the party was in full swing. When the time came, I did just that—I spent some time chatting with a few people, but then I excused myself to the bedroom to have some downtime. My partner noticed and later expressed that he felt I wasn’t being supportive. He said it made him uncomfortable to have me disappear while everyone was having fun.

I understand where he’s coming from, but I also need to take care of my own mental health. I didn’t want to be a party pooper, but I also didn’t want to force myself to stay in the crowd and feel overwhelmed. After discussing it, we both realized that while we have different needs in social situations, neither of us is wrong for feeling how we do.

Last Saturday, my parents were out running errands, and my brother asked if I could help him practice hitting. I was in the middle of working on a painting that I had planned for weeks, and I really wanted to finish it that day because I had an art contest coming up. I told him that I couldn’t help him at that moment and suggested he go practice on his own or ask one of his friends.

He seemed disappointed, and I felt bad. I didn’t want him to think I was ignoring him, but I also needed to prioritize my own commitments. After a little while, I heard him outside, swinging the bat and missing a lot. It broke my heart a bit to hear him struggle, so I decided to step outside and watch him for a bit. 

When I joined him, he looked up and grinned. I ended up giving him a few tips and we practiced together for about half an hour. I was glad I took the time to help him, but I also felt a bit stressed about my painting deadline. 

Later that day, my parents came home and asked about our practice session. I told them I helped him for a bit, but mostly how I needed to focus on my own stuff. They were supportive, but I couldn’t help but feel like I let my brother down initially by not being there right away.

I tried to explain my situation and how hard it is for me to be in those kinds of environments. Sarah was understanding, but she also expressed disappointment. She mentioned how much it would mean to her to have all her close friends there and how she hoped I would reconsider.

He prefers to keep things small and intimate, whereas my friend and I love big parties and celebrating with all our friends.

When it came time to plan her engagement party, my friend confided in me that her fiancé wanted to have a small get-together with just a handful of people. She was feeling conflicted because she knows I love throwing big parties and she also enjoys that atmosphere. I suggested that maybe we could find a compromise, like having a small gathering but with some fun activities to make it feel more festive. I offered to help organize it, thinking it would make her happy to have both styles represented.

Unfortunately, when I brought it up to her fiancé, he completely shut down the idea, insisting that it was his way or no way. My friend was visibly upset but felt stuck since it was important to her fiancé. I didn’t want to create tension, so I backed off and suggested just focusing on what he wanted.

So, this happened recently, and I think I might need some outside perspective. I (28F) work in a small office with about 10 people, and we have an open layout. I’ve been there for a little over three years, and we all generally get along well.

One of my coworkers, Sarah (32F), just came back from maternity leave after having her first child. We’re all excited to have her back, and she seems happy too. However, there’s been a bit of a change in our office dynamic since she returned. Sarah has been bringing her baby into the office with her occasionally, which I totally understand since she’s still in the early stages of adjusting to being a new mom. 

The thing is, Sarah’s baby tends to cry quite a bit, especially when she’s trying to work or have meetings. I know this is a normal part of being a parent, and I genuinely sympathize with her. However, the crying has made it challenging for me and a few other coworkers to concentrate during the day, especially when we’re in the middle of tasks that require focus.

One day, when the baby was crying non-stop during a conference call, I made a comment to Sarah, suggesting that it might be better for her to take the baby to the wellness room or work from home when it’s too disruptive. I thought I was being supportive by offering a solution, but Sarah seemed really hurt by my suggestion. She later told me that she feels like she’s being judged for bringing her baby to work and that she’s trying her best to balance everything.

Now I feel bad. I didn’t mean to make her feel that way, and I understand that being a new parent is tough.

When I arrived, I noticed that his family had a large dog, a golden retriever, who was very friendly and seemed to be an integral part of their lives. They called him Max.

Throughout our stay, I noticed that while Max received a lot of attention, he also seemed to be very restless, especially during the evenings. My friend’s family explained that Max had been a part of their family for years but was getting older and had some health issues. They mentioned that he had been diagnosed with arthritis and that they were managing his condition with some natural supplements.

However, I also noticed that Max was having trouble getting up and moving around, especially when he wanted to join us outside. He seemed to struggle with stairs and needed help to get onto the deck. I could see how much my friend and his family cared for him, but I couldn't shake the feeling that he might need more specialized care or perhaps some better accommodations.

During dinner, I brought up my concerns about Max's mobility. I suggested that they might want to consider consulting a vet who specializes in geriatric care for dogs, as I had heard about some therapies that could help improve his quality of life. My friend’s family seemed a bit taken aback and thanked me for my concern but also expressed that they were doing what they could for Max within their budget and that he was still happy.

I felt a bit awkward after that, as it was clear they were doing their best and I didn’t want to overstep. I realized I was coming from a place of wanting the best for Max, but I also didn’t want to make my friend’s family feel judged for how they care for their pet.

After the trip, I couldn’t help but wonder if I should have spoken up, or if I was being too pushy with my opinions. Would I be the asshole if I suggested they look into more comprehensive care for Max?",810,2845,0.97,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_34849,2020-02-22 00:00:00,NAH,2014,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I'm 17 and my best friend, Sarah, recently started dating someone new. I’m really happy for her, but I’ve noticed that she’s been spending all her time with him and hasn’t been as available to hang out with me. I understand that new relationships can be consuming, but it feels like I’m losing my best friend.

A few weeks ago, I invited her to a movie night that we used to have every month. She initially said yes, but the day of, she texted me saying her boyfriend wanted to do something that night instead. I was disappointed but tried to be understanding. I told her it was fine and that we could plan for another time.

Later that week, I ended up seeing some posts on social media where Sarah and her boyfriend were out doing things that she used to do with me. It hurt to see her going out without me, especially since I felt like I was being pushed to the side. I messaged her saying that I missed our time together and hoped she could make more time for me despite her new relationship.

When we finally met up, she seemed a bit defensive. She said she was juggling a lot and that she didn't mean to neglect our friendship. I realized that I may have come off as jealous or accusatory, which was not my intention at all. I just wanted to express how I felt without making her feel bad about her new relationship. We ended up talking it out, and I think we both understood where the other was coming from.

In the end, I don't think either of us did anything wrong. We both care about each other but are trying to navigate this new dynamic. So, AITA for expressing my feelings about our friendship?",98,541,0.64,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_19226,2021-09-03 00:00:00,NAH,1607,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I (28M) have a younger sister (24F) who’s been dating her boyfriend (26M) for about two years now. They seem really happy together, and I’ve always supported their relationship. Recently, though, my sister had a family gathering at her place, and her boyfriend was invited. 

The gathering went smoothly, and we were all enjoying ourselves until my sister mentioned she had a surprise for everyone. She revealed that she had been planning a small engagement party for the two of them, and that they were officially engaged. Everyone was thrilled, and we celebrated. 

In the moment, I was genuinely happy for her, but I also noticed that her boyfriend seemed a bit off. He wasn't as enthusiastic as I expected, and after a while, I pulled him aside to ask if everything was alright. It turned out he felt overwhelmed by the sudden announcement and the pressure that came with it. He also mentioned that he hadn’t planned to propose just yet, and he felt somewhat rushed into this engagement because of the way my sister presented it.

I could see how this was weighing on him, so I suggested that he take some time to think things through, and maybe they could have a more private conversation about their future. He thanked me for understanding and agreed.

Later that night, I had a heart-to-heart with my sister. I told her about my conversation with her boyfriend and encouraged her to talk openly about their feelings regarding the engagement. I explained that while I’m excited for her, it’s important to have mutual agreement on such a significant step.

My sister was initially upset with me for bringing it up but eventually appreciated my honesty. She hadn’t realized her boyfriend might be feeling pressured and agreed to have a candid discussion with him.

In the end, they had a great conversation, and it turns out they both decided to take their time and enjoy their relationship without the pressure of an engagement right now. 

I still feel a bit conflicted about whether I should have said anything at all. On one hand, I wanted to look out for my sister and her boyfriend, but I also don’t want to overstep. So, AITA for suggesting to my sister’s boyfriend that he take time to think about the engagement?",791,1815,0.68,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_14249,2019-08-07 00:00:00,NAH,2225,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"I'm looking for some perspective on a situation that happened recently.  

I have a close friend, Sarah, who has been going through a tough time after a breakup. She’s been feeling really down and has expressed to me that she wants to focus on self-care and healing before jumping back into dating. I completely respect that, and I've been trying to be supportive by checking in on her and suggesting activities that might lift her spirits.  

A few weeks ago, I was invited to a party where I knew a lot of single people would be attending. I thought it might be a good opportunity for Sarah to meet some new people and get out of her head for a bit. I casually mentioned the party to her, hoping she might consider joining me. She was really clear, though, that she wasn’t ready to be around that kind of environment yet.  

I completely understood and didn’t press her further. However, I ended up going to the party and having a good time, but I let my other friends know that Sarah was taking a break from dating and focused on herself. They were really respectful of that and didn’t try to push her into anything.  

After the party, I did mention to Sarah that I had gone and had a good time, but I made sure to emphasize that I understood her decision to avoid those kinds of situations right now. She seemed a bit upset that I had gone without her, but I assured her I didn’t want to pressure her or make her feel bad about her choices.  

Looking back, I wonder if it was wrong of me to go to the party at all, considering her feelings. I didn’t want her to feel abandoned, but I also wanted to have some fun and maintain my social life. Was I inconsiderate for attending, or is it okay for friends to have their own lives while still supporting each other? I'm just trying to figure out if I handled this situation appropriately or if I should have acted differently.",85,2057,0.52,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_29128,2023-10-30 00:00:00,NAH,1878,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"My coworker, Sarah, is generally a wonderful person and a great team player, but she has a habit of overcommitting herself. She’s always volunteering for extra projects and taking on more responsibilities than she can handle, and it often leads to her feeling overwhelmed and stressed out. As a result, she sometimes misses deadlines or has to rush through her work, which can affect the rest of the team.

Recently, we had a project with a tight deadline, and Sarah had volunteered to lead it. I could see she was already swamped with her other responsibilities, but she insisted that she could manage. When the deadline approached, it became clear that she was struggling. I tried to offer help, but she brushed it off, insisting that she wanted to do it all herself. 

In the end, she submitted the project late, and it didn’t meet the quality we usually strive for. During our team meeting to discuss the project, I gently suggested that maybe she should consider delegating tasks or being more selective about what she takes on in the future. I thought I was being supportive, but she seemed really upset and defensive, saying that she’s just trying to contribute more to the team.

I feel torn because I care about Sarah and want to help her avoid this kind of stress, but I also understand that she has her own way of doing things and might not want my input. I don’t think I approached the situation in a harsh way, but I’m starting to feel guilty for saying anything at all. AITA for suggesting to my coworker that she shouldn’t take on so much work?",665,2545,1.0,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_70920,2018-09-20 00:00:00,NAH,1559,AITA
No one is the Asshole,"Last weekend, I was hanging out at a local coffee shop where I often go to read and relax. It was a busy Saturday, and the place was packed. I noticed a group of teenagers sitting at a table nearby, and they were being quite loud and disruptive. I could hear their conversations, which included some inappropriate jokes and a lot of laughter.

After a while, I decided to politely ask them to keep it down since I was trying to focus on my book. I approached their table and said, “Hey, I’m really sorry to interrupt, but it’s a bit hard for me to concentrate with all the noise. Would you mind keeping it down just a little?” 

They looked surprised but nodded in agreement. I returned to my table, feeling good about having addressed the issue calmly. However, a few minutes later, I overheard one of them say, “Who does that old guy think he is?” and they all started laughing again, clearly mocking me.

I felt a bit hurt but also understood that teenagers can be a bit thoughtless and sometimes mean. I didn’t confront them again, but I mentioned it to the barista, who said they would keep an eye on the situation.

I think everyone had a role in this: I was trying to enjoy my time and asked them nicely to be quieter, while they responded immaturely but didn't escalate the situation. So, I’m wondering whether I handled the situation well or if I was being too sensitive given their reactions. Am I the asshole for speaking up, or was it a reasonable request?",667,2964,0.91,AITA RANDOM TITLE,post_37611,2020-02-22 00:00:00,NAH,1468,AITA
