18143,No A-holes here,"I really don’t know what to say. I’m at a loss for words.
 
I sorta recently proposed to my GF. Everything is going sorta good. We were just watching a documentary about the diamond trade. The concept of synthetic diamonds came up. I actually mentioned to her, that that’s how her ring was made. Then, she got a bit disappointed. She keeps on calling it fake, which it’s not. It’s chemically and physically the same as any other diamond.
 
She says that she feed betrayed. I don’t know how or why she feels like that. Again, it’s not like it was cheap. $300 is a pretty low price, though. Also, I’m not supporting the very shady diamond trade.
 
So, AITA?",1204,14340,0.94,AITA for getting my fiancée a “fake” diamond ring?,g805ko,2020-04-25 19:56:28,NAH,655,AITA,"The author recently proposed to their girlfriend and mentioned that her engagement ring is a synthetic diamond, which caused her to feel disappointed and betrayed, as she perceives it to be ""fake.""

3971,Not the A-hole,"So, as a preface this happened last month. Also, my first post:I went camping with a few friends that were in town. We were camping for one night and hiking the next day. There were 5 of us total, me and two couples. We all decided that we would let one person buy all the food and split the food costs evenly. This was one dinner meal, one breakfast meal, some snacks, and beer. When we arrived (I should also note, I drove 3 hours each way in my car in the Rocky Mountains) I asked the friend who purchased the food, lets call him James, how much I owed them in the split, and they said evenly it would be $50.

Now, I'm no scrooge and I'm always happy to pay my fair share, but I felt that this was a little steep considering we were eating burgers, pancakes, and drinking coors lite for only one night. I asked to see a receipt. Turns out, the bill for everything was $150, and we just had a lot of nicer products. Jame's wife is a vegetarian and had her own separate food included in the bill, and I'm happy to help with her food as well, but it definitely added to the cost.Here is where I take issue. The bill was split 3 ways, 1/3 James and his wife, 1/3 the other couple, 1/3 me by myself. My wife was not with us because she had to work, and I felt that it was unfair that I was expected to cover 1/3 the bill while the other two paid ""as a couple"" instead of individually.

I was bothered by this and brought it up, explaining that it wasn't exactly even, but I was told by both couples that it made sense to them. Their logic was because James was paying, and the other male was paying, the women shouldn't have to. Normally, I'd be chivalrous and agree, but my wife wasn't there, so I don't think that it makes sense. I offered to pay $30, which would have been 1/5 the costs instead of 1/3, but they all said I was being ridiculous.

Am I the asshole for not agreeing with this split?

6735,Not the A-hole,"Basically my girlfriend (20F) and I (20F) went on holiday with another couple who are her friends.
 In the middle of the night I awoke to hearing the couple arguing or something and the girl being hurt in some way (saying “ouch, stop” etc).
I tried to ignore it until she came out crying and I confronted the guy which nearly resulted in a fist fight and we ended up falling out. I left the situation to another hotel with my gf and me and him did not associate for the rest of the holiday.

Flash forward a few months and my gf went to their house and they tried to instigate a threesome. The girl in their relationship justified it by saying “he doesn’t want it out of lust it’s another reason I can’t tell you” which is very obviously because he hates me. (It’s blatantly obvious)
The threesome didn’t happen and the girls fell out because he told my gf she was sexy or something in private and she didn’t relay the info to his girlfriend. 

When she told me about it I told her I don’t want to hear of them ever again, and she agreed.
Recently the girls met up with mutual friends and ended up becoming friends again.
I told her I won’t have them people anywhere near my life.

My argument is basically what team are we if she’s friends with people who tried to do something for the purpose of hurting me? And if a girl tried to have sex with me out of hatred for her it would be a completely different story.

Her argument is that I am controlling her by not letting her be friends with who she wants, and I create drama by creating random vendettas against her friends

I’m not going to change my mind and I’m doubtful she will either, we both clearly have different ideas of what a relationship should be.

19984,Asshole,"Our neighbours are quite a noisy family of five kids (the oldest being about 10) and our family has been quite accommodating towards them. We helped sort out their garden, given them several toys and playhouses my brother grew out of and have been generally nice.

Recently, we were inspired by a few lovely families in our neighbourhood to leave a box of (sanitised) toys and books for other children stuck at home in the lockdown because we understood how difficult it could be. An hour or two into our box being put outside, our neighbours had carried the entire box inside with them, including a few YA books with a 17+ description. We have felt this is extremely selfish, the children were in no way going to read or benefit from those books and we had planned for the toys to be shared to more than one family so everyone could benefit. The children have also been distressing my autistic brother and tricking him into throwing his own toys over the fence as they claim the toys are 'theirs', so I may be biased on the situation.

Said family has also left to go to the seaside during the strictest part of quarantine and invited several people from other households into their house without social distancing measures. We were quite keen on these toys going to families who hadn't been able to do such things because they were following government advice or had to isolate for health conditions, such as myself and my dad.

I've been telling my mother that she needs to slow down and that she's gonna end up like my father if she keeps continuing like this. She's told me that I'm just nagging her and that since she's my mother, I shouldn't worry about her.

That was going on for 2 to 3 years, or so. (started when I was 13.) She's a full-blown alcoholic. (Even more than before my dad died.) This year, I've been worried about her. She drinks too much, so I try to hide her booze and dump it. (In an attempt to make her slow down on the alcohol.)

I've been doing this for months. She thinks I'm drinking it all, (even though I won't touch the stuff.) and blaming me for drinking her missing booze. Even when she **DOES** actually drink it all. She [pulls a Patrick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR8-K7ocZbo).

I confronted her about this, and she made it seem like I was the asshole since ""She raised me."" therefore if I think anything different, ""I'm being an asshole and abusing her.""

I told her that I hate living in this environment and that if I was living somewhere else, I would be better off physically, and mentally. I told her I wish I moved to my grandfather's, in Idaho, and I hated living with her in California.

**She took great offense to this.**

She told me that I was emotionally abusing her, being an asshole to her since I was a kid and that I shouldn't say stuff like that since she's BELIEVES she's a ""great parent"".

My mom was raised in a very...interesting household to say the least. She was raised in a very typical Middle Eastern way, my grandmother was (and still is) very strict with her. Therefore, when my mom had me she wanted to raise me differently than she had been. 


We barely went to see my grandparents and my mom claims no connection to that part of her heritage. As a result, I haven't had any connection either. 


Over the past year or so I've been wanting to change that though. I've been cooking traditional Iranian foods, have been teaching myself Farsi, and just been learning about the culture in general. (I am not Muslim or even religious at all if that's something important to include).

2789,No A-holes here,"My husband and I host parties with our friends a few times a year.  During the last two parties, our friend “Craig” has knocked his drink over.

The first time, the drink in question was blue (I make a mean blue margarita).   It made a helluva mess.  It was late (around 1:30 a.m.), and my husband and I were really pissed (although we hid it as best we could).  We were super tired, and cleaning that blue shit off our carpet was the last thing we felt like doing.

The second time was last night.    This time, it was an almost full rum and coke.    The mess wasn’t as terrible to clean up, but this time the glass was almost full, so it covered our table, carpet, AND MY PHONE.   Luckily, my phone survived, and we were abele to clean everything up.

Both times, Craig expressed dismay, helped clean up, but didn’t say he was sorry for the mess.   Frankly, that pissed me and my husband off.

This morning, I looked online and found a collection of spill proof adult sippy cups for sale.  There would be enough for my husband, me, Craig, his wife, and the other two friends who usually come to our parties.    Would I be the asshole if I bought them and used them at the next party?  I could say “Hey, people sometimes get a little clumsy when they’ve had a few.   Believe me, I’ve been there.   These will prevent any possible future mishaps!”

Craig will undoubtedly know that I’ve bought them because of him.   I don’t want to make him feel bad, but I also don’t want our carpets to suffer again.    So, WIBTA?

So, I usually shower in the morning before getting dressed, but on days I have a workout class or a hike in the morning, I wait until AFTER working out to shower. This is probably only once a week or so - I'm no athlete. I still obviously brush my teeth, etc, before leaving the house. 


My argument for this is that taking two showers within a couple hours is terrible for your hair and skin.  Also, why would you shower right BEFORE getting dirty and stinky? It's seems like a waste of time.  I'm not a particularly sweaty or stinky person overall, so I'm not (in my opinion) gross or smelly when I begin my workout, just at the end. I have a desk job, so I'm not getting particularly dirty throughout the day. I still feel perfectly okay to be seen in public before my morning shower, so I don't think I'm offending people with my foul odor or anything by going on a hike or fitness class pre-shower.

15077,Not the A-hole,"As per most reddit posts, this one has years of backstory but I'll do my damndest to keep under the character limit. My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. 

Last year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just ""took advantage"" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. 

I know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to ""work it out"" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. 


My dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me ""tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him"" and stuff like that. 

With that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side.

13517,Not the A-hole," 

This has been a reoccurring problem and I never really confronted her on it until now.

So this morning, I wake up early to drive my girlfriend to one of her final exams. On our way out the door, she tells me we are gonna take her friends too. No problem, they live at the same apartment complex and I have plenty of room. (Keep in mind I drive my girlfriend \[and her friends\] to school nearly every day when she is perfectly capable of walking (15-20 min walk) or taking the bus that drives directly from our apartment complex to campus. She reciprocates sometimes, but its usually a problem/argument - still, not a big deal. She is way busier than I am so I get it.) Today, we get in my car and when I turn the engine on, she comments in a \[probably lighthearted\] way ""WOW oh my god I hate this song. 156843 always plays songs that I hate just to annoy me."" -no big deal. Slight chuckle from those in the back. Usually when she makes people laugh she tries harder to do so again and so then she says ""did you all like my video of 156843 yelling at the computer last night?"" Story: I had a few beers yesterday afternoon/evening and was playing a certain FPS game (BF3) that I hadn't played in months (I don't have time for gaming anymore) and I got really into it and was jokingly yelling at the game. she was laughing at it but then also decided to send a video of me doing it to her snapchat group of friends (same ones I drove to school this morning). When she says this in the car on the ride over I make a quick joke about it (kinda laughing at my self for doing it) and then shake it off. On the way over we almost get hit from someone driving like a maniac and switching lanes at the last moment as I am taking a right at a red light. She then comments something along the lines of ""we might make it there but itll cost a few lives"" and ""156843 is just trynna kill us this morning"". We had to take a detour to avoid traffic and she commented ""OMG where are we going??!"" Again, no big deal. I arrive at campus, and I realize this is a bit ridiculous and I get slightly annoyed at how she tries to always get a few laughs at my expense in front of her friends. Instead of calling her out in front of her friends, I wait until they get out, then send her a text:

""You act different around your friends""

Her: ""What do you mean?"" - Within 10 sec after receiving this she calls me. I tell her ""You act very differently around your friends and sometimes you try to make them laugh at my expense. Not a big deal, just a little annoying sometimes.""

I guess this triggers her and she is now accusing me of calling her annoying and distracting her before her exam. She said that she wont talk to me until I apologize to her. We had an exchange over text which might or might not be relevant. If it'll help I can post a transcript.

10580,Not the A-hole,"This happened about 4 years ago. I was there in my capacity as a mystery shopper: think of me like an undercover hotel critic that produces an internal review for the hotel owners: I wasn't leaving a nasty yelp review.

I was reviewing an upscale ""boutique"" hotel in the Hamptons, where the rooms were costing me $500 a night (not that I was paying out of pocket, but that shows you the clientele whose mindset I was trying to put myself into). The hotel was in a converted summer camp with bungalows and a ""rustic"" theme. One thing that was advertised on their website was that every room came with a grill for barbecuing. So when I came to check in, I brought some meat with me to BBQ since I hadn't done so in a while.

To my surprise, while the grills were advertised online, there was no charcoal or fuel. When I went to the front desk to ask for some, the woman running the front desk seemed surprised, and then recommended me a store nearby where I could buy some. I mentioned that it was a long walk away, and she offered to let me rent a bike free of charge to go there.

I've reviewed plenty of luxury hotels in this job, and for $500 a night I would expect them to stock charcoal so I could grill if it's advertised on the website. And if they *didn't*, they should have sent someone to a store or supplier to go get me some, without my asking. I did notice that there only seemed to be one bellman or porter for the entire hotel, and very little staff overall. To be clear: I am perfectly capable of riding a bike to the store and buying charcoal, but while I was *mildly* miffed that it wasn't available or provided to me for free (or as part of a resort fee) I would imagine the target clientele might be *more* pissed.

In my internal review, I was asked if the staff fulfilled my needs and I said no. I later polled a few other people in my industry, and people seemed split down the middle about whether it was reasonable to expect charcoal be provided, that if it wasn't provided someone should've gone to the store *for* me, and if whether or not suggesting a store and offering a bicycle for me to buy my own charcoal ""fulfilled my needs.""

I argued that if I were paying Ritz prices in the Hamptons I should've been given free charcoal or, at the very least, offered something like a free meal in the hotel restaurant because I couldn't cook my own food.",290,1733,0.93,AITA for leaving a bad review for a luxury hotel that didn't offer to fetch something for me?,c0voh1,2019-06-15 09:50:11,NTA,2375,AITA,"Four years ago, as a mystery shopper reviewing an upscale boutique hotel in the Hamptons, I encountered an issue with a missing amenity that was advertised online: the grills in the rooms lacked charcoal or fuel.

6842,Not the A-hole,"I know it sounds horrible but hear me out. Fuck I'm still livid from this. Luckily it was only $4.24 which I won't lose sleep over but anything above 10 if this happened I would have pushed to get the fare waived.

So it's 12:30 am, had a fun night, tired and wanna go home, I'm maybe a 15-20 minute walk from home but decide to Uber it, and since I'm not in a crazy rush I go for the Uber Pool to save money, after all I'm only a 5 minute ride from home anyway.

And yeah, I'm well-aware the pool can be wonky sometimes. It connects me to this driver who it says is 5 minutes away. Of course, with the pool I know that's not always accurate because anyone can pick it up. Okay.

So I start to see him go in the opposite direction to pick up ""Charlotte"". Alright, so be it. He's lingering for a bit in circles in an area 5-7 minutes away, eventually her name disappears.

But then... in the next 10 minutes (yes, 10), I watch him continue going in the opposite direction... towards the other side of town. No more names appear in this time. He keeps moving further and further away... and becomes twice as far away from me as he was when he picked up ""Charlotte"". I consider cancelling and ordering again, but don't want to deal with the cancellation fee, so I try calling him.

After the second attempt, I finally get him and give him a demanding earful - ""hey dude, it's succulentboobs, what's going on?! I've been waiting at the corner of [location] almost 20 minutes, I've just seen you going in the opposite direction, what's the deal?""

He just responds with ""okay I'm on my way"".

Sure enough, he turns around immediately and comes to get me. I'm prepared to pummel him with questions, but when he finally gets here there's another girl in there and he seems chill ad briefly apologizes so I decide to let it go and not cause a scene.

But then, as he's going in my direction, right halfway to my house, he drops off the girl and says ""have a good night Charlotte"". I was ready to let it go, but this just raised the question - if this girl was in fact Charlotte and going in the same direction as me, then WHY the blooming hell was he going in the opposite direction from there for over five minutes straight after he picked her up? Especially when he was supposed to pick me up at a place that was directly on the way! And furthermore, why did I have to call him to get him to actually come in my direction? It seems like that's what got him to turn around and he wouldn't have otherwise.

So I confront him about this - turns out Charlotte was also having him pick up her friend and get them somewhere (off the grid, which explains why I didn't see any names), and when I asked him why he's prioritizing that over his actual orders - he actually straight up admitted that he forgot I was even there as a pending order and my call reminded him. He apologized but I told him that's not cool and reminded him how long I was waiting, and... you know the rest.

Sometimes I fall asleep. If the light in my room is on at 5 am, my family thinks I've slept and sometimes come in to switch it off. I'm usually sleeping in an uncomfortable position (sitting with books open, etc) 

This time my Grandmother came in to switch off the light and apparently she saw me wearing a tank top. Now, I usually work in a sports bra cause it's more comfortable but I was in a hurry and wore whatever looked comfy. But, I swear if she saw me in a sports bra, hell would unleash.

He seems to ruin everything we try and do as a family, threatens with violence (held a knife to his own throat because he was grounded from playing video games), and treats my parents like slaves.

I can't stand hearing him berate my mom with demands and horrible comments, but when I call him out on it, she gets on to me. I am in debate and theatre, and my parents have to miss my performances, award ceremonies, and even being recognized in front of hundreds of people for helping a Cub Scout Troop cross over into my Boy Scout troop with more achievements than this troop had ever seen before because they cannot leave him at home. He has tried to run away into the woods at church and wouldn't come back to the car until 30 minutes later when my dad carried him back while he was getting hit, kicked, and clawed by the demon.

My parents do everything in their power to try and help, and believe me, they are astonishing parents, but he spits everything back in their faces. Even on Christmas Day he yelled at me because I made a joke about a cat dying in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. I forgot to mention, the only thing he cares about besides electronics and his great grandmother is animals. They tried taking him to equine therapy, but he refused to go. Even behavioral therapists gave up on him.

I can't go in the living room, it's a warzone.

3458,Asshole,"I (28 M) was cooking a homemade dinner for me and my girlfriend (24 F). Nothing too fancy, homemade fettuccine Alfredo and some homemade garlic bread. We’ve lived together in an apartment for about a year now, and we get along great 99.9999% of the time. 

I had spent about half an hour cooking at this point, and the bread was running a bit behind. The pasta was about halfway done, and I hadn’t even started the bread, so I start preheating the oven as I prep the bread and continue watching the sauce and pasta. I admit, my lack of preparation was a fail, but I thought I could save it. 

The oven had preheated right as I finished prepping the bread, and the pasta still had another few minutes to go, so I’m thinking, “hell yeah, I can totally get this bread a little toasty as I drain the pasta and prep the plates.” I open the oven, and I see this red silly putty looking goop covering the inside of the oven and my glass lasagna pan filled with this red goop. 

As I realize what I was witnessing wasn’t some alien silly putty, I yell, “what the?!?”

 “Goddamnit...”

“You put..” I couldn’t finish my sentences due to the shock.

My girlfriend ran up and said, “What?”

In an annoyed and flabbergasted tone, I finally finish my sentence, “you put plastic in the oven?”

“This oven is probably ruined now, and I’m going to have to pay for it when we move out” I continued.

My girlfriend replied with, “don’t act like it’s my fault, you’re the one who turned on the oven without checking it first.”

At which point I responded, “I shouldn’t have to check the oven because plastic never should have been in there in the first place.”

My girlfriend got angry and said I was an asshole for trying to entirely blame her. I told her I wasn’t necessarily trying to blame her, but that we should both agree not to put plastic in the oven.

15893,Not the A-hole,"I'm 27f and my husband is 30. We tried for a few years to have baby, long story short, it didn't work out and we ended up going through a couple rounds of IVF.

Fast forward. We find out we're pregnant and we are super happy, like over the moon ecstatic.  We couldn't wait for the 12 week mark to tell people, and started working on a nursery right away.

However, we go to our scan and find out we are having FOUR babies. Four. That's insane. I'm cutting a lot of backstory out because honestly, it's hard for me to talk about. At the time, my husband and I are just in shock, but happy we have healthy babies.

Now, I'm a small woman, 5'0 and very petite. At my next scan, it was suggested I consider aborting two of the pregnancies for the sake of my body, and to be honest, I was quietly considering bringing this idea up to my husband anyway because of the money involved with raising four children. We could afford two babies, but no way could we afford four.

Me and my husband are distraught that this is our reality, but we went home and tried to figure it out. From our latest scan, we know we have identical twin girls and two fraternal boys in there. If we go through with the selective abortion, which we most likely will, I brought up that I would like to keep the two girls as they are identical twins (I'm hoping they have the 'twin bond') and also, to be honest, I've always wanted girls.

My husband is on board with this, but as soon as I told my mother and sister the scenario they kicked off, calling us selfish, entitled, saying we are searching for designer babies, etc.

The way I see it is that we have to make a choice which babies go if we do this, and it breaks our hearts that we are in this position but we need to do what we can for the sake of our children. This story sounds so tragic, like a soap storyline or something but it's honestly the hardest thing I have ever done.

So, my question is both AITA for having a preference in this?

I woke up this morning with a really really bad cold. I'm talking migraine, can't breathe, no voice. It's a bad one. My oldest son also just got home yesterday from camp, and is exhausted today. 

I messaged my mom and said it would probably be best if we just had today to rest, and that we will see them tomorrow anyway. She replied, ""Haha. See you in a few!""

So I replied ""Mom, I really am sick. Please wait to see us until tomorrow. We need the day to recover.""

16855,Not the A-hole,"I volunteer at the womans center at the university I attend, the other student is one of the paid (student) staff at the center

&#x200B;

I am an ex sex worker - she knows this.

&#x200B;

December we discuses fund-raising, one of the fund-raisers was for a local shelter that deals with sex workers. She was very vocally against this saying ""we are supposed to be for women, not people like that, they know what they are getting into and deserve everything they get."" One of the other volunteers spoke up about how often sex workers were assaulted, she said that she doesn't care and repeated that they knew what they were getting into, and that it took away from real assault victims like \*\*her\*\*. At this point I spoke up saying that I was feeling attacked as she just blamed me for my assault. She immediately back peddled and claimed that ""this is just my belief about ""those women"" and that she didn't mean \*\*me\*\*.nope, can't say sex worker and not mean me. She then said she has the right to her opinion, but I have to understand that she didn't mean it that way. She apologized for me ""taking her wrong"", it's BS and I'm not happy.During this meeting she also sais that she would never be able to give pro-choice info because its against her beliefs (not a religious belief, she's an atheist), she didn't know it but someone present had an abortion. She was reminded that in the mandate we are a pro-choice center and she can't try and bully people out of their decisions. She said once again that this is just her belief and that she should be allowed to have whatever belief she wants but she will just have to leave her beliefs at the door. As we were all leaving the school, she stops me in the main area and demands I forgive her and give her a hug in font of about 30 students, knowing that if I said no I would look like an asshole.

I complained to the head of the center, but she is a student and doesn't have any control over anything. She brought it up to the school staff member that is in control of hiring and the budget, but so far nothing has been done about it.

My next step is to lodge a formal complaint against her. I been resistant in doing this because 1) I would have to come out as an ex-sex worker to more people and 2) I am a mature student in my 30's whereas she is in her early 20's and it kinda felt like complaining against a child

She has now applied to be head of the center and it looks like she'll get the job because sh'e manipulated the student union into backing her by saying we've discriminated against her by not allowing her beliefs (again not religious).

I am very afraid that she is going to say something to someone who has been through those things when they have come for support. If was younger and still in sex work when she said that to me it would have devastated me and I probably would not feel safe at the school.

Now, you need context about my sister. She is just two years younger than me. She always makes fun of how I do my makeup, what I wear, and what I like to do. If I try to stand up to her, she gets aggressive, and is not afraid to get somewhat violent. She also blames me for basically everything wrong in her life (mostly because my parents helping me a little bit with college stopped her from going to a specific private K-12 school she wanted to attend). And this isn't to the level of normal sibling fights. No, if I try to ignore her comments, she will literally keep going for HOURS until I feel like I'm going to lose my mind. She manipulates my parents so they can give her what she wants with her doing minimal work, and when I confront her about it, she calls ME the leech because of, again, college (despite all of the things I do to pay for most of it).

I sent out another email and spoke to as many people as I could (about 15 out of the 20 in my office). 

The next day I was feeling more positive. I left a note on my food again stating it was mine and to not touch it. Lunch time comes around again and my food is gone. I was pissed so I threw out everything that was in the fridge. 

No one technically knows it was me, as I haven’t admitted to doing it, just like the jerk off stealing my lunches hasn’t come forward.

14554,Not the A-hole,"I was at my best friend’s bachelorette last weekend. And according to her sister/MOH, I’ve ruined everything. I feel like shit about this whole situation, fwiw. Bride = B, groom’s sister = GS

Background: I was born in and am a citizen of a controversial country and where I live now. Said country has issues and the current government is shit. But there is also a lot of misinformation out there. I’m not here for a debate, so please don’t. I went back to do my required military service but was never in a position near combat. B and I have been friends since we were kids. 

She was cold most of the weekend but I figured it was because we had never met. The last night we were all fairly drunk and in a cab. A girl asked how you say something in my native language, and I did. GS rolled her eyes. I asked her “what?” She answers that it sounds a lot like her guy’s language, but “your people steal everything from them”. I say that’s because they’re the same language family. She rolls her eyes. 

We get back and start setting up a game of scrabble. She pulls the MOH into a side room and yells at her about inviting me.

We start the game. Rude comments the whole time. Finally, she makes a “joke” that’s just super offensive for historical reasons and I say “You know that’s not ok, right?” She gets really mad with me and I explain the history.

She answers that maybe we should stop doing bad things and we won’t be accused of stuff. I say that if a country does awful shit that doesn’t mean you get to bring back 500 year old genocidal propaganda. I add that I don’t want to talk politics.

GS says we are the new (group that committed genocide against us). GS also implies that everyone from Country deserves it happening again. I get mad and say that that is not ok, and she should be ashamed. And that there are ways to criticize Country without being a racist, and calling for genocide makes her more of a (genocidal group) than I’ll ever be. She says she can’t be racist because I’m white (I’m mixed), and that I probably committed war crimes. I say I was nowhere near anything like a combat role. She says was “supporting the genocide” and that we need to get out of (other group who also lives there)’s land.

21605,Not the A-hole,"Alright folks this is a bit of a big one, and I want to get an opinion on it.

So. I (F18) don’t have the most fantastic relationship with my mother. She was horrible to me for a long time, and constantly nitpicks everything I do and makes everything about her. For example; I ordered some snow gear for college, with the help of friends who live in the snow, and happened to receive it and open it around her. Immediately I was bombarded about the colors, how I didn’t need a snow jacket that thick and how she didn’t have that stuff when she lived in the snow, how I’m spoiled, etc. The same thing happened when I ordered my bedding (“why those colors” “those are the wrong sheets” “you don’t need two sets of sheets”). This is MY money that I’m spending. She is not contributing, as she hasn’t had a job for five years and spends her time doing God knows what. I have a job.

I’ve told her that her actions really bug me before, but she says it’s “just parenting”. It’s also been remarks throughout all of my life about EVERYTHING that I do, to the point that if I eat around her (which is rarely because she comments on my weight constantly) she adjusts the food on my plate with her fork so that it “looks right”. It drives me INSANE. She also has no boundaries, and I know that if she came with me, she’d rearrange everything I set up and force me to hug her every five minutes and refuse to leave when I asked her to (happened at a sleep away camp when I was in high school)

Originally, she told me that she wasn’t going to be flying to college with me because she has “better things to do”. Then I got some money from my grandmother to help me with expenses and suddenly she wants to come. “We” have to figure out plane tickets, “we” need to figure out when “we” need to get there. I don’t see any “we” situation here. She flips back and forth between “I’m not going with you” and “I need to go with you”. I don’t want her there at all.

Moving in is hard, though, and due to COVID, my school isn’t having students help each other like they do traditionally. So everyone’s on their own. I was talking about this with friends who are already in college to get advice, and one of them (F19, who I’m very close to) offered to come with me to help me move in. I said no, because a) I’m going to college on the other side of the US (think moving from Florida to Oregon), b) it’s a lot of time and effort that she’d be putting in, and c) I don’t think it’s fair to her. But she said she’s desperate to get out of her house and wants to help, so I’m starting to consider it.

I know my mother would throw a FIT. I’d get a ridiculous amount of crap from her about it, she’d pull out her crocodile tears about how I’m a horrible person how dare I disrespect her, on and on. She can’t handle any adult conversations (any time I try to say “hey I don’t like it when you do _________” she either explodes at me or starts sobbing and calling me names) so I know her reaction would be horrific.

10915,Not the A-hole,"About 5-6 months ago, I (18f) started having problems with my ears turning red and getting a lil warm. I scheduled an appointment with a dermatologist bc initially I thought it was allergies. Turns out it had to do with the cartilage in my ears rather than the skin. I was referred to a rheumatologist, for whom I had to go make another appointment for, but I couldn’t get in to see her for 3 weeks.

While I waited, my ears got worse. To the point where I can no longer leave my room anymore. I have to sit in my room all day, in the dark, in front of a fan, with ice packs strapped to my head because it’s that bad. The burning is excruciating and constant. I can numb it with ice packs, but only until they melt.

ALSO during this time, my sister (23f) began to experience lots of issues with cramps and pain in her abdomen. It turns out she has an ovarian cyst which is causing her pain whenever she has her period. I by no means discount that fact that she is in a lot of pain. She is very very vocal about how much it hurts. Here’s where I’m frustrated, however.

Once I finally get to the rheumatologist, she basically sits down and tells me that I have relapsing polychondritis. Which is a rare genetic autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the cartilage in the body. Since it’s so rare, they don’t know what triggers it, and treatment is mostly trial and error. They worry about long term because cartilage is everywhere in your body, including the heart and windpipe. If my body started to attack either of those, it could spell disaster. Basically, it could flare up in the wrong place at the wrong time and I could die at a young age because of it. The possibility of a flare up in my heart is a major concern, and I just learned all of this on Wednesday.

Meanwhile my sister is having issues with her cyst again, and is wailing and crying. For sure she is hurting, but also I just learned that I could die at any point. My parents have elected to skirt around that fact, and haven’t offered me a bit of comfort about it, instead focusing on my sister. I am forced (through pure necessity) to sit alone in my room all day long, every day, and have been for the last few weeks. I am extremely lonely. My parents make minimal effort to check on me. At most it’s a brief four sentence conversation and then they go right back upstairs to take care of my sister. Nobody comes to talk to me, nobody comes to see me, nobody sits with me.

Tonight I made it it upstairs to get some food, and I saw my mom in my sister’s room, lying on the bed with her, rubbing her back and comforting her. And seeing how much my mom was caring for my sister while also forgetting me made me feel jealous. I don’t doubt for a second that my sister is in a lot of pain.

My son would usually mention his friend and sometimes his girlfriend (whenever he wasnt around ) regularly during normal chit chat.


So today the curiousity got the better of me so I just went and asked ""what happened with your friend lately.""

Then he hesitates then admit that while his friend and her were in a relationship she was secretly having sex with my son THROUGHOUT THEIR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP FOR A YEAR !


I didnt want to believe that he could do something so cold like that until I got more upset and kept asking if it was true. He finally admitted it and it and showed me a conversation that he had with his friend on the day his friend found out about it admitting it to him.

Now the thing is is that his friend didnt find out about the cheating until AFTER they had broken up for unrelated reasons. My son said that it was his friends NEW girlfriend's friends were the ones to tell him. My son never did. Which made me mad.

16046,No A-holes here,"I got the idea a few weeks ago to prank my friends my pretending to be an ""Appletarian"", meaning somebody who only eats food products that are derived from apples and would only drink apple juice or apple cider. 

I told them them all that I had read on the internet that eating only apples was the healthiest thing for you. When I first told them they thought I was joking, but they underestimated how committed I would be to a joke. So, whenever in the presence of one of my friends (or friend-of-friends/coworkers/etc who knew them) I was very careful to only be seen eating apples or drinking apple juice/cider. 

Apples whole, apples diced, apple sauce, the inside of an apple pie, baked apples, candy apples with the chocolate shaved off, etc. 

Finally after about a week they bought that I had become an Appletarian. They started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. Some of them even got angry.

But I wanted to stick with the joke. Finally, after the end of 3 weeks, I walked into what I was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. 

They were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. Finally I started laughing hysterically. They were confused as hell so I told them I had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. I even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. 

I thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. My girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago I had ruined our date night when I told the waiter I only wanted apples because I was an Appletarian and had ""embarrassed her for a dumb joke"".

10580,Not the A-hole,"This happened about 4 years ago. I was there in my capacity as a mystery shopper: think of me like an undercover hotel critic that produces an internal review for the hotel owners: I wasn't leaving a nasty yelp review.

I was reviewing an upscale ""boutique"" hotel in the Hamptons, where the rooms were costing me $500 a night (not that I was paying out of pocket, but that shows you the clientele whose mindset I was trying to put myself into). The hotel was in a converted summer camp with bungalows and a ""rustic"" theme. One thing that was advertised on their website was that every room came with a grill for barbecuing. So when I came to check in, I brought some meat with me to BBQ since I hadn't done so in a while.

To my surprise, while the grills were advertised online, there was no charcoal or fuel. When I went to the front desk to ask for some, the woman running the front desk seemed surprised, and then recommended me a store nearby where I could buy some. I mentioned that it was a long walk away, and she offered to let me rent a bike free of charge to go there.

I've reviewed plenty of luxury hotels in this job, and for $500 a night I would expect them to stock charcoal so I could grill if it's advertised on the website. And if they *didn't*, they should have sent someone to a store or supplier to go get me some, without my asking. I did notice that there only seemed to be one bellman or porter for the entire hotel, and very little staff overall. To be clear: I am perfectly capable of riding a bike to the store and buying charcoal, but while I was *mildly* miffed that it wasn't available or provided to me for free (or as part of a resort fee) I would imagine the target clientele might be *more* pissed.

In my internal review, I was asked if the staff fulfilled my needs and I said no. I later polled a few other people in my industry, and people seemed split down the middle about whether it was reasonable to expect charcoal be provided, that if it wasn't provided someone should've gone to the store *for* me, and if whether or not suggesting a store and offering a bicycle for me to buy my own charcoal ""fulfilled my needs.""

I argued that if I were paying Ritz prices in the Hamptons I should've been given free charcoal or, at the very least, offered something like a free meal in the hotel restaurant because I couldn't cook my own food.",290,1733,0.93,AITA for leaving a bad review for a luxury hotel that didn't offer to fetch something for me?,c0voh1,2019-06-15 09:50:11,NTA,2375,AITA,"As a mystery shopper at a $500-a-night boutique hotel in the Hamptons, I experienced an issue with the advertised amenities, specifically the lack of provided charcoal for the advertised grills in the rooms.

Alright well, few years ago my parents were abusive asf. During high school we had this “ag science “ type of science and one of the requirements of the class was raising some type of farm animal. One of said options was a bunny so I’m like “hey bunnies are cute asf” so I went for the bunny. My parents had always hated animals so, then being them, they let my rabbits outside in 105 degree weather in Cali. (In a tiny 1x3foot cage for 2 fully grown rabbits) they started showing symptoms of having heat strokes but again, they wouldn’t let me bring them in or even touch them. Male bunny eventually died that summer from a heat stroke. 

Once I moved out I took my bunny with me and got a dog as well. 

Well, parents came to visit etc. they started complaining about just having my pets IN the house “that’s disgusting” “how do you live like this?” I’m like “ they’re trained, clean and healthy.” Mom was like “but the hair.?!” “No that’s disgusting, put them outside” 

Back when I lived with them they’re excuse for literally everything was, “my house my rules, the rabbit stays outside” “she’s literally panting hard asf....” “I don’t care, don’t bring that thing in here” 

So now my house my rules too I guess and was like “you want them outside? Cool, get the fuck out” she’s like “what?” I’m like “I don’t fucking know how you could ever think I’d pick you over them, you don’t like them? They mean a thousand times more than you do, either live with it or get the fuck out”

16720,Asshole,"Let me preface this that I quit my ph.D program out of choice. Why? I was a middle-of-the-pack student. For an average student like me, I stand little to no chance in landing a tenure-track position even at an ""average"" university. What awaited me was post-doc purgatory and adjunct teaching, where you make a \*pittance\* for the amount of education you have invested in yourself. Foreseeing this, I noped the fuck out and jumped to the job market.

&#x200B;

Enter my GF. She is a 28 years old Masters student in engineering. She has informed me on several occasions that she wants to pursue a Ph.D after graduating from her current program. I have been urging her to think twice about this momentous decision. Here are my arguments as to why I think a Ph.D is not good for her:

&#x200B;

1. The Ph.D department she wants to go to is not that highly-ranked. Landing a tenure-track position after graduating from there is a snowball chance in hell.

&#x200B;

2. You don't need a Ph.D in engineering to thrive in the professional/industrial job market.

&#x200B;

3. She has never been on the job market. How would she know she wouldn't like it?

&#x200B;

4. I don't think she knows what she's getting into. It's clear she hasn't thoroughly researched this career path. 

&#x200B;

5. She's not that young anymore. Do you really want to use your prime years for an endeavor with highly uncertain payoff? Even if you manage to get a job after, that's \~5 years of opportunity cost gone. That's \~5 years in which you could have been working because a Masters is perfectly \*sufficient\* already. 

&#x200B;

6. I don't think her personality is good for academia. She is a very quiet and somewhat passive. Teaching, competing for grants, going to conferences, and all that jazz would probably be tough for her. 

&#x200B;

7. Hell, if the Ph.D is really needed for her next promotion, what prevents her from going \*back\* to it after gaining some work experience on the job market first?

&#x200B;

Most importantly, though, it's that I see myself in her. I believe I was in her shoes 4 years ago. I do not want her to make the same mistake I did. 

&#x200B;

Now, here's where I could be the asshole:

&#x200B;

1. She's allowed to do whatever the fuck she wants. Maybe I can give her some (unsolicited?) advice, but it's not my purview to tell her what to do.

&#x200B;

2. The big one: I'm not that young anymore either. I'm also materialistic. Basically, I don't want a future in which my partner doesn't really contribute to the American Dream because she's still studying as an 30+ years old. If we are to share our life together, I'd want her to work. I'm scared of the uncertainty that her preferred career path brings.

&#x200B;

Because I legit care about her and \*because I want someone who can help me create the future I want\*, I've been trying to dissuade her from pursuing her goal.

We were texting as usual. At the next hotel, I called her again. My friend came into the shot, the mood changed and the call ended. We talked again later and she seemed ok so I figured, whatever was wrong might be about something going on at home. For the rest of the trip, I continued to call/message and all I received were curt responses. I took it as a hint that maybe she's forcing me not to talk and to go enjoy my trip (she's told me to do so before). Returning home, my GF is distant. I tell her about my trip, showed her all my photos and videos. Talked about my new friends and the hookups they got into. She then tells me she didn't know I was sharing rooms with my friend. I'm deadpan confused and she tells me not to play this surprised card on her. WTF. The trip took months to plan and I reminded her of the calls to the tour group, organizing and getting on the same flights, tour dates and accommodations. She said booking doesn't mean sharing a room.  I reminded about the docs but she said she didn't want to access them because it seemed like a private. She said it seemed that I was intentionally not telling her, that I was deceitful because I should have known her jealous tendencies would need me to spell it out for her. From her perspective, it led her to think I might be hiding more.

5472,Asshole,"Excuse bad English. About 3 months ago my 10 year old daughter begged me to let her learn piano, and  wouldn't take no for an answer. Since piano is too expensive I got her an electronic keyboard and signed her up for 6 months of keyboard lessons. The deal I made with her was that she was not allowed to give it up before 6 months and to practice 20 minutes a day, she agreed without thinking.


It turned out just as I expected, she got bored of it after 2 months and asked to stop the lessons. Ofcourse I turned it down and reminded her about our deal. She then started to make excuses to skip practice from time to time, often requiring me to remind her to practice extra time to make up for the times she skipped.


There is an upcoming school trip for my daughter and she is looking forward to it, it is a 3 days 2 nights trip. I told her that she can only go if she cleared the keyboard practice time she skipped previously. I can give her a break by not counting in the 3 days school trip, but even so she still has to practice the keyboard 1 hour a day to clear them all before the date.


She threw a fit after I made it clear that if she could not clear the practice time, she would not be going.

She was a bit hesitant at first, but I think it's gotten better as time went on. My stepdaughter has recently gone back to school, and she has a habit of leaving her school stuff everywhere. Even though she has a desk in her room, she'll sometimes choose to do her homework in the kitchen or the living room, and she'll leave all her books and papers in that location. I've asked her to please pick up after herself, to not just leave her things everywhere, but then she'll claim that she's not done with what she's doing, and she's going to come back to it later.

I wanted to wipe down the tables, so I gathered her stuff, put them in her room, and went back to cleaning. When she got back home, she started freaking out about her stuff being gone. I told her that her stuff was in her room, and then she started freaking out about how everything was moved from position, and she claimed she had everything set out the way she wanted, and that it was going to take her forever to get everything back the way it was.

They always had age appropriate chores and as they got older, they learned to become self sufficient by doing their own laundry and put it away, cleaning their shared bathroom, etc.

This year I got married and gained a step daughter who is 14. Now by this age, my girls were doing their own laundry and cleaning their bathroom but I understand that not every kid is. However, I have noticed that my step daughter does very little around the house. Doesn’t clean her room (which fine, her domain), doesn’t do the dishes, expects me or her dad to do her laundry. My husband was also a widower, so it was also just them and I guess he did it all over the years. He admitted he didn’t want her to worry about anything. However, to me, that’s just not how a house is run. We all do our part. We’ve talked in the past about setting up a chore chart so the chores are split between our girls and it’s always “later”.

I said I wasn’t doing laundry until tomorrow but if she wanted, I could show her how to do it. She seemed up for it, so I showed her, she did all the work and I just gave instructions. I told her from now on, she’d have to do it and she said okay. Then I taught her how to run the dishwasher. Afterwards, the three girls and I sat down and made a chore chart, so everyone would take turns doing dishes, sweeping, cleaning their shared bathroom, taking out the trash, etc.

They spent it all on my sister, they told me that they would help me qualify for loans but it was on me. There reasoning was that women make less money than men and have less advantages in life. And that they wanted us to be equal so they paid for my sister's college education but not mine.

However, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships.

Last year, my step son was diagnosed with a learning disability that is not an insurmountable obstacle, but is bad enough that the specialist recommended a specialized school for him.

Between my husband, my stepson's mom, and me, we didn't make enough to afford the school. My parents offered to pay, and my husband and my stepson's mom agreed because it was best for my stepson. My parents are generous people and just came into a large amount of money from my grandmother's passing, which they have put away entirely to fund their grandchildren' education. They also live on the other side of the country, so we rarely see them, but when we do, they definitely take on a grandparent role with my stepson.

The thing is, my husband and his ex refuse to tell my stepson where the money for his education is coming from--ever. I don't think they need to tell him right now, but I think when he's older, it's unfair not to tell him that the reason he will graduate debt free from college is because of my parents' generosity. My step son's mom is open about the fact that she does not want him to know because she doesn't want her son to value my family's contribution over hers. My husband won't even engage with her over it, but I can tell he agrees with her and is uncomfortable with the difference in resources.

I'm not trying to do this so my stepson will like me more than his mom or anything like that, I just feel terribly for my parents because they aren't being recognized or thanked and never will be.

My husband is refusing to engage with me about this and it's making me feel terrible. I know I'm just a step parent and not a bio parent, but it hurts me to see my family be treated like this.

Here is some back story

I am paranoid about my credit. Everyone in my family has let their credit go down the drain and I made promise to myself that I would never let my credit get destroyed if I could help it. 

I recently got a house and I'm still fairly young (M22) but now I have 5 credit inquiries due to the house process.

My brother and his ex have been together for a good amount of years. When they have been having issues I have always helped them whether it be giving them rides from work, giving them money to help, driving them to and from places, quelling their arguments, etc etc.

My brother and his exgirlfriend had a kid recently. However, they were so bad for each other that every other day they would have supreme arguments. This persisted even after the baby was born. They finally decided to break it off. 

Now into the current situation. My brother and his ex were living together in an apartment. However, they got an eviction notice. They didn't do anything wrong. It's a whole separate issue.

Cue my mother. My mother has gone into full grandmother mode. Caring about nothing but the kids well-being. Nothing wrong with that. My mom asked me to sign for an apartment for my brother and his ex since I have good credit. They cannot apply for an apartment for reasons.

For fear of my credit I said no to the ex but yes to my brother. It took me a lot of convincing to say yes for my brother. My mom, was trying to plead with me on helping her get the ex an apartment for her and the kids but I said no. My mom tells me she understand and backs off. I sign for my brother's apartment and they check my credit. And everything is okay right? No. 

My mom proceeds to tell me that the apartment wants my brother to pay the full months Rent on the first and not the deal that they were promised. She then tells me that they pulled out the deposit and wanted to apply to another place. I was skeptical, red flags were already going off but I suppressed them in thinking my mom wouldn't lie to me.

I found out from my brother that my mother lied to me. I'm furious with my mother that she lied to me about this particular issue. I said no and she still went and lied to me in my face. 

My mother is telling me that since I am ""ok right now in life that I should stop being selfish and show some love."" 

TL;DR I said no to my mom about getting my brother's ex an apartment. I did say yes to helping my brother get an apartment. My mother lied and said the first apartment we applied for so my brother could live in was bad so she wanted me to apply for another. I agreed. My brother unknowingly told me that his ex was getting the second apartment thinking I was cool with it. Furious I confronted my mom. Now my mom is saying that I was making things difficult so she had to lie to me.

I’ve been married for 3.5 years, my wife has a son from a previous marriage. He is 13 years old and has the same appetite that I did when I was 13, which is to say, he eats like a pig in a dirt factory. 

I am a manual laborer and the only one who works in the house after my wife had our baby who’s now just turned 2.

I said sorry kid, you can have all the cheesy potatoes and broccoli in the world and I’ll let you have an extra desert but this steak ain’t going in your belly. 

I ate it, and I’m glad I did because I was absolutely ravenous. My wife was majorly upset with me that night and told me I had disrespected her and her son as well as her decision making.

My parents currently live 5 minutes away from my family. My husband and I, plus our 4 kids, live in a home that my parents own.  The house is too small for us, so we’ve been looking to buy something bigger within our kids’ school district. We love the area for a lot of reasons and aren’t interesting in leaving. 

Today, my mom called saying that she and my Dad want to move. They’re relatively wealthy and live in kind of a “party” neighborhood. The people next door are retired and have been throwing parties every day next door for months. Last weekend, things got REALLY out of hand and my parents are done. All of this is understandable and fine. 

However, my parents are looking at houses 2-5 hours away and this is also fine... but they want us to move wherever they go. This is typical for them. Several years ago, they were living in City A. I was in City B. They convinced me to move 2 hours to City A by helping me rent a house there. 2 years later, they moved to City B. They wanted me to move back, I couldn’t afford it, so they bought a second house in City B which is where I live now. 

Now, they want me to move again. And frankly, I’m tired of this. I love my parents. But most of my kids aren’t babies anymore. They love their friends/school etc. My husband’s customers are here. I work remotely, but I like it here. There’s no shortage of luxury homes in this area where my parents could live if staying close to my kids is important. 

I told my mom that I understood why she wanted to move. And if she moved further away, it wouldn’t upset me. But I’m not going to consider moving my family too. We’re happy here. She wasn’t angry, but I can tell she’s really hurt by it and she wants me to reconsider. 

On my end, it feels nuts to even think about it. They move a lot. We moved a LOT when I was a child. They’re welcome to do what they want, but I don’t want to keep following them around.

3073,Asshole,"
I’m a young (22M) guy who loves to dance and go clubbing. At these clubs and dance floors, they get really loud and crowded and frequently you have to “lightly” push your way through to get through the crowd. 

When I’m trying to get through women, I generally put my hand on the small of their back and push from there. I do this because I feel like its gives me good leverage to get them out of my way and quickly and as smoothly as possible. I stay well clear of the girl’s ass and never have my hand there longer than I need to. If the girl is wearing a crop top or something where I would be touching her skin, than I try to put my hand higher if there’s fabric cuz I’m not trying to touch some stranger’s bare back. 

I would do this to men too honestly, however I’m bi and live in a conservative area and am extra paranoid about provoking a guy into a fight cuz he thought I was hitting on him. So I usually push them with my forearm and a much more aggressive to get through. 

Recently I was talking about this and a good friend of mine, told me that this was shitty of me and that girl’s don’t like being touched there at all. I have seen myself as benign cuz I’m just putting hand there to move them, and I’m not trying to “cop a feel”, I’m just trying  get to dance. But I want to know what y’all think cuz I would hate to make people uncomfortable, I’ve been sexually harassed myself and it was not a good time and would hate to be doing that to other people inadvertently. 

AITA?

Edit: I’m the asshole. Thank you everyone for the tough love. I’m going to adjust by just lightly pushing people in the upper back with my forearm, because in these dance floor’s you need to kinda push to move, and I don’t want to spill people’s drinks which can happen easily with touching a shoulder.",194,401,0.87,AITA for putting my hands on the small of girl’s backs?,dcd5b4,2019-10-02 17:08:02,YTA,1799,AITA,"A 22-year-old man who enjoys clubbing and dancing shared his method of navigating crowded dance floors by placing his hand on the small of women's backs to push past them, believing it to be a benign way to gain leverage.

They do not get along, but my dad does not like conflict and it is almost almost always my mom who picks fights. My dad avoids her for this reason, making sure never to be on he same floor as her at the same time. 

I(18) have three younger siblings, two of which are sisters who cannot remember my parents being together(ages 10 and 13). Whenever anything goes wrong, my mom blames my dad, regardless of whether or not the issue has anything to do with him. She’s late to pick someone up? It’s because my dad is a lazy asshole who doesnt do any work. Things like that. She constantly berates him and portrays him as a horrible human being to my sisters, who are easily impressionable and have picked up my moms habit of blaming everything that goes wrong and every personality fault they have on my dad. I can tell it nearly kills him to know that they have been conditioned by my mom to believe that he doesn’t love them. He doesn’t argue with her criticisms of him though(unless it is ever suggested he cares less about us than she does) and typically just takes the abuse.

A few weeks ago my 13 year old sister made an offhanded comment about my dad going on dates with other women while they were together  “breaking mom’s heart” while the 10 year old was also in the room. While my dad believes that my parents marriage should not be discussed with my younger sisters, my mom had heavily insinuated over the years that he cheated on her. My dad, not wanting to further involve them, stayed out of it. But I was pretty pissed about the way my dad is treated and so I took the opportunity to inform them that it was my mom who cheated on my dad and that while it is true he went on dates with other women, this came after my mom informed him she wanted a divorce.

""Let's fuck but don't tell my girlfriend about it.""

I honestly can't tolerate cheating, so I devised a plan. I pretended to be interested and tried to pry out some information about him that might reveal his identity. After a few mins of 'sexy' talk, I managed to get his phone number.

I quickly saved that prick's number and checked if it is registered to any of my social apps (Telegram, Viber, Snapchat). Sure enough, it was. I then messaged his girlfriend our Omegle convo and told him about his secret escapades on this site, It felt good though.

She replied in an hour or so, but her reaction was quite the opposite of what I expected. She's blaming me for seducing her bf (even though it is clear in the screen grab I sent that HE started it) and even threatened to publicly shame me on FB. I keep on explaining to her that I only want to warn her of his prick bf, but she won't listen.

That's not all, even her friends AND her stupid bf joined the fight. They've been messaging and cyberbullying me nonstop since the incident. My friends too reacted harshly and told me it's wrong for me to destroy somebody else's relationship.

There is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree. 

I go to close the door thinking he would be on his merry way and but he goes ""is that a dog?""

Which is fine but then goes on to ask if the dog is protective, does he like strangers etc.

The next day the same thing again so I went to my boss. He sent out an email reminding people to only eat their food.

I live in a nearby city and not always go back to my hometown (where she lives), but when I do we still hangout and really enjoy our time together. 
We were talking about getting back together and she told me she was working on it and that she would be able to be with me again soon, and it made me very happy. 
Last week I went back to my hometown to go to my friend's bday party, my plans were to smoke, drink, and have a good time with my sister and my friends. When I told her that I was going to a party she started asking me to take her with me. I tried to tell her that she would not appreciate the occasion, and that I'd like to have some time to myself, and that we could grab a beer on the next day and spend the whole day together. 
Of course she refused to accept. She said I was basically telling her that she's not good enough to hang out with me and my friends. I gave up on trying to explain to her that I just wanted to have some time to myself. 
A couple hours before the party I noticed that a few names were added to the invite list. Of course her name was there. I asked if she would really go to the party and she said that she was going with her friends (even though she only knew me and one other person in the entire party). 
When I got there and she saw me she started trying to kiss me but I didn't let her (multiple times). A few minutes after that she came to me holding hand with a guy and asked me if it was ok if she kissed him. 
I told her ""I am not your dad. You should do whatever you think is right"".

After about 5 months of dating, my dad's gf and her two kids (10 and 13 years old) moved into my family home. This wasn't too much of an issue as my sister (19F) and I (21F), at the time, were attending universities out of town and did not live at home. I recently graduated from university and moved back to my home town. I primarily reside with my mom (as there is not much space for me at my dad's house), and once a week I have dinner with my dad, his gf and her kids.

Now for the reason I'm making this post: About 3 months ago, I was at my dad's house for my weekly dinner. While at the dinner table, I was shocked to hear the eldest kid of my dad's gf refer to my dad as ""dad"". Prior to this, the kids had always referred to my dad by his first name and had never called him ""dad"". I found this to be really weird and was quite shocked for them to say this so casually. I was especially shocked because the two kids still have a relationship with their OWN dad. They spend most holidays with him and a couple of weeks in the summer with him.

I told my sister, my mom and some of my friends what had happened and they all agreed that it was strange for them to be calling my dad ""dad"" when they have a decent relationship with their own father and have only known my dad for approximately a year. When I confronted my dad about how I found them referring to him as ""dad"" to be weird, he was taken back and confused as to why it bothered me.

AITA for not wanting them to call my dad ""dad"", or am I being immature about the situation?

**EDIT**: *People have been asking for info regarding my relationship with my dad before dating his GF and currently* \- My parents separated roughly around 10 years ago and didn't finalize the divorce until 6 years ago (hence a pretty rough divorce process). My dad's relationship with my sister and I is okay, not the best. He wasn't a parent I could always rely on, which is why I have a much stronger relationship with my mom. Since dating his current GF and since they have moved in, I've distanced myself more from my dad as there isn't room for me at his house, and I feel like a guest at his place. I'm also not close at all with his GF as we have very different views on specific things (ex. I'm pro allopathy, shes pro homeopathy/naturopathy, etc.)

I just want to make clear, however, that I have not brought this up to my dad's GF or her kids, nor do I ever have any intention of doing so. This is just something I've spoken about with my dad.

7542,Asshole,"One of my SO's friends is quite lost with what she wants to do in her life. She's a pretty heavy drug user (currently goes through a bowl of marijuana on the daily, has done shrooms, LSD, and Molly before). My SO has a history of pretty significant panic attacks and there have been several times where I've been unable to help her out (being at work, out of town, basically just not able to get to her immediately) and this friend has been there for her. 

My SO says that her friend is caring and a ""pure person"" but in my eyes, this friend isn't someone I feel comfortable with associating myself with, even by proxy of my SO. My SO and I are on pretty good career trajectories, with one of us on the path to lock in becoming a pediatric surgeon and the other moving into a career in high finance. 

My SO says I'm being pretentious by not wanting to associate with someone who does strong drugs, typically hangs out in scenarios where the types of people who do drugs and typically partake in acts that are similar to people that move in those circles are. She also says that I'm throwing a fit by asking her to slowly distance herself from this friend as I'm not comfortable with the influence she's having over my SO. 

I understand that I may be being pretentious, and if I ATA, then I'll work on opening my world view even more, but I personally feel like even though someone has been there to care for you a handful of times, this doesn't mean that they should automatically be one of your closest friends and be given a pass on the types of things that someone does in their free time.

15461,Not the A-hole,"We’ve been married for 3 years and together for 2 before that. We live in Chicago and there’s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I’ll give it to one of them. Or I’ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She’ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. 

Anyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I’ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. 

A few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. 

Last night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. 

While we were eating she brought it up again. She said “you said you give about $125 a month right babe?” I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says “I outran you this week!” I didn’t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. 

Long story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.

I instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. 

She’s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. 

Now I’m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn’t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. 

EDIT: She gave $200 in one night. Remember this is the end of the month. She’s been giving away money the whole month already. 

Edit 2: Again, $200 plus everything she’s given over the course of March. Also we have a joint account.

Her sister is younger than both her and I, being in her twenties. My in laws invited us to dinner on Sunday and my mother in law had prepared us a wonderful spread which we took part in finishing up preparing. 

My sister in law decided to make the salad, which she had mixed with her hands and fingers together. Usually I have absolutely no problem with hand prepared food as long as hands are washed. My MIL’s kitchen set up is one geared towards entertaining too so we were all helping out at our respective work stations when I noticed her long fake nails and the amount of dark brown crud beneath them.

She saw me looking and snapped that it was just fake tan, and I kinda laughed it off with her and carried on chopping my carrots to make it less awkward that she’d caught me looking.

14229,Not the A-hole,"Last night, I (20M) ended an almost two year long relationship with my girlfriend (19F), let’s say Kelsey, after she gave me an ultimatum that I need to attend church every Sunday or she would break up with me. 

Background: Kelsey knows my history with being forced to go to a Southern Baptist Church from the time I was born until I left for college, which is ironically about the same time we’ve started dating. Being forced to go to church services with messages I did not agree with pushed me away from religion instead of helping me develop a healthy relationship with God. 

Last year, during my first year of college, I only went to church a couple times throughout the year, mostly when Kelsey asked me too. Going to a Methodist church and hearing a different message of the gospel being preached was refreshing and I didn’t mind going whenever she asked. I had begun to grow a healthy relationship with the church and God again. 

During the first semester of this school year (Fall 2018), we went to church a few times again but nothing too seriously. She is a freshman and college and it took some time for her to adjust and figure out what she wants and needs. After winter break, she decided she wants to go to church more often and I support her 100%, as I believe in helping her grow as she needs to, and I’d even been attended church more too as I have been feeling much better about it again. 

The problem happened two weeks ago when Kelsey hit me with this ultimatum: either I start attended church every Sunday, or we break up. I took some time to think about it and realized that’s not where I’m at in my faith and if I start feeling forced to go to church again, it will ruin the relationship I have built back up with it. I tried to explain this and she countered that I truly just don’t want to grow and that I need to force myself to do it. I told her I could build up to going every Sunday but I can’t just flip a switch right now, and she said it’s something she needs long-term. I asked Kelsey to please stay with me and continue to support me by helping me build my faith as I have been doing so that this long-term relationship can happen, because I do love her and she truly makes me happy. She said she can’t do that and I have to fully commit myself how to going to church every Sunday because that’s what she needs in a boyfriend.  I told her I just can’t do that for her right now as it would feel as if I’m controlled and forced to go, despite my feelings on it. She wouldn’t budge even after I tried so hard to find ways to make it work. 

Eventually, I realized I was just beating a dead horse, and said that if there’s nothing we can agree on other than her way, I can’t do that right now. I feel that faith is a very personal journey and at 20 years old, that journey needs to be decided my right now.

15049,Not the A-hole,"Background, I'm 25, my sister is 30 and her partner is also 30. Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. 

It's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. 

So, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..

He was a regular at our house and our son to his as well

My son would usually mention his friend and sometimes his girlfriend (whenever he wasnt around ) regularly during normal chit chat.


So today the curiousity got the better of me so I just went and asked ""what happened with your friend lately.""

Then he hesitates then admit that while his friend and her were in a relationship she was secretly having sex with my son THROUGHOUT THEIR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP FOR A YEAR !


I didnt want to believe that he could do something so cold like that until I got more upset and kept asking if it was true. He finally admitted it and it and showed me a conversation that he had with his friend on the day his friend found out about it admitting it to him.

Now the thing is is that his friend didnt find out about the cheating until AFTER they had broken up for unrelated reasons. My son said that it was his friends NEW girlfriend's friends were the ones to tell him. My son never did. Which made me mad. 


Now normally my son and I are like two peas but that really bothered me and kind of hurt me a little TBH when he told me that. Im not sure what was going through my head but I got angry af cussed him out called him a ""selfish POS backstabbing low life"" etc etc 


""I hope your friend clobbers the hell outta you you cunt shit""!!!!!. 


 In a fit of rage I told him to ""move the fuck out"" in 30 days saying ""I lost a lot of respect for you"" and he was like a brother to you !!  and ""You deserve to be in your own"".

21242,Asshole,"  

I turned 18 a few days ago and on my birthday my dad gave me a check for a little over $5,000 on top of the $100 I normally get for my birthday. I was floored, but then I found out this was just all the birthday money given to me by friends and relatives from the time I was born until I was 14. At 14 I started mowing yards in order to save up for a car and I got my own bank account and got to keep all my birthday/Christmas money. Before 14 when I was little he always told me he would keep the money safe and I would get it when I was an adult. Well I found out he had been investing all the money given to me and $5,000 was just the principal amount. He kept all the interest which was almost $7,000! I don’t think this is fair as he has made money using was belonged to me! I told him I want the interest money as well. 

Because I know people will ask, my parents are paying for my college, but he isn’t using the money for my college. I’m not sure what he plans to do with it. We’re upper middle class so they don’t need the money to pay their bills or anything. 

His reasoning for keeping it is that I would have probably spent the money long before it could get any interest and I would have wasted it buying a nicer car or expensive stuff that I didn’t really need. He also argued that banks also invest your money and keep the interest and he was just acting as my bank.

18398,Asshole,"I still haven't calmed down since learning about this so excuse the anger in this post I'm just really pissed off. My 32 gf kelsie 23 of 1 year lives one town over.

Before we used to spend alot of time together, she used to spend a couple of days at mine and I would stay over hers a few days a week as she has the bigger apartment due getting lucky with a job offer straight from school, possibly a cause of who you know rather than what you know....

Earlier today we were video chatting like we do every day at the moment, kelsie has been calling less since she is still working from home from her laptop.

Today I noticed she looked tired and asked if she's getting enough sleep, she said yes but only because of ( random youtuber) I asked to check our the channel so she linked me.

It's just a random YouTube guy that films nature audio and scenery, like rain falling or one if a snowy mountain wind sounds.

I noticed in his description that he asks for donations to his channel wich I thought was hilariously bad, like he's filming mountain streams on his hikes and expects money for that!?

Kelsie argued that she uses his videos to sleep every night as he has 24 7 live rain videos and a bunch of 12 hour audio stuff.

Then she dropped the real bomb, as I'm laughing at the guy for begging for money on the internet she says that she has donated $50 over the last 4 months to this fucking simp.

I asked her if shes speaking to the guy who makes the videos and she said not exactly, she said he emailed her thanking her for the donations the 2 times she donated, wich makes that a blatant lie.

emailing is talking too, she also attached notes to her donations wich I asked to see.

In the notes she thanks him for the videos and sings them praise for curing her chronic insomnia.

Kelsie has prescribed sleeping pills for insomia, she absolutely doesn't need to be spending money on this random guy on YouTube.

Shit hit the absolute fan anyway because kelsie must have called her dad to intervene and he called me and told me to fuck off away from kelsie and called me controlling.

Kelsie also messaged me to say she needs some space wich is hilarious in itself as we haven't seen each other in 5 fucking weeks.

You have to press and hold the button in order to speak with the apartment itself, which is too complicated for most people. We do not have a concierge and someone has to come down and open the door to let you in, we cannot open it from the apartment.

Every day, at least once, my neighbors' guests buzz my apartment or they forget to put an apartment number so the delivery person buzzes me. This is annoying, because the buzzer is loud (and causes my dogs to bark) and nearly every time even if I talk to them through the intercom they don't get the hint and keep buzzing me and not the right apartment.

I got engaged in August to my long time boyfriend and I immediately asked my older sister to be my maid/matron honour. When she got married 3 years ago I was her maid of honour and my sister is my best friend and I love her with all my heart. I asked 5 of my close friends to be bridesmaids. Just one month ago my Fiancé and  booked my dream venue and finalized the date for the last week of May and sent out our save the dates. Before finalizing the date we tried to make sure it was a good date for all our family and close friends. 

One week ago my sister and her husband announced she was pregnant. Obviously we were super happy for her. They had been trying for a while and this will be my first niece and nephew. I then found out she was due  the second week of June, meaning she would be 38 months pregnant at my wedding. 

When I was maid of honour for my sister I planned the bridal shower( including keeping track of all the gifts for thank you notes) planned the bachelorette party, went to almost all the shopping appointments with my sister, and was one of the main go to people at the wedding to make sure everything was going smoothly and made a speech at the wedding. I thought about it and believed this was to omuch stress to put my sister through and there was even a chance she might have to miss the wedding due to giving birth. Im a very meticulous planner and thought it would be a good idea to promote my BFF to my maid of honour and just make my sister an “honorary maid of honour” but put no expectations on her and if she is able to be at the wedding both my BFF and my sister could give speeches.

So I asked my BFF if she was interested in being maid of honor too and she was super excited. I then talked to my sister about this and she unexpectedly got very mad at me and said I was making decisions for her and punishing her for getting pregnant and it was her dream to be my maid of honour and I was being unfair and selfish. She said I was acting stuck up and like a control freak for not wanting a pregnant maid of honor.

Throwaway because I am active in other communities and I don't want this to mix.

So I was supposed to get married 2 moths ago to my ex partner of 5 years. Sadly we broke it off because he cheated on me on his bachelor party with a striper.

I had this beautiful dress that cost me arround 2k dollars (out of my pocket). I had been very depressed since everything happened because I felt it was somehow my fault for not being sexy enough or not giving him what he wanted. So last weekend I decided to ""take my power back"" and I began altering the dress. I have been sewing for 15 plus years so I know what I am doing. I cut it a bit, changed the color to something less wedding-y and after a week of work I had a beautiful gown that I could use for more stuff.

The problem comes now. I uploaded that picture of the dress to Instagram with a caption that said something along the lines of "" you can change the worst memories"" or some shit like that.

My sister hits me up and asks me if that was my old wedding dress and I told her yes. She then called me and asked me why I had done this. I asked her why it was such a big deal. And she told me that I could have waited till after he wedding. I was so confused. Then she reminded me that when we were staying at the hotel where my wedding was supposed to happen my mom and sister where there cheering me up and my sister said something along the lines of ""oh well if you are not using it i will"". We all laughed so I thought it was a joke because it was never brought up again after. She just asked me once what material it was so I assumed she wanted something similar.

So my school made this dumb rule that nobody can have a water or drink bottle with them because a couple seniors got caught drinking vodka at school.

The only exception is if you have a form signed by your doctor saying there's a medical reason you need it. And carry the note with you whenever you have a water bottle so you can show it to teachers or administration.

Now, my doctor who i have my yearly checkup with is also one of my mom's best friends, and last week she and her daughter were coming around to hang out with our family.

I was telling her and my mom about the school rule and they thought it was silly too. My doctor was talking about how unhealthy it was to not let kids drink water all day, and sell them sugary sodas at lunch 

I asked if she'd sign a doctor's note allowing me a water bottle and she said od course. So I printed out the form and she signed it. There was a section saying to describe the medical need and she wrote ""water is necessary for life"" which my  mom thought was funny but also thought might get the note rejected, like it was obviously meant for specific medical conditions or disabilities. 

But she said that if anyone had a problem with it, to have them call her and they'd get a piece of her mind.

So I took the note to school and a bunch of teachers told me I couldn't have a water bottle and I said I had a note. Most of them didn't read it closely enough to see the reson but out of the two that did, one laughed about it and asked if it was real. I said it was, she could call the number on the form. She seemed satisfied.

The other teacher threatened to take the note away, saying medical exemptions were not a joke, it was a disrespectful thing to do, disrespectful to the school's rules and disrespectful to people who had an actual medical need, to treat it as a joke.

She works extremely long hours with hardly any days off whilst I work a typical 9-5 job so I’ve always taken care of arranging the kids for school and care etc.

Well with lockdown, I’ve been able to homeschool my daughter but since my wife is an essential worker, my sons nursery has still been able to take him in so I have dropped him off there as normal as even though I’m homeschooling my other kid, I’m fitting that around me working from home. It makes it easier for my son to still have his routine and so I can do my work and so on.

Anyway, I was going to pick him up like normal but my wife chose to do it as she was off at that time and could actually get him. The people at this nursery know my wife as do the parents even though she’s rarely there. She was actually happy to be able to pick our son up from nursery for once and I thought it went fine until she came home in tears.

She told me this nursery worker who has just started there didn’t believe that my wife was our sons mother as this worker had only ever seen me. The other workers and my son told her that my wife was in fact the mother and that she wasn’t a danger to my son. The new worker still didn’t believe it and said that she didn’t feel comfortable with letting a 3 year old go off with a random woman she’d never seen before. My wife got really upset and it in then upset my son as everybody was practically saying there was no danger as my wife was a mother. A few other parents got dragged into this and backed up the other staff and it was only through relenting that the new worker gave up but she made a really angry comment along the lines of, “maybe if you were here more often, I wouldn’t have to verify your identity.”

My wife wants to forget it happened but I am very angry so the next day I picked up my son and asked to speak the woman in charge about the new worker.

14129,Not the A-hole,"First, background info.

My parking spot is challenging on its own. My parking lot is in the back of my building and each spot is long enough for two cars. The first few spots of the lot are on a decline towards the building (meaning the part of the car closer to the alley is higher than the part of the car closest to the building). To make things worse my spot is the very first one and is next to the sidewalk, which is level to the alleyway. My spot has a giant manhole at the end right by the alley and sidewalk. This manhole is so messed up if you aren’t careful going over it you bottom out. Finally, and important to note, there is an entire parking lot on the other side of the alley that is empty and does not tow.

Next door to my building is another apartment building; however, this one does not have any parking spots allocated to it. In the past couple weeks there has been this same car that parks off the side of the alleyway blocking my spot. Earlier this week as I was leaving for work and she was blocking my spot. She didn’t move until I shot her a look.

So today, I was on my way back from work. Full disclosure, I was in a bad mood because school, work and life exist. And, I had accidentally slammed my entire hand in the car door while leaving work about 15 minutes prior. I get to the lot and SHE WAS BLOCKING MY SPOT AGAIN. I had to come in from the other side and finesse my way into the spot like I’ve never had to before. Took me an extra 5 minutes, and I only had one good hand at the moment.

So, then I see her come out of the building next to mine (as the door is literally RIGHT NEXT to my car). So, I get out of the car and I just look at her and I say, ""Not to be a dick, but do you think you could stop parking your car there. We both know this isn't the first time you've been in my way and that's NOT a parking spot. There is quite literally an entire EMPTY lot right beside where you are parked and you chose to BLOCK me so that you were, what? 5 feet closer to the door? Do you think you could maybe not? I'd hate to be forced to have your car towed"". (And yes, that is almost exactly what I said and I have an attitude when I'm in a good mood so I'm sure it came out assertive and sassy) She looked shocked/scared and let out a meek, ""okay"". I rolled my eyes and just walked away.

There's consistently been a clear favouritism towards his son ever since he was born, something his second wife only noticed when they had their daughter. When she picked up on it, they split up. Before the split, my daughters described their weekends with dad as him focusing on their brother while they were babysat by their (now ex) stepmother.

We have almost identical custody agreements, with him getting every other weekend, but the weekends don't overlap at all, meaning the 2 sets of kids are never there at the same time. He's asked her to switch her weekends, but she's refused, so now he wants me to change mine so he has all 5 kids on the same weekends.

He presented it as a bonding thing, and they should be around their half siblings as much as possible in order to get the full sibling experience. However, he also mentioned that his mother could only come by 2 weekends a month (she lives a couple hours away and the kids love her but making the drive is always a hassle so they don't see her much). The mention of his mother makes me think that he might be planning on having her take care of the girls while he spends time with his son.

Because of this, I've refused to switch weekends. My ex says I'm being unreasonable, this works best for him, and he's the one dealing with 5 kids, he just wants to make sure all his kids have a relationship. I asked my boyfriend about it, as he has half siblings, and he sided with my ex, saying that he wishes his parents had done more to facilitate the relationship between them all early on. My hesitation is still that it sounds like he's planning on having his mother watch the girls while he spends time with his son, and I don't want my kids (or their half sister) pushed aside and if we kept the weekends how they are then he has to spend time with them in some form. I have brought this up with my ex husband before now, but he insists he loves all his kids equally and that I can't make statements about how much time he spends with each kid as I'm not actually there.

I think I might be TA because it's about the kids and it's better for the kids to have a good relationship with their half siblings, and the best way to facilitate that is for the kids to all be in the same place at the same time.

My mom is 46 years old and seven years ago she got divorced from my dad and came out as lesbian. She had already begun a relationship with a female friend that lasted for another four years. She was even supposed to adopt that woman's daughter and become her parent, but she unexpectedly left my mom.

Throughout this whole mess, my mom and I maintained a good, healthy relationship and I even loved the woman she dated and her daughter who was a really good kid. I was 14 when they got a divorce and I understood why it had to happen, I wasn't angry. Even my dad got more positive when it was just me, him and my brother, he remained in good relations with my mom.

After a horrible break up, my mom had a really rough time. I could tell it really took a toll on her. She wanted to be alone, so I couldn't be there for her all the time.

Some time later, she told me she met a girl at work. They started dating and my mom drastically changed. She became positive again, she was much happier. I noticed though that she avoided introducing me or my brother or anyone to this girl for a few months. One day I decided to drop by her place when I was heading home. When she let me in, the girl that she's dating was also there. It was her coworker's daughter, who is 19, only two years younger than me. I was so shocked and disgusted that I lost it and started yelling at my mom. I called her out before storming out.

So im a sophomore in college, and the first three weeks I was really irresponsible with my money& especially considering I'm off of a meal plan, and I have to cook for myself. Thankfully- I was able to get some money from my parents- $200, and I made a budget. So back when I had little to no money, I asked my roommate, who I'm really good friends with to buy some items amounting to $35 because I had to return some Amazon items and that would be my exact gift card amount. I asked her then- about two weeks ago, if it's okay to give her the gift card, and she agreed. I got paid yesterday, but I have some major expenses- like materials amounting to around 120$ and I had to pay a friend 40$ for a textbook I sold to her that she wound up not needing. With those, and considering I have other small expenses that need to last me till the 27th. I made a tight budget, and then my roommate asked for the $35 dollars in cash- because she had spent too much money and she wanted to spend more without her parents knowing. I really can't afford that right now. Hopefully if the small supplies I need- find out the list of the art supplies I need on tuesday- if I have anything left over I can pay her. But I feel a bit annoyed because I already settled the $35 with her before, but she wants cash now. And I can't even use the card really because Amazon's grocery service is overpriced, and I could get a lot more at my grocery store for $35. I feel bad, so I scrounged around $14 dollars in cash and bought some fresh groceries at a small local market- so I can try to pay her back.

I do feel bad that I'm basically getting paid to sit down and do nothing most of the time.

Three years ago I got braces to correct my crossbite, they were taken off last year and now my chin doesn’t protrude anymore and my smile isn’t crooked. It’s done wonders for the shape of my face.

Two years ago, I went to Seoul, South Korea to get some plastic surgery done. I got 3 procedures: a blepharoplasty for my uneven eyelids, a rhinoplasty to straighten my nose, and a procedure that lowered my hairline. 

I chose a high quality surgeon with a good reputation, and the results are very natural. None of the procedures were too drastic anyways.  Overall, my face is a LOT more symmetrical. I’ve even gotten “scouted” by modeling agencies when shopping, something that NEVER happened before.

Finally, I got a breast augmentation last year which turned my cup size from 34B to 34C. Again, it wasn’t a very drastic change and it looks natural. All of these procedures were paid out of my own pocket with money I earned and saved throughout the years.

I live with 2 guys my age in a 3 BR 2 BA apartment. I was friends with one (P) before we moved out here and the other was a friend of P (T). Before agreeing to live together I talked with P and he said they were pretty clean.

After 2 weeks I realize we have VERY different standards for cleanliness. I not a neat-freak but good lord they were gross. At first cleaned up after them, but once it became routine I spoke up and told them to clean up their own messes. They never did and I was left cleaning.

On Thursday I come home and go to the bathroom, but the toilet was to the brim with murky brown water and big doodoo chunks. We have 2 bathrooms. P uses one and T and I use the other. I come out and theyre watching TV. I asked “Who fucked the toilet?” knowing full well it was T. Neither of them say anything. “T I know it was you, can you go clean it up? Its nasty and I need to go” T says “Are you serious?” I respond “What? Its your mess.” He goes “Are you really shit-shaming me? Everyone is fucking ashamed of when they take a shit. Yeah ok I clogged the toilet. MY. BAD. That doesnt give you any right to go and talk about me shitting to the whole world”

Im lost and answer “Ok… but are you going to clean up the toilet or…?” T says “Dont know how” Even more lost I ask “Dont know how to clean or dont know how to use a plunger?” He yells “Dude not everyone is a fucking mechanical engineer and knows how everything works” I answered “You dont need to be a M.E. to push your shit down a tube” At this point P joins in and says “If you care so much why dont you just clean it up?” I answer “There’s no way Im cleaning up someone elses turds, this is on T”

Come Saturday the toilet is still clogged. Im refusing to cave because Ive been caving and cleaning their messes ever since we moved in. No chance I let them win this round. I decide to teach T a lesson and show him that his messes arent going to just “go away” by literally shaming him with his own shit. While they were out Saturday night I rigged the bathroom. I aimed an IR sensor at the door and mounted a servo to the back of the toilet with a cable snaking into the well and tied to the water feed plunger so that when T opened the bathroom door the servo would pull on the cable, open the plunger and allow water to feed into the bowl which, already completely full, would overflow onto the floor covering his feet in his own soggy, neglected shit.

That night T brought a girl home from the bar. I didnt know this until I heard the scream. She was the first one to go into the bathroom and tripped the trap. T came running out and I could hear him completely panicking. The girl grabbed her stuff and took off. I came out and T was still freaking out and I said “Shoulda just cleaned it up” And then went back into my room.

T cleaned up the mess and it reeks in the apartment but they didnt know I had anything to do with what happened.

8487,Not the A-hole,"This has been bothering me for awhile so I hoped to get some insight from reddit. Obligatory mobile warnings do throwaway.

Some context: I have been diagnosed with c-PTSD for the last 3.5 years, mainly stemming from abuse and neglect from my immediate family. My parents are both doctors (psychiatrist and retired ER doc), both have been aware of my diagnosis and treatment for at least that long.

Last month was my mother’s 65th birthday, the family reserved a table at a really nice restaurant and invited the immediate family as well as our respective SOs. My bf came along but no other SOs had the time to attend. Nonetheless, being with my family in a public setting makes me extremely anxious and I often have to leave to go to a private area in order to practice breathing techniques, etc. I left once about an hour in after a few drinks, was gone for 10 minutes and returned- everything was going fine and the family was reminiscing, it was actually extremely pleasant.

That is until my twin turns to me and says the exact words ‘hey do you remember when we tortured you-?’ In a joking manner. Though I am sure it was a joke, they were referring to when my family would essentially push me to clean up dog shit in an alley beside our house- the smell was so awful it would make me throw up multiple times (which I would have to clean up as well) and so on and so forth. My brain immediately shut down and I retreated to the bathroom with my bf at the table. He texted me asking if I wanted to leave and - due to the fact I was on the verge of a panic attack or something equally awful - I agreed. My father followed my bf out of the restaurant and immediately started berating me in public for not acting more respectfully, when I tried to explain to him I needed to leave he simply told me I was full of shit (he’d been doubtful of my diagnosis from the start) to which I told him to fuck off quite loudly which got the attention of nearby people. I left quickly and he retreated into the restaurant. We have been on thin ice with one another since. I apologized to my mother and she was extremely understanding, which I appreciate immensely.

I later attempted to explain to him via text but he simply demanded an apology, this man is also the psychiatrist.

21338,Not the A-hole,"AITA for thinking my room mate is ridiculous about the electric bill?

Background info: In February, I met with the homeowner, D as had ran an add looking for a room mate. The terms were $550 per month for two rooms and my own bathroom. Wifi and electricity was to be included in the rent. I would have access to rest of house including kitchen and laundry. The home has a heat pump so air conditioning was a huge attraction for me.

Yesterday we got into an argument over the air conditioning. When he got home around 5pm, turned off the ac. He then opened the front back doors which let all the cool air out, and the hot air in. I was in one of my rooms with door shut and realized it was getting too warm. I asked him why he turned it off, and he said to save on electricity. He said he has to because when he rented to me, he didn't realize I would be home ""24/7 and having my tv on all day"". Really? We are in a pandemic and I am high risk, and also, I am on workers' comp benefits which he knew in the beginning. Also, he himself was home ""24/7"" for about 10 weeks and he is only gone three days a week for work anyway. So he is home the majority of the time as well.

I don't know what to do, if anything, about this. I cannot afford to live on my own without a subsidy at this point. Then I get to thinking, he profited off this pandemic because while on unemployment he was making more per week than he would have been working, because of the extra $500. I myself have been getting $132 extra in food stamps and have been sharing food with him, and buying stuff that only he uses because I wanted to ""spread the wealth"" so-to-speak. 

I believe I have the right to be comfortable in the space I rent. If that means watching tv all day, or having my fan on all day, so be it! We have an eviction moritorium right now and the governor's proclamation even states that the landlord cannot raise the rent either. We do not have a written rental agreement, and the proclamation states that it also applies to those without a written rental lease or agreement.

So today she snooped through my phone. I was sleeping and I woke up to her using me phone, no biggie. But when I dozed off and woke up again like 15 minutes later she was still on my phone and I asked her what she was doing.

This weekend my wife asked her to empty the dishwasher, and take the trash out. She said ""Ok"" then just went up to her room. I went up to her room an hour later, and found her laying in bed watching youtube on her phone (Volleyball videos, nothing important, if anything on youtube could be considered important) I took her phone away, and said ""Your mom asked you to do your chores, not watch videos, please do them so i can do mine"" She said ""Whatever"" and just continued laying there.

5576,Asshole,"Backstory:

Getting married on a Thursday, rehearsal is in a different state (my home state) on a Saturday.

The reason for this is that I’ve always wanted a small wedding. I believe it should be about me and my husband and something that makes us happy and we are NOT big part people. We don’t like crowds and I believe large wedding would make it very stressful and that’s not what we want. 

The wedding would be literally just us, his mom, my parents and my 4 brothers and my sister in law. 

The main reason for this is because I have a MASSIVE family. Both of my parents have 8 siblings and they each have an average of 5 kids. Some grown with children (I legitimately have 75 cousins) I see them all at least once a year (two families I see only once every 5 years of so because of distance), but since if I invite the aunts/cousins that I’m close to, id have to invite them all in order to keep peace in the family.

so I decided to do a large reception where everyone is invited to celebrate our marriage but a small ceremony where his mom can come (she is sick and cannot travel so we are getting married close to her home) and both of us are comfortable enough to have fun and actually enjoy our wedding.

However, I was wondering if it would be rude to make a registry even though none of the people at the reception are invited to the wedding?

3461,Not the A-hole,"This was like 12 years ago but these kind of things stick with me forever.  I actually lost my job shortly after this and the belief was that it was tied to this incident. Perhaps I'm looking for peace of mind, perhaps I'm looking to be put in my place here.

I used to stock groceries for a major chain.  We'd come in after closing time and stock overnight.  Everybody would get 1 to 2 aisles.  Some aisles (like baking goods) with heavier items would be given to pairs.  I was bounced around a lot - I'd do frozen because I have a high tolerance for cold (I wore fingerless gloves handling ice cream because..im an idiot - not important). 

One co-worker I'd get paired with was a dude with a hearing disability.  Sometimes he'd get paired with a second person and sometimes he'd get a really easy aisle like greeting cards.  

One night he got placed with me on baking goods, lots of 20kg bags of sugar, flour, etc.  He had a tendency to fuck off and do his own thing. I'd constantly have to ask when I get a new pallet if anybody had seen him.  Sometimes he'd be taking an unannounced break. Sometimes he'd be in another aisle entirely rearranging things that were already stocked.  About 8 hours in I got fed up. He had unpacked about 3 cases of product all night while I was doing a ton of heavy lifting and hadnt taken even my standard lunch break because our boss was a dick and I wanted to make sure the job was done before I could relax.  I lost my shit at my supervisor.

(paraphrased, its been a while)

S: Why's there still 3 pallets to unload?

Me: I have no help.  This is a two man job. Why does (coworker) even work here if he doesn't stock shelves? 

S: You know he's deaf right?

Me: I don't care. Does deaf mean he can't open boxes? Last I checked you don't need to hear to put cocoa powder \*here\* (I slammed a tin on the shelf)  I get paid the same as he does but I'm doing 10x the work. This is bullshit.  I haven't even had a break tonight.

The rest of the night he was moved to a different aisle (i think he was putting binge items at the cashiers tils) and I was ""punished"" by working baking alone.  I barely got everything stocked - but my shifts started to reduce.  I was there for about another two weeks before a (seemingly) unrelated incident where a boss tried to grief me for not doing enough work (solo'ing another two man aisle), proceeded to unload a single pallet by himself to ""prove a point"" - to which I told him ""I'm supposed to be impressed it took you twice as long to do half what I do"" before walking out.

About 6 months ago she started going to the gym seriously and added quite a bit of muscle, especially to her ass and thighs (that was her goal, to get an ''Instagram butt''). She's got that 'thick' look going on. You can tell she works out.

I'm a skinny guy, I've never really lifted weights. I'm 6''2 but only weigh 155lbs. Sometimes I go running though, so I've got a lot of endurance. My GF asked me to come to the gym with her and work out with her, so I agreed.

Well she went to squat so I went to see how she does it. She loaded some weight on and performed a set with the highest weight she's ever done. She struggled but was able to *just* perform it. She was pleased with herself after it so I asked if I can have a go, as I was curious.

Well I performed the squat and was able to do her weight quite easily. So I wait a few minutes to try again, but this time I load on an extra 15kg plate on each side and try it. I struggle but I'm able to perform the set. 

My GF looked shocked that I was able to do that, later on she said that I ''ruined'' her session by being an ''asshole'' by feeling the need to ''one up'' her.

I said ok, I just wanted to see if she needed any help, and she replied “ I dont need your help”, again super angry.

Cool, went back to my table, and saw her struggling to get up. Then one of the baristas came, and asked if she could help, the woman tried to get up again and failed, so she let the barista help her. 

She couldn’t help her alone, as the woman was quite big. So another person went to help, a costumer, but they were still struggling to lift her up.

The barista, which was not present when she refused my help, turned  to me and asked if I could help and I said “ I was trying to, but she told me to back off, so yeah, I’m good”.

13086,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because people know about my Reddit. 

My friend took a trip abroad for nine days and asked if I could look after her dog in the meantime. I have never taken care of this dog before but my friend said he isn't a problem since he is easy to take care of. She said she'd pay me because of all the help. I told her I would do it, I love dogs and since he is easy there will be no problem. And I do not mind getting some extra cash to spare either. 

Except, this is not true. 

The dog can't last a minute by himself, he starts crying if I leave, even to the bathroom. I live in the fourth floor of an apartment building and I can't go to the store or gym because I hear him howling and crying, all the way to the front door downstairs.

 I had to take him to work with me yesterday because he just couldn't stop crying when I was leaving. 
He starts whining and howling if he can't come and sit on the coach with me, he does that when I go to sleep if he can't sleep in the bed with me.
 Every single sound he hears from outside of my apartment (people walking outside, the elevator) he starts barking loud and doesn't stop even if I tell him to. 

I know it takes a while for the dogs to calm and settle down when they are in a new environment, especially when the owner is nowhere to be found but it has been nearly four days now.  I've had two dogs before so I do have some experience with them, and I've tried everything but none of it seems to be working.  

I  try to keep him busy with bones or chewy toys but right when he is noticing I am about to leave he starts jumping and crying. I try to put on some music or leave the TV on, same thing happens. 
And I know I should leave and just let him bark and wear himself out but I also don't want to risk anything and get any noise complaints since the landlord in my apartment is super strict. 

I confronted my friend and told her that I am not sure if I can look after the dog full time since he is not easy at all like she first said. I have work and other things to do besides this.

 I told her kindly that I am happy to come up with a solution and work something out with her, and she doesn't even have to pay me the money she promised. Her mom lives quite close but she has a condition which means she cannot walk the dog, but I told my friend I would be happy to take him out for walks if he could stay at my friend's mom's place. 

Now though, my friend is mad at me because ""I am insulting the way she has taught her dog"", I can't keep my promise and because I am ruining her vacation. She told me to use the spare key to her house and bring the dog back there and her neighbour would feed the dog and take him to walks every morning and evening but that would mean the dog should spend his nights alone. I tried to come up with more solutions but she is telling me that I ruined her vacation and the dog is not my problem anymore.

AITA?

UPDATE: My friend called me and told me to take the dog to her house. She told me her neighbor will look after him. This means he has to be alone during the nights.

3353,No A-holes here,"Sorry, this is my first post on Reddit because I'm kind of concerned about my roommate. She's a freshman and at the beginning of the year, I thought she was really quiet and she was in the room a lot (she plays video games and watches Netflix, primarily), but I thought she was otherwise fairly typical. However, I recently found out that she switched all her classes to online versions of the class and that she's been eating frozen meals instead of going to the dining halls. I was recently sick for a couple of days (so just went to classes that had tests for an hour/1.5 hour) and then went straight back to my dorm. I don't think she left the dorm the entire time. I've tried inviting her out for food or just to hand out with friends, bust as far as I can tell, my question is not an exaggeration at all.

 I'm concerned because it can't be good for her physically or mentally to stay in our tiny room all the time. I'm hoping my RA would be able to tell me that she is already aware of this or she'd be able to refer my roommate to some help. At the same time, I feel like I might be tattling on her and as someone who is also pretty introverted, I can kind of understand why she doesn't want to leave.

I tell him this and ask what happened to the birds.

 He said his Mum feed them for a few months after his sister left but got sick of looking after them and set them free. Which horrified me even further because where we live, the birds would have likely died of exposure. I told him this, saying that if they didn't have the time/resources to  look after the birds they should've given them to the SPCA or other similar organizations. Saying that because of the actions of him and his family, the animals suffered. He got very defensive and angry, saying that its not his fault because they weren't his birds, and not his responsibility. As well as that because his Mum is a single parent working full time, she was too busy to take them to the SPCA.

So, this happened a couple of days ago. I asked a couple of friends about this, and one of them suggested I should write and ask about it here. I’m not a native speaker, so excuse my mistakes.

I (26F) have a 2 year old son. I was having a conversation with a friend and mentioned that my son doesn’t really like to shower, but loves baths, so when I do prepare a bath for him we usually bathe together. I bring all kinds of toys and cups, because he loves to spill water on himself and even more when he splashes it at my face. If you ask me it’s a win-win situation. I can wash my hair and his at the same time, and he loves the play time with me in there.

The response I got was not what I expected. She looked actually disgusted. She said what I was doing is very inapropriate especially because he is a boy and that I’m emotionally and possibly sexually abusing my son. I disagreed and we had a huge fight. When I told my other friend what happened she said she sees her point and maybe I shouldn’t do this anymore.

I am so confused and I’m wondering if AITA for bathing with my son? Am I abusing him?

17002,Everyone Sucks,"First, sorry for the wall of text there’s a TL;DR  at the end 

(FYI: I personally DON’T like porn for ME, I can’t get off from it. BUT *PLEASE* I don’t mind my SO watching it, *DONT ASSUME THAT*. My dislike for porn ISNT why I’m mad.) 

So me and my SO just got into an argument where I absolutely lost my shit. 
For starters, we have had multiple fights in the past about his lack of communication / lying habits.

This fight in particular started because my SO was watching porn and masturbating, in the bed with me while I slept... I initially thought he was looking at my nudes and got turned on and we ended up having sex. Afterwards, he asks to shower. I showered last night so declined and just went back in bed after cleaning up. I was curious as to what nudes in particular he was looking at, so I opened his phone and found the porn. I was a bit sad, ngl I felt like I wasn’t good enough because I was RIGHT there and he has so many of my nudes... I was just shocked. 
When he gets back into bed I simply ask him what he was looking at.

(a little while back, I bought a dildo and wanted to start using it - his response was “what’s the difference between that dildo and another dudes dick” / “you have me, you don’t need the dildo” so I was curious to see what the fuck his excuse was for watching porn if I’m “right here” ) 

He ignores the question and just says “reddit”, then I ask “why were you touching yourself then?” And he lies to my face and says “no, I was just touching my balls I wasn’t masturbating”  (I KNOW he was masturbating, I’ve been with this dude for 3ish years..) 

After a while I keep asking and he finally admits to watching porn. I ask, “why didn’t you tell me in the first place? Why’d you lie?”and his response is “I was embarrassed.” I get it, I do, but he still lied...

I then ask him what the difference between me using a dildo and him watching porn and fantasying TO the porn: “the dildo is a physical object, porn is not.” 

I’m honestly pretty pissed he’s able to go ahead and say “no I don’t like the dildo, it’s basically cheating” and further discourage me from using it, to him just watching porn and masturbating? He also said that it was a “substitute” for having sex with me?! But, I can’t have one?! 

I brought that up and he said “Nono I never said you COULDN’T use it, I said I didn’t like it” (oh yeah, so telling me it’s basically cheating is really going to make me feel great about using the dildo).

I generally wouldn’t care if he watched porn IF he wouldn’t put me down for using a dildo?? Is it just me, or is he a hypocrite?

Sorry for the long post, wanted to get as much info in here, but finally I just want to ask: Am I The Asshole here?

TD;LR : my SO hated the idea of me using a dildo, told me it was “basically cheating” because he’s “right here”,  then goes on to watch porn in our bed right next to me and expects me to be a-okay with it.

Edit: I don’t mind him watching porn, I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST IT. Yes I know I said that I personally don’t like it, but that doesn’t mean my SO can’t. I never said that. I thought I clearly said that I’m just frustrated he was treating me unfairly, PLEASE. I have NOTHING against OTHER people watching porn.

1869,Not the A-hole,"Considering how this subreddit feels about destination weddings, but hear me out here.

I'm at the beginning of planning my wedding to my boyfriend of 6 years. We don't have many of the details planned out yet, but I know for sure that I want to have it in a city that's about a 4 hour flight away from us. While it was most definitely my idea, my fiance is 100% behind it. I told him I wanted to get married there when we took a trip there for our 4th anniversary. 

Now, my mom isn't exactly elated about it, but she's excited to see me get married. His mom, however, is acting like it's the end of the damn world. We were at dinner with his parents when we brought it up and she just shut down. Didn't say a word about it. Just went back to eating and pretended she'd never heard me. We ended up awkwardly changing the subject to avoid any more of the painful silence. 

Two days later she calls my fiance and starts wailing at him. Apparently she knows that this is my fault and I convinced him to get married far away because I don't want them there because I hate her and I've always hated her. Exactly none of this is true, of course. She and FIL are perfectly capable of traveling that distance. He's getting up there in age but they take yearly vacations to Europe that far exceed that travel time. 

She called fiance yesterday and laid the big one on him. Either we have it here or they don't attend. I'm only half surprised, really. Now fiance is sort of freaking out. He's been shifting between upset and pissed and straight up heartbroken. His mother has always been a piece of work but this is just next level. He tried asking her why but she just kept saying that she doesn't want to be there if he refuses to respect her and his father's wishes. 

His brother texted me today asking if I'd please agree to move the wedding here to keep the peace. I'm far more inclined to call this woman on her bluff because I'm about 90% sure that she's bullshitting in an effort to manipulate my poor fiance.

8294,Asshole," Howdy. Just been caught in this 7 month lie a couple days ago, so wanted to come to the good people of Reddit and see what you guys think! Basically, my wife Janet claimed she hates diet soda because it gives her migraines. Okay, fine, but the problem is that she wanted to lose a good \~10 lbs because she was starting to approach the “overweight” territory. 

I say that was a \*problem\* because she’s an absolute soda addict. She’ll always take a can to work with her while drinking another on the way, AND having at least another for dinner. 

Anyways, since the beginning of the year, I’ve been lowering my sugar intake immensely. I bought myself a huge pack of Pepsi Max, and the wife’s been taking some when she goes to work. My wife is kind of food-label illiterate, so she didn’t even take notice to the “zero sugar” printed on top of the can.

I originally bought it for me, but since she kept taking and enjoying them, I started buying it for her as well. Pretty soon, the only soda she really drank in the house was Pepsi Max. I also bought myself some Diet Fanta and she’d make some snide comments with how I’m “destroying my body with cancer” and I was just ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

Anyways this all came to a head a few days ago when she shrieked from excitement for being 8 pounds down since the beginning of the year. I took it as a great chance to mention that it’s likely because she stopped drinking so many calories everyday. She asked what I was talking about and I went to get the soda can and showed her where it says 0 calories. I explained it’s in essence a diet drink with the same artificial sweeteners as diet fanta and other diet drinks have. She looked horrified and called me “such a fucking asshole” as I sat there laughing my ass off. 

What do you guys think; was what I did harmless, or did I go too far?",140,68,0.82,"AITA for giving my wife Pepsi Max, even though she claims that “diet drinks give her migraines”?

3821,Everyone Sucks,"Not really sure how to caption this but here goes...Monday morning I heard noise outside the house and saw a cat  getting mauled by 3 feral dogs. As much as I felt sorry for the kitty I was not going to challenge 3 dogs to save it, and nobody was home, so all I could do was to throw a few coke cans from the 2nd storey to scare them off. Didn't work.


I only dared to walk out when the dogs were gone and found the cat already dead. I snapped a few pictures and posted it to the neighborhood group chat. Since nobody seemed to know where the cat came from, I couldn't leave all that to rot at my doorstep. I called up some cleaning services and had them dispose the cat, clean up the rest of the mess and disinfect the area.


Yesterday I got a visit from an angry crying lady claiming that the cat was hers, and she accused me of killing her cat. Well not literally, she understood that the dogs did the job, but she was upset that:

1. I did not save it

2. I threw it away like trash

3. ""Showing off"" its carcass to ""gain attention""


All I could do was to apologise, I couldn't really argue with a grieving person. After letting her blowing up all that steam she finally left. I am now wondering if it is really my fault, even though I apologized to her I don't really think I am to be blamed for the cat's death. Who lets their cat out with feral dogs in the neighborhood? And what was I supposed to do with its carcass? Leaving it to rot till the owner shows up? AITA?


FYI: For those concerned about why I post the pictures, people in the group do that all the time when we find dead or injured animals, not the first time somebody's pet got mauled by the dogs already, and they could carry diseases. I did not post it as a showoff, more like a warning "" feral dogs strike here"" and ""Does anyone know if this cat has an owner?"". Nobody at that time responded, so I assumed it was a stray had it cleaned up.",269,427,0.93,AITA owner blames me for causing her cat to die,d6sxh1,2019-09-20 10:28:28,ESH,1917,AITA,"The narrator witnessed a cat being attacked by feral dogs but felt unable to intervene safely.

257,Not the A-hole,"I (35F) share an apartment with a flatmate (29F) in a two bedroom, one bathroom apartment. She moved in several months ago before Xmas after my long-term boyfriend unceremoniously left the country and ghosted me. I couldn't afford rent on my own, so I found someone to move it. She's a doctor, and I work for a tech startup. 

*For information purposes that may be valuable: she has a separate lease with my landlords, so she's not my sub-letter; the country we live in doesn't have strict restrictions currently wrt outside movement; we are both foreigners from different countries in the country we live in; she spends multiple days a week riding her horse, so in theory, she has time to herself. And yes, this is a throw-away. :-)*

I work from home, mostly, or in cafes. There aren't co-working spaces in my city. She knew before she moved in that I worked from home. I do the majority of the cleaning and offer her leftovers of my cooking/baking, since I know she's busy. I just generally try to be a pleasant and giving person, but I also recognize she's incredibly busy and that I'm home more to tackle these tasks. 

I suppose this hasn't been a huge issue before, as I used to travel a lot, as well as take classes and go to the gym. But every now and then, she'd ask if I could leave the apartment to ""give her some alone time.""  It never really bothered me much, honestly: we pay equal rent, but she never gets to be in the apartment by herself, so I acquiesced because that seemed fair. I could always find something to do.

However, these requests are becoming more frequent, almost weekly. I tried talking with her, and tried compromising, by saying if she'd like to have personal time in a public area of the apartment, I'd stay out her way completely. Now, though, she's taken locking herself into the kitchen for hours, and leaving me starving. I'll admit, I have a tendency of being over-sensitive, so I'm worried I am over-reacting.

I've decided I don't want to leave the house anymore on request nor do I want her to bogart common areas. I feel like if you want alone time when you share housing with someone, then that's what your private bedroom is for, and shared spaces should be kept open. But I'm worried I'm not being a very good flatmate if I push back on this, or maybe there's an age, personality, or cultural difference I'm not considering. Maybe as an extrovert, I don't truly understand the need for genuine alone time. **So, WIBTA if I told my flatmate to go to her room or go for a walk when she wants alone time, when I get copious amounts of alone time at home?** 

TL;DR: my flatmate keeps asking me to leave the house to give her alone time. She also requests alone time in shared areas of the apartment, meaning I'm stuck in my room to respect her request. I'm really tired of these requests but I wonder if I'm being unfair. WIBTA if I simply told her ""no"" and to take her alone time in her room or even go for a walk?",21,55,0.91,WIBTA if I told my flatmate to go to her room?,g13azj,2020-04-14 10:45:07,NTA,2960,WIBTA,"The narrator, a 35-year-old woman living with a 29-year-old flatmate, is struggling with her flatmate's frequent requests for alone time in shared spaces, which have been increasing to almost weekly occurrences.

15487,Everyone Sucks,"I have this friend and I feel like she tries too hard to be ""LGBT"". My friend and I are both bi. Ever since I met her she's had long hair down to her hips. She's recently got into Kpop and she's cut her hair and dyed it a burgundy color but before cutting it she was like ""I want to look like [Kpop guy] from X Monsta!"" Ever since she's got this haircut, she's been trying to ""act like a guy."" I asked her if she was transgender and she said she wasn't but she would go around yelling through the cafeteria saying ""I'm just a lesbian bouncy boy"". The same thing happens when I'm just having a regular conversation with her, she would ignore what I say and just say ""I'm a lesbian bouncy boy"".

On her Instagram stories, she would post stuff like ""My man is annoying but I still love him"". I asked her who her ""man"" was and she would show me some Kpop guy. 

I also sit next to her during my psych class. We have free time during class sometimes, so once I was scrolling through a clothing site while looking through the swimwear clothes. I was asking her if I should buy a certain bathing suit, which was obviously being modeled and I showed her and she said ""Yea.... is it bad that I'm getting a boner from this?"" She said that very loud and everyone turned around to look at us. I told her to stop and I just sat silently at my desk until class was over.

Whenever we would walk together somewhere she'd say something like ""My nuts hurt"" ""I have a fat dick"" and it's been getting really cringy and annoying.

19657,Asshole," I (33M) have been married to my wife (32F) for the past 5 years. 6 months ago my wife decided to undergo rhinoplasty (nose job) surgery due to not liking the shape of her nose for several years and also to repair a deviated septum (although the primary reason was cosmetic). I personally didn’t think she needed the surgery and the money could have been better spent, but agreed it was her choice to make. 

Here’s where my wife thinks I was the asshole: I was driving her to the surgery and she was getting very nervous thinking about how it could all go wrong. Meanwhile, I was dead tired and it was early in the morning. She caught on that I wasn’t in the best mood and asked how I felt about driving her to the surgery. I responded “To be honest, I’m not looking forward to taking care of you after the surgery”. 

She started melting down, telling me I should have told her earlier if I wasn’t willing to support her recovery. I clarified that I loved her and would take care of her, but I just wasn’t looking forward to it since the surgery was elective and avoidable. This did not placate her and she only got more angry/sad. I apologized profusely after realizing how upset she was, but it was kind of half-hearted because I still thought I was right. 

Fast forward to the present: the surgery went well, I supported my wife as she was recovering, and life is back to normal. However, my wife still thinks I was the asshole for not being more emotionally supportive of her on surgery day. I think I’m probably the asshole but wanted to post to be sure.

8443,Asshole,"In 2012 I purchased about 100 acres as an investment property. Prior to this, the property had been in the same family for about 150 years. I met the previous owner who explained the land had a lot of personal significance but it wasn't financially possible to keep the acres. Since then I've built some cabins that I rent out and have sold off smaller portions of the acreage to lumber companies and other landowners.

&#x200B;

About a week ago the previous owners 21 year old daughter contacted me. Both of her parents had died in a car accident, and while he was alive her father (the previous owner) indicated he wanted his ashes spread on the property that I now own. More specifically, he wanted them spread at a specific spot, which is near one of my rental cabins. I refused since it's bad optics for the renters and I feel uncomfortable with the idea of a dead man's ashes being scattered on my land. The daughter completely went off at me telling me I was a bad person, had no sympathy for her, and called me a bunch of other names.

&#x200B;

I feel like it's my right to not allow her to spread her fathers ashes since it's MY property. I've owned it for 7+ years, it's no longer a part of her family and she's not entitled to anything. She also admitted her father didn't have a will when he died and she's going off things he said when she was a teenager.

&#x200B;

However when I told my wife about this she completely flipped out on me and said I'm TA. I also learned from a friend (it's a small community so word got around about the previous owner and his wife dying) that the daughter doesn't have any other family to help with funeral arrangements, the estate and her younger siblings.

&#x200B;

While I'm sorry for her loss, I don't feel like she has any right to access to my property and after having spoke to me with such disrespect earlier I'm not inclined to be sympathetic towards her.

edit: grammar and clarity

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: A lot of people are asking me if we can compromise on another spot. She was ***insistent*** on a particular spot because it's what her dad allegedly said he wanted. Beyond the renters, I really don't feel comfortable with this mans ashes anywhere on my property

4411,Not the A-hole,"This has happened to me a few times - I’ll order delivery, paying a delivery fee of 2.99-4.99 plus  an appropriate tip and a service charge on top of that. I sometimes get a call from the delivery driver telling me they have arrived, to which I respond that I’m on the 11th floor, doorman will let you in, etc. They then say that I need to come down because they can’t find good parking. When I pause, they usually say something like “ok, well I’m on my way” or something similar.

I feel that when I am paying a premium for delivery service, it’s reasonable for me to expect them to deliver to my door since they are the ones who chose to be delivery drivers in a big city and that parking can sometimes be tricky. I also am often not ready to go outside and would need to change, since I’m not expecting to leave in the first place (like when wearing clothing inappropriate for leaving the apartment).

I recently took her to meet my parents and I've been putting this off for a while. My parents are upper-class and sort of look down on lower-income people and are really big on politeness and ""professionalism"" and all that.

My parents don't even like it if when they call my name I reply ""Yeah?"" or ""What?"". They want a ""Yes?"". I warned her about them and I said I really want them to like you, please just be polite and use a napkin. 

She agreed. We were invited for dinner so I brought her over and we greeted each other and went through all the basic pleasantries. I could tell my girlfriend was nervous. We sat down for dinner and my mom had made a few fancy dishes and I could tell she went out of her way to make everything as extra as possible, probably to intimidate her. This is, unfortunately, something they tend to do. I mostly ate the paella anyway. 

Dinner started and it was fine and everyone was polite. We talked except by about the middle of the meal, my girlfriend abandoned her fork and knife and started eating with her hands.

So my roommate Jake rented this apartment with 2 other people, one of them backed out immediatly before signing anything and the other Jeff didn't want to sign anything as he needed to be able to move out on a quick notice. Jake agreed with Jeff, the condition was that he'd send him his share every month and Jeff would arrange 2 more roomies asap.

Well thats where me and Pete come in, we know Jeff from highschool, we needed a place to stay for college and Jeff asked us to live here on the same conditions as he did. Anyways, everything was split 4 ways usual stuff.

Prior to the whole stuff thats going on right now Jake suddenly had his GF over all the time, but no one brought it up as it aint uncommon to have your GF over for a few days, we all do it. But when she was here a full week, made a load of messes, made our utility bill way higher and literally never left the apartment we talked to Jake who informed us that she was staying for a few weeks because she lost her place and her job. We were all pretty pissed, pointed out he should discuss shit like that before hand and how she could at the bare minimum pick up after herself. He simply replied it was his name on the lease so he could do whatever, however he'd talk to her about cleaning up after herself. Obviously we were pissed but then all hell broke loose in the world and we were stuck with her.

It just kept getting worse, more messes, water bill through the roof, kitchen trashed, other people's food dissapearing etc. Despite multiple attempts to speak to them, demanding she pay her share of the rent and utilities etc, it always ended with ""It's my name on the lease.""

This morning it’s pitch black out and I can tell DH is trying to get some sexy time started again. He keeps moving me around to cuddle closer and tries to kiss my neck and such. He also keeps pulling the blanket off my butt and I’m freezing to death. I’m clearly trying to sleep and roll over to signal, not now, buddy. After almost 40 mins he’s like “okay, gotta go, last cuddle!” Right as my alarm goes off. So I yelled “I just want to sleep damn it!”  Right as he goes in for a last hug. He says “fine!” And gets up. I hit snooze. 

Not two minutes later our son (3years old) starts whining in my face about how daddy left and he wants his TV (he gets 30 mins before school so I can get dressed). I’m furious and call DH and tell him next time he refuses to let me sleep, at least take a minute to take care of the kid. DH said “I know you hate me so much, but I’m not even gone yet, I’ll fix his TV.” 

I don’t hate him. I’m just about to go into a 15 1/2 hour work day with only 4.5 hours of sleep and I don’t see why wanting to sleep til my alarm is a crime. I feel bad I turned him down twice in a row, but can’t a guy take a hint that I want to keep sleeping? 

Edit: he texted and apologized for pestering. I apologized for being a sleepy grump and promised to wake him up when I get home tonight.

19826,Not the A-hole,"Long time lurker, first time posting. 

Background information: 

One year ago, I (21F) cut out my ex best friend (21F) because she was becoming toxic. She would never text/talk to me unless she wanted to rant or needed something from me. She consistently would ghost me every single time we made plans together. What broke the camel back was when she forgot my birthday (she is always preaching about how birthday are important) TWICE. The first time I forgave her because she said she was planning a birthday party for me. On the day of, she completely forgot and I cut her out completely. I have not contact her. 

The Dilemma: 

A couple of months ago (before the paramedic), she showed up at my house, asking if I could help her.  Apparently, she had told her parents she was staying over my place, but was out partying drinking (she was buzzed and I'm pretty sure someone drop her off because she doesn't have her license). I told her no because I don't want anything to do with her and she has to deal with the consequences for lying to them. She began begging and asked if I could tell them that she had stayed her the entire time. I again told her no and if her parents ask I was going to be honest. 

Her parents are sweet, but extremely conservative. They don't believe that their kids should be drinking, smoking, wearing shorts, hanging out with the opposite sex unless they're planning to marry them, and so forth. If they catch them doing any of the thing mentioned above, then they would be punished. (ie: curfew time would be cut, no electronics, no contact with friends). Basically, they're going to make her life a living hell. Her parents believe in the whole ""my house, my rule"". Since she doesn't pay rent (she told me before we became ex-friends), she has to abide to those rules. 

A few hours later, I heard a knock on the door and I opened it to reveal her parents and her. They were asking me questions like why she was outside and such. I merely shrugged, but didn't say anything. I looked at her and she kept giving me a pleading look, but I ignore it. When her parents asked if she had stayed in my house, I said no.  Then they asked whether or not I knew where she was and I said no. I could tell my friend was getting desperate because she kept trying to answer for me, but her parents would tell her to be quiet and let me answer. After I was done answering their questions, I asked them whether or not they knew we weren't friends anymore. They looked at me surprised while she had the look of horror in her face. Her parents quietly said no and thanks for my help. 

I told a mutual friend of ours about the incident and she said while she understands where I'm coming from, I should have lied because I know how strict her parents are. Apparently, she texted our mutual friend about how I ruined her life and it's all my fault. Her parents aren't paying for her ticket to Paris anymore and her parents are expecting her to pay rent.

So she asked me to quit. I just said I'm not going to, for a few reasons:

1) Water polo is really fun 

2) I need to practice swimming in the off-season, and a water polo is a novel, more fun way of doing it than just swimming laps.

3) Her demands are ridiculous and I don't think she should control what I can or can't do because of her jealousy. I don't tell her, for example, not to hang out with her guy friends. So I don't see why should be able to order me around.

She was very vocally against this saying ""we are supposed to be for women, not people like that, they know what they are getting into and deserve everything they get."" One of the other volunteers spoke up about how often sex workers were assaulted, she said that she doesn't care and repeated that they knew what they were getting into, and that it took away from real assault victims like \*\*her\*\*. At this point I spoke up saying that I was feeling attacked as she just blamed me for my assault. She immediately back peddled and claimed that ""this is just my belief about ""those women"" and that she didn't mean \*\*me\*\*.nope, can't say sex worker and not mean me. She then said she has the right to her opinion, but I have to understand that she didn't mean it that way. She apologized for me ""taking her wrong"", it's BS and I'm not happy.During this meeting she also sais that she would never be able to give pro-choice info because its against her beliefs (not a religious belief, she's an atheist), she didn't know it but someone present had an abortion. She was reminded that in the mandate we are a pro-choice center and she can't try and bully people out of their decisions. She said once again that this is just her belief and that she should be allowed to have whatever belief she wants but she will just have to leave her beliefs at the door. As we were all leaving the school, she stops me in the main area and demands I forgive her and give her a hug in font of about 30 students, knowing that if I said no I would look like an asshole.

I complained to the head of the center, but she is a student and doesn't have any control over anything. She brought it up to the school staff member that is in control of hiring and the budget, but so far nothing has been done about it.

My next step is to lodge a formal complaint against her. I been resistant in doing this because 1) I would have to come out as an ex-sex worker to more people and 2) I am a mature student in my 30's whereas she is in her early 20's and it kinda felt like complaining against a child

She has now applied to be head of the center and it looks like she'll get the job because sh'e manipulated the student union into backing her by saying we've discriminated against her by not allowing her beliefs (again not religious).

I am very afraid that she is going to say something to someone who has been through those things when they have come for support. If was younger and still in sex work when she said that to me it would have devastated me and I probably would not feel safe at the school.

10520,Asshole,"  My boyfriend Cam and I have been dating since early this year. It’s been great for the most part, but for the past couple of months we’ve been having arguments about his friend Lauren. 

Lauren and I don’t really get along. She’s like a sister to Cam so I tried to befriend her when we started dating, but she was always aloof to me. She’s very friendly with other people, but whenever I tried to talk to her, she would just answer with a few words then talk to someone else or leave. She would also make me feel out of place whenever we hung out with Cam’s other friends by bringing up things from their college days so everyone would be talking or laughing about something that I don’t know. 

I told Cam how I felt but he said that I must be misreading the situation because Lauren is not that kind of person. He said that I should give it more time, that maybe Lauren doesn’t know me that well yet that’s why she doesn’t talk to me a lot. But I know that she has befriended people who were introduced to her after I was, like Arlo, Cam’s friend from his new job which he started in March. The three of them play online games for hours while she hasn’t spent 3 minutes talking to me. 

More than once I asked Cam to talk to Lauren about why she doesn’t like me, but he refused. He said that unless Lauren was ignoring me or talking shit about me, she technically isn’t doing anything wrong by not being besties with me, and it would just make things awkward between the three of us. One time I told him that would talk to Lauren myself, and he said that I was making a mountain out of a molehill.

Last Friday was Cam’s birthday so I threw a small dinner party at his favorite restaurant for him and invited our friends, excluding Lauren. I figured that I’m the one throwing the party so I should be able to invite who I want to, and I don’t want to invite and pay for someone who has shown time and time again that she doesn’t like my company and is not interested in being friends with me. 

Cam was really happy about the surprise at first, but when he learned that Lauren wasn’t going to be there, he pulled me aside and said I was an asshole for leaving Lauren out. He said I should’ve thought about how Lauren would feel if she learns that I invited everyone except her. I was shocked that he would say that when he knew how Lauren has treated me, so I told him that I just gave Lauren a taste of her own medicine and maybe now she’ll know how I feel when she leaves me out of conversations. 

Cam got really angry and said that he can’t be with someone who would treat Lauren like that. He stormed out of the restaurant and we’ve only talked once after that. I texted him yesterday to apologize and he said we should meet in person today to talk about this. I don’t even know what I should say to him.

This one professor had a decent review on [RateMyProfessor.com](https://RateMyProfessor.com), but one thing a lot of students definitely said was that he’s a hard ass about his cellphone/distractions policy. Now, I don’t care about that. Summer sessions are shorter, so you need to focus more and sped a lot more time in class, learning the material.

The thing is, this professor, if he seems someone on their cellphone or suspects they’re using their laptop for anything other than notes, will stop the lecture to go over and yell at them. This happens multiple times, throughout the class. It gets annoying, disrupts class and basically ruins whatever we’re doing. I get it’s disrespectful and that it’s on these students too, but if he just ignored it (especially as they’re doing it silently-no music or anything, I don’t even know they’re doing it until the professor is yelling-and it’s not bothering us), we could move along.

Today, he did it quite a few times within the first half hour of class. I got so frustrated with him, because we barely got through the first bit of the lecture and I felt like I was back in high school, not a university classroom. I let out an audible grumble and the professor gave me a look. I asked “Can we just go on with class?” He said, “When this student puts their phone away.” I said “You stopping class every time someone takes their phone out, takes away from us learning. It’s more annoying than a cellphone, to be honest.” He started on the syllabus and I just said I didn’t want to argue, I just wanted to learn.

After class, we all got an e-mail about the policies again and if we “had any issues with how he ran his classroom, to please see him after class”.

I don’t know if I made things better or worse. The class is over next week, thank God, I just had to say something because I feel like I learned so little in this class. (Btw, I have never been yelled at by him before this entire session, so I’m not being bitter about it or anything. I’m just being annoyed about having to stop class.) Was I an asshole for speaking up? He’s making it out that I was disrespectful for doing so.",119,291,0.96,AITA for telling my professor he's disrupting the class?,cjfj0f,2019-07-29 18:48:45,ESH,2230,AITA,"A college student enrolled in summer courses finds their professor's strict cellphone policy disruptive to learning, as he repeatedly stops lectures to confront students using their phones, which frustrates the class.

9723,Not the A-hole,"For context, I met a guy on Tinder. Things were going well until we moved over to snap chat. The usual small talk ensues until he spots my pet Cockatiel. He casually says, ""yeah my sister used to have 6 of them, but one of them started eating out its own chest"" immediately alarm bells go off, because for those of you who don't know, birds that aren't taken care of properly pluck their feathers out. I tell him this and ask what happened to the birds.

 He said his Mum feed them for a few months after his sister left but got sick of looking after them and set them free. Which horrified me even further because where we live, the birds would have likely died of exposure. I told him this, saying that if they didn't have the time/resources to  look after the birds they should've given them to the SPCA or other similar organizations. Saying that because of the actions of him and his family, the animals suffered. He got very defensive and angry, saying that its not his fault because they weren't his birds, and not his responsibility. As well as that because his Mum is a single parent working full time, she was too busy to take them to the SPCA.

 I still believe that its horrifying that someone can live in the same house as a suffering animal and not do anything.

 And i still believe that being busy is not an excuse for animal abuse.

Am I just out of touch? Is it possible that his  Mum really didn't have time? I never said that any of his family was a bad person, just ignorant and made bad decisions which cause suffering.

8416,Not the A-hole,"All my (32F) life I have worried about my ability to conceive because when I was 13 I listened in on a phone call between my mother and my aunt where my mom described her fourteen miscarriages to her sister, my aunt, who had so far had 5 miscarriages. I worried it was a family genetics thing. I was taking biology in school and learning about genes. 

My mother is very anxious and overprotective, which I believe is related in part to the fourteen miscarriages.  

I got married. My husband wanted kids, I did not, I relented. I scheduled coffee with my mother to talk about conceiving. I knew it would be hard for her to discuss; she 
I couldn’t get any info out of her
Three coffee dates later she told me her trouble conceiving stemmed from a bacterial issue that was cleared up with experimental antibiotic treatment. 

I told my doctor and she said such bacterial issues are not uncommon, but aren’t usually inherited. 

I got pregnant. I miscarried at 8 weeks on Sunday. I feel like I am dying and to everyone who has miscarried I am so sorry you have gone through this it is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. 

After I miscarried my mother said she had to tell me something. 

She has a genetic issue that greatly increases the risk of miscarriages.  They didn’t find out about it until after my younger brother was tested for something else when he was small.  He has it. They don’t know if I have it. I have the letter from the hospital describing the issue.  urging my parents to get me tested. 

There are treatments now to help people with this genetic issue but they are expensive and I should have been doing them from the start. 

My mother doesn’t understand science. She told me she personally thinks the bacterial treatment can fix the genetic issue. That’s not how it works. 

She told me she was under no obligation to tell me about the issue since she “can’t be sure” if I have it.  She told me I am ungrateful person for being angry that she didn’t tell me sooner.  I fucking asked her what the issue was. She told me I am weak and she had so many more miscarriages and that my “reaction to adversity” is “disappointing.”

She should have told me

She hasn’t told my brother he has this genetic issue

He thinks I’m being an asshole for “lashing out” at my mother, who is “just trying to help me through a tough time.”

I told her if she didn’t tell him by August 1, I would tell him (he needs to know. He and his long term GF deserve to know, treatment works better when you are younger, I’m too old now). 

she Said she didn’t tell me because I am a hypochondriac with a defeatist attitude and I never would have tried to get pregnant if I knew and she knew the doctors would figure it out faster for me than they did for her, and I have such a head start over her I should be grateful.

13742,Not the A-hole,"This happened a few years ago, but I still think about it.

I used to teach 8th grade.  I had one kid, call him Billy.  He was incredibly smart.  But he also just was a pain in the ass to be his teacher.  The kind of kid that people who never even taught him knew his reputation and who he was.   He wasn't a ""bad"" kid, but he definitely was a smart ass who purposely broke the rules whenever he wanted.   It was all for attention, because honestly, if he just came to my room to hang out before or after school, he was actually nice.

We had this ""behavior contract"" students and their parents had to sign at the beginning of the year.  Essentially after a certain number of detentions or suspensions, we started taking away 8th grade activities.   So the first thing was the DC trip, then it was the 8th grade awards luncheon, and finally it was graduation.  I had never had a kid actually get to the point where graduation was off the table, until Billy.  And this wasn't just detentions I gave, it was anyone.  So while I was his homeroom teacher, he had plenty of other teachers he interacted with, and their punishments counted as well.  He knew early on he wasn't going to DC.  And not long after that, he lost the awards luncheon.  However, he knew he was getting close to not being able to walk for graduation.  And he was fairly good for a while.  But it didn't last.  As it turned out, the detention I gave him, was the one to put him over the edge.   Since it never happened before, the principal actually gave me the final call on whether to take away this privilege (I was very upset as I think it should have been his call and he shouldn't have put it on me).  A lot of people I talked to, including my mom, said how graduation is really for the family, and taking that away would suck for them.  In the end though, I said no, he was difficult all year to all of his teacher, so he will suffer the consequences.  And I didn't let him walk.  I'm still not sure whether this was the right call

&#x200B;

12657,Not the A-hole,"Disclaimer: I found out about this sub through watching Cuestar on YouTube and thought it could be a good place to take this issue. I've never used or even really browsed Reddit before, so sorry if I get anything wrong. 

So here's my situation. My mother and I have never really seen eye to eye. We just have wildly different worldviews. Our rocky relationship hit its peak when I was 17 and came out as gay. She kicked me out and we didn't speak for three years. We reconnected about a year ago and, while I didn't move back in, our relationship is a bit more stable than it was previously. 

Throughout my teenage years, I would get pretty sick almost every time I ate and as a result, didn't eat a lot and was pretty underweight. Since leaving my mum's house, I've made several lifestyle changes and concluded that I'm probably lactose intolerant, as the sickness after eating went away after I cut out dairy. Thing is, Mum doesn't believe me. She thinks my boyfriend (who is vegan) is ""brainwashing"" me into thinking dairy is poison and accuses me of having an eating disorder. The comments I can brush off, but the issue comes with food she makes. She *always* manages to sneak dairy products into somehow, as if she's trying to ""catch me out"". The one time she witnessed me being sick after eating something she'd snuck quite a lot of milk into, she accused me of forcing myself to vomit. She did say she would stop doing it, but I know she hasn't because I *still* get sick every time I eat at her house. I've asked if I can just bring my own food and she said no, so I've just stopped eating at her house. 

My stepdad, my grandparents and my aunt have all text me to tell me how offended my mum is and how much of a difficult brat I'm being. I've tried explaining that dairy makes me sick and she keeps sneaking it into my food. I've essentially been told that if I want to have a relationship with my mother, I need to suck it up and stop being so selfish and think of her feelings. Are they right, or should I stick to my gut?

She's super scattered and flakey anyway so we just never made any solid plans. They didn't set a date until mid January. I happened to start a new job in January so I have 0 free time for anything now, especially when she lives an hour away and was my baby sitter (but stopped babysitting to plan her wedding) so now I also don't have a babysitter.

5846,Asshole,"Background:

I live on the third floor of a small apartment building, and I keep a few bird feeders on my balcony. There is also a large tree right next to my balcony, which, recently, squirrels have been using to get to my bird seed.

Last week, the apartment gave me a notice about leaving out food for birds/wildlife. The notice stated that it was attracting ""rodents"" and that bird feeders were against apartment policy. I never saw anything about that when we toured or signed the lease, and other people in the complex keep bird feeders.

I wonder if my downstairs neighbor complained or something; he complained to me one day when I was sweeping that I was getting stuff on his balcony below. Since then, I have made a great effort not to get anything on his balcony when I'm cleaning out there, but the birds might still be dropping seeds or bothering him or something.

I really, really don't want to get rid of my bird feeders. Watching the birds brings me so much joy. I'm basically planning on moving them around to prevent seed from getting on the balcony below and switching to spicy bird seed to discourage the squirrels. 

So, am I a selfish asshole?

Edit: thanks everyone for the feedback!! I think I knew in my heart I was the asshole. The notice asked me to have the feeders down by next week, so I'll use that time to say my goodbyes to the birdies.

6230,No A-holes here,"Just trying to put this throwaway to good use and I really enjoy this sub. It's quite cathartic. This happened last month. So for context, I work at a non-profit. It's been a little under a year since I've been here and it's not been that great. I'm a 24 year old brown dude in an office full of all white girls between the ages of 26-60, except the President, an old white dude who is barely ever in. This context is important because being in that kind of environment, I kind of walk on eggshells and mostly keep quiet. They joke about how quiet I am all the time.  

This could not be any farther from the truth. I don't want to sound like I'm humble bragging but I am a bit of a social butterfly. I'm very much an extrovert and that's just my personality that I don't really display much at work because I simply can't relate to any of them and just out of respect. I come in, put my headphones, knock out my tasks, contribute to anything I'm asked to, and then leave. I'm always a participant, I never exclude myself, I just don't talk much when I'm here because I don't exactly feel comfortable telling this office about my personal life. 

So I'm at a bar and I'm chatting up this girl and we're having a good time and I lean in and we start making out. We do this for about a minute till I stop, look at the girl, then hear ""Heyyyy, [my name]"". I turn around, and it's the other younger co-worker of mine (26F). She just asks in a really sarcastic manner ""how's your night goin?"" I politely say it's going good and make a sarcastic remark about how this is bad and I should leave. We both laughed, and I left. Thought that was it. 

The following Monday we have a staff meeting and the Prez is not there so I'm the only dude. The Chief of Staff asks how everyone's weekend is and we all say good. Then the co-worker I saw at the bar points to me and says she knows I had a good weekend. Everyone turns to me ooh-inh and ahh-ing asking what I did. I smile and just said I went out this weekend to which my co-worker replied, ""he was kissing on a pretty cute girl when I saw him"". They started to laugh, ooh, and ahh even more. I immediately responded to her by saying ""Nice one. Real cool of you."" She was like ""whaaat you're young. It's fine"" I just stayed silent and the COS shut it down pretty quick when she saw my face. The co-worker later had to give me a really uncomfortable apology to which I just stopped her in the middle of it and said no hard feelings just don't say stuff like that.  

When I tell this story to some of my boys, they start calling me an asshole for reacting that way and I shoulda just ""been a man about it"". I don't know what that means. I just don't want my personal life spouted out like that, especially around a bunch of girls. Another friend of mine said that at least now they don't think I'm some quiet kid who sits at home all day. I told him I could care less what they think, I'm there to do my work and leave.

14229,Not the A-hole,"Last night, I (20M) ended an almost two year long relationship with my girlfriend (19F), let’s say Kelsey, after she gave me an ultimatum that I need to attend church every Sunday or she would break up with me. 

Background: Kelsey knows my history with being forced to go to a Southern Baptist Church from the time I was born until I left for college, which is ironically about the same time we’ve started dating. Being forced to go to church services with messages I did not agree with pushed me away from religion instead of helping me develop a healthy relationship with God. 

Last year, during my first year of college, I only went to church a couple times throughout the year, mostly when Kelsey asked me too. Going to a Methodist church and hearing a different message of the gospel being preached was refreshing and I didn’t mind going whenever she asked. I had begun to grow a healthy relationship with the church and God again. 

During the first semester of this school year (Fall 2018), we went to church a few times again but nothing too seriously. She is a freshman and college and it took some time for her to adjust and figure out what she wants and needs. After winter break, she decided she wants to go to church more often and I support her 100%, as I believe in helping her grow as she needs to, and I’d even been attended church more too as I have been feeling much better about it again. 

The problem happened two weeks ago when Kelsey hit me with this ultimatum: either I start attended church every Sunday, or we break up. I took some time to think about it and realized that’s not where I’m at in my faith and if I start feeling forced to go to church again, it will ruin the relationship I have built back up with it. I tried to explain this and she countered that I truly just don’t want to grow and that I need to force myself to do it. I told her I could build up to going every Sunday but I can’t just flip a switch right now, and she said it’s something she needs long-term. I asked Kelsey to please stay with me and continue to support me by helping me build my faith as I have been doing so that this long-term relationship can happen, because I do love her and she truly makes me happy. She said she can’t do that and I have to fully commit myself how to going to church every Sunday because that’s what she needs in a boyfriend.  I told her I just can’t do that for her right now as it would feel as if I’m controlled and forced to go, despite my feelings on it. She wouldn’t budge even after I tried so hard to find ways to make it work. 

Eventually, I realized I was just beating a dead horse, and said that if there’s nothing we can agree on other than her way, I can’t do that right now. I feel that faith is a very personal journey and at 20 years old, that journey needs to be decided my right now.

I’m 27 now, and while at first we were somewhat in contact, after the first 3 years or so the only way I’d hear from or about my parents was through my younger brother, the only one of my 3 siblings willing to speak to me. I am in a loving and committed relationship, I am happy, and until now I thought my parents and family were in my past. Well, lo and behold, my cousin, my fathers sisters son, just came out!! Great for him, I’m proud of him. He is also 18, and his parents were confused but accepted him and now they are doing great and are happy and are an intact family. I guess my parents saw that and realized their mistake, because I got a call from a strange number that turned out to be my mom. That call ended up being nearly an hour of them explaining their mistakes and misunderstanding and blah blah blah. I think it’s bullshit. They don’t love me enough for me to allow them back into my life, and I know this because they shunned me for close to a decade.

15634,Asshole,"Basically, I am a doctor who graduated from one of the top med schools in the country. Because of this, I know what it takes to make it as a doctor. My eldest daughter is also on a medical track: she goes to a top 20 school and is excelling. She is a junior, and will probably get into one of the best med schools next year. 

My youngest daughter is not like us. For my eldest daughter and I, math and science come more naturally. It’s not something we need to work hard at. My youngest daughter, however, really struggles with these topics. In college, she has to study for her STEM classes for hours and hours just to get the average grade at a school that’s not very difficult. 

My daughter, to her credit, is a VERY hard worker and I admire that. However, that hard work could be placed to a field that she can really excel in instead of being a doctor; she will always struggle in med school, but she can take her talents elsewhere and become an amazing law or business major.  

The drama is that she called me yesterday and told me she had trouble getting accepted with an internship, and asked if she could work with me this summer. I basically told her she should reconsider the medical professions because she spends all day studying and she is barely average, and I don’t think she can succeed as a doctor.

Part of that is that she has a very large ovarian cyst that requires surgery to remove. The surgery is scheduled and happening soon. Right now, she looks pregnant, which can't be easy on a teenager. 

Between this illness and life in general, Sarah can be... moody and nobody in life is immune to fits of anger. Today at church, some woman decided that Sarah was in fact pregnant, and that it was her CHANCE at a free baby. Sarah went off on her, calling her a ""barren bitch"", among other things, and causing a major scene that left that woman sobbing. 

My wife thinks that Sarah has anger issues, and that we should punish her for not being sensitive. I don't agree.

First off, why is that woman entitled to say anything if Sarah WAS pregnant? Infertility doesn't make you exempt from social norms. I recognize that my wife and that woman have suffered, but they don't get to just do whatever.

1011,Asshole,"Several weeks ago I matched with a guy on Tinder. He didn't have a photo of his face, but said in his bio that it was because he was a teacher and didn't want to risk matching with his students or their parents. That made total sense - I've seen it happen before. We messaged each other and he sent me his Snapchat username so we could exchange photos on there. We exchanged countless photos and messages over the course of the next week. I was out of town on a business trip, so we made plans to meet up once I returned. We decided to meet at my house, since he claimed to have a roommate and I live alone.

Fast forward to me returning to town. He came over and we had sex. I enjoyed myself and he seemed to as well. We made plans to meet up again. However, the following morning I woke up and he had unmatched with me on Tinder and deleted me on Snapchat. I was surprised and honestly a little offended. Let me start this by saying that usually I'm pretty chill - if he had simply said something like ""I don't think we're compatible and don't want to meet up again"" I would have been fine with it. However, we had made plans to meet again, so I was left wanting an explanation and some closure. I didn't know his last name, but he'd told me just enough about his job that I was able to find him on his school's staff directory. At first I didn't think it was him, because the first names were different. However, I cross-referenced the names on Facebook and found his profile. His profile photo showed him with a woman. I found the woman's profile and discovered that she is actually his wife and is seven months pregnant. I also found their Target baby registry. I was incredibly surprised. In retrospect, his shady behavior - no profile photo on Tinder, only using Snapchat to communicate, immediately deleting all of the evidence after we hooked up - made a lot of sense.

To be honest, I'm not really upset; what we did was purely physical and I'm not emotionally attached to him in any way. I think he's an asshole for stepping out on his wife, but no true harm was done to me, so I don't feel the need to ""get revenge."" However, several of my friends have told me that I have an obligation to inform his wife of her husband's cheating. Based on how well he covered his tracks, I'm sure he has done this before.

For the past 6 months, before we go to bed, I will say ""Did you brush your teeth?"" and she will say ""No"" in a bashful way. I will tell her, ""Go brush your teeth"" and she will respond with ""I'm too tired"". I will then end up making a typical frustrated 'ugh' sound. And it's true she is usually tired.

I had one when I was 11, and after all the pain and vomiting during those multiple procedures, I swore to take care of my teeth. Since then, zero cavities (we're 27 now).  So when she told me she will have to get one, I think she expected me to feel sympathetic, empathetic, and sorry for the trouble she will be going through.

So we got back together. 

Now, months later, it's happening again for the 3rd time and I recognize the pattern. It's not healthy for either of us to keep dragging ourselves emotionally through the mud like this, so I've told her this time I'd like to go no contact. I'll sleep on the couch, make my own meals, lead a single life essentially. I made this decision several days ago and since then she has been crying nonstop. She's asked for hugs the first couple of days and I only shake my head and walk away. Now she just cries harder everytime we're in the same room. It kills me because I want to be there for her, I just know where that path leads.

2734,Not the A-hole,"Edit: the grandparents are from fathers side, my wife is not related to them at all. Her mother an I have a wonderful relationship. 

Edit 2: this question keeps coming up allot so I thought I’d address it. There is no legal arrangement or anything that allows them to have control, Ex was sent out the country and so grandparents helped with everything as much as possible till I came into picture, then she didn’t need as much help. 

My wife (25f) and I (25m) have two amazing children, however  our oldest (5f) is not biologically mine. Currently her father does not live in the country and is not allowed to return, so she primarily just sees her fathers parents (about once or more a week). 

Here’s the issue, my wife had been a single mother for about 2 years before I came along, and immediately my daughters grandparents did not like me. At first when my wife would go to pick up our daughter she was told it was disrespectful to bring me by (even though each time I sat in the car and never got out) from there in continued. When my wife and I got our own place and she needed to move out of her and her Ex’s apartment I of course helped her, most of the stuff was his and so the grandparents came to pick it up, but when they saw I was there did not help me and were visibly upset. After that came the dilemma of birthdays and Christmas, for the last 3 years as this time rolls around the same thing happens, we have two birthday parties because they don’t want to be at the one I throw for her, and then I’m not allowed at theirs, and on Christmas I’m not allowed to come to their house to watch her open gifts, so I go home while my wife and her go and she opens gifts. 

I have talked to my wife about this every year and explained it’s unfair and that I’d love to be there as she opens gifts and is excited, and I hate just being at home waiting. Also now that we have a son (1y) together I don’t want him growing up seeing or being a part of this divide. So I’m thinking of just telling my wife this year, it’s either we all get to be there or she can’t go and they can just drop the gifts off, but I don’t want to seem like an asshole or deprive my daughter of anything.

Okay, let's get into it.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for less than a year and found out a few weeks ago that we're expecting. I'm only 6 weeks along. He has mentioned that he'd like to get married as soon as possible so that I can move in and all the insurance stuff will get worked out for me and our child.

So, I'm in my twenties and he's in his fifties. I'm not asking opinions on this, only adding it in for context. About three years ago, he tragically lost his wife to a car accident. I never dated anyone before him and we met after his wife's passing. We fell in love and are absolutely thrilled about this baby, though it was a major surprise.

I'm at his house every day and his house is filled with photos of him and his late wife. I mean FILLED. Every corner, I see her face. It was very hard to have sex in other parts of the house besides his room because I would look up and see her. I felt wrong in some way. I understand that his home is where he should be able to live peacefully and have what he wants up, but it didn't sit right with me. He talks about her quite often in the most inopportune times, and it bothers me some but I never say anything.

&#x200B;

Anyway, so now that we're talking about getting married and me moving in, the topic of me moving my stuff to his place came up. We talked about redecorating some and I VERY POLITELY asked if we could discuss her pictures. I did not tell him to take them down, but asked if he needed so many of them up now that I will be moving in. He got very mad and said I shouldn't question how he grieves. I was careful not to mention that I wanted pictures of us up, as I knew that may come across as I want to be taking her place. We've only exchanged words when absolutely necessary and that was two days ago. He thinks I'm being disrespectful and ruining what he's done to honor his late wife.

&#x200B;

Allow me to clarify that I do not expect to be taking her place, nor do I want to. I just want our home to feel like my home, too and I can't do that with his late wife looking me in the eyes around every corner. I don't want our baby to grow up and see these pictures and wonder who this woman is all around our house. 

Please, Reddit answer me this, AITA for wanting to create a new life with my new soon to be husband and father of my child?

**Also, I don't mean all the photos. Just a really large amount. I understand that some need to stay, but it's honestly very excessive.**

Edit 1: Due to some details I forgot to include that are being asked. They were married for over 20 years and they both lived in this house together for the entire duration of the marriage. There is one child who does not live at home anymore and he lives in another state. He supports our relationship very much.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: Most of the pictures are just my boyfriend and his late wife. Like just the two of them. I'm not upset about the ones that have her plus all their family or friends. I'm mostly having issues with the dozens of pictures of just them two. When we get married, I would like our wedding photo displayed, but feel weird having two wedding photos out, if that makes sense.

Also staying in our room is my SIL. We were both on our phones. Then, at around 10pm, a couple of dudes I met at the pool earlier knocked on our door and asked if I wanted to play billiards with them in the game room.

Then I headed out with my friends. About an hour and a half later, my father in law came into the games room and saw me, he asked me who was watching my daughter. I told him that the sister was still in the room, and he got super mad at me and said I was being totally irresponsible.

He becomes mad at her for lying, and thinks something is going on. I tell her she should tell him the truth about me, that I've been hanging out with her as just friends for the past years and that I wish to meet him so we could square things out and ease the tension. She says she wants to as well.

Anyways, the day before the concert she texts me and asks if it's okay that we don't go after all. I ask her what's up, and she tells me she and her boyfriend had stopped fighting about her lying about me, and that she doesn't want to light that fire again.

I then say that I respect that, and I don't wish to get in the middle of something, but ask if the others are still going, because I'd really like to hang out with them and get to know them better. She then proceeds to say that everyone's still going, but she doesn't want me to come because of her boyfriend. I then say I feel left out and mistreated, and she says she knows that, but still wishes I will respect her situation.

She seemed supportive at first (using correct pronouns and my chosen name) she even said she would stay with me through my transition, I told her not to spread the word because my Dad could ship me off to conversion therapy if he heard about this.

At first I was happy to have told her but when I woke up I was flooded with messages from literally everybody in my year. Some where nice offering make up tips and the like, but some where calling slurs such as tranny or trap. And then I realised that there is a high likelihood that this is all going to get back to my Dad via people in my year telling their parents about the situation and then I’m royally screwed.

I messaged my ex asking if she told anyone. She claimed to have only told a few. I then asked where literally everybody in my year knows now. She told me to grow up and how accepting people are. I then reminded her of my VERY conservative dad and she responded with an eye roll emoji. That really pissed me off so I said “At least my biological parents give a shit about me and didn’t just sell me out to some random ass family” she left me on read after this and according to her friend she was crying on FaceTime. 

In hindsight I could see she meant well by telling her friends but I specifically told her not to because of the consequences that would unfold if the word got around. I feel like an asshole for what I just said but I suppose it’s up for you to decide.

EDIT: To all of these people coming into my DMs saying I’m a privileged white boy.... first of all I’m African American (Light skin) living in a lower middle class household, secondly you are intentionally misgendering me, so shut the fuck up.

EDIT 2: Dads yelling my name from downstairs, he wants me to bring him my phone. Right now I’m deleting/logging out of all things that point towards me being trans. So this will probably be my last post on this account.

EDIT 3: So I got found out and kicked out of my house by my Dad (better than the alternative I guess). I have packed myself a bag with the essentials passport, birth certificate, etc and on July 21st my auntie (Moms side) will drive down from Vancouver to Seattle (the city I live in) to pick me up so I can live with her. But as of now I’m homeless and plan on checking into a shelter. This is going to my last post on this account for a while.

3458,Asshole,"I (28 M) was cooking a homemade dinner for me and my girlfriend (24 F). Nothing too fancy, homemade fettuccine Alfredo and some homemade garlic bread. We’ve lived together in an apartment for about a year now, and we get along great 99.9999% of the time. 

I had spent about half an hour cooking at this point, and the bread was running a bit behind. The pasta was about halfway done, and I hadn’t even started the bread, so I start preheating the oven as I prep the bread and continue watching the sauce and pasta. I admit, my lack of preparation was a fail, but I thought I could save it. 

The oven had preheated right as I finished prepping the bread, and the pasta still had another few minutes to go, so I’m thinking, “hell yeah, I can totally get this bread a little toasty as I drain the pasta and prep the plates.” I open the oven, and I see this red silly putty looking goop covering the inside of the oven and my glass lasagna pan filled with this red goop. 

As I realize what I was witnessing wasn’t some alien silly putty, I yell, “what the?!?”

 “Goddamnit...”

“You put..” I couldn’t finish my sentences due to the shock.

My girlfriend ran up and said, “What?”

In an annoyed and flabbergasted tone, I finally finish my sentence, “you put plastic in the oven?”

“This oven is probably ruined now, and I’m going to have to pay for it when we move out” I continued.

My girlfriend replied with, “don’t act like it’s my fault, you’re the one who turned on the oven without checking it first.”

At which point I responded, “I shouldn’t have to check the oven because plastic never should have been in there in the first place.”

My girlfriend got angry and said I was an asshole for trying to entirely blame her. I told her I wasn’t necessarily trying to blame her, but that we should both agree not to put plastic in the oven. At which point my girlfriend angrily ran off and jumped in the shower. I am currently eating my half planned dinner alone. The sauce turned out great, so there’s that.

So Reddit, am I the asshole?

6316,Not the A-hole,"For background, I was born in China, but was adopted as an infant by a white family. I have little knowledge of Chinese culture or language and never really ""felt"" Chinese. It's caused some weird issues where I wonder if I should feel more loyal to my birth country, despite being culturally very white.

My very good friend and roommate spent their life until middle/high school in China, then came to the US for high school and university. We currently don't see each other in person over the summer, but we text every day.

I recently posted on my instagram story a photo that said ""#FreeHongKong"". Not long after, my friend texted me a fairly long rant about how they don't like how US media is portraying the situation, saying, ""the way US writes the issue just makes me so fucking mad"" and how the US ""just thinks it's China doing bad well no it's not!!!!"".

I replied, ""...I considered blocking u from seeing my story because you're my friend and I don't want to argue about this with u! We are primed to hold different opinions from the start and I don't wanna fight about it"".

After a couple more texts from them I then said ""I don't expect either of us to change our opinions so we don't have to talk about it lol"".

At the time, I meant ""I value our friendship more than a political argument that is bound to end up as an actual fight"" and ""I'm not going to try to convince you to turn against your home country, but I would rather you not try to convince me to take China's side"".  

However, upon re-reading, I can see how what I said can easily be misconstrued as ""I refuse to change my opinion and I don't want to hear your point of view"". And I realize that me admitting I wanted to block them from seeing my #FreeHongKong post didn't help.

We agreed to drop the topic, but they were unusually cold to me afterwards and now we haven't texted/interacted on social media for a longer than usual time.

I feel like I sounded like the typical close-minded American who immediately thinks China=communist baddies, but I also believe China really is the bad guy in this situation.

My friends told me I should give him it for €10 as I already paid for it and my money is gone either way and I might as well make €10 out of it. I said if he wants the game so badly why not make it a profitable situation for the both of us and pay me €35.

7513,Everyone Sucks,"I am taking a few courses at my college this summer, to help lighten the load come fall. This one professor had a decent review on [RateMyProfessor.com](https://RateMyProfessor.com), but one thing a lot of students definitely said was that he’s a hard ass about his cellphone/distractions policy. Now, I don’t care about that. Summer sessions are shorter, so you need to focus more and sped a lot more time in class, learning the material.

The thing is, this professor, if he seems someone on their cellphone or suspects they’re using their laptop for anything other than notes, will stop the lecture to go over and yell at them. This happens multiple times, throughout the class. It gets annoying, disrupts class and basically ruins whatever we’re doing. I get it’s disrespectful and that it’s on these students too, but if he just ignored it (especially as they’re doing it silently-no music or anything, I don’t even know they’re doing it until the professor is yelling-and it’s not bothering us), we could move along.

Today, he did it quite a few times within the first half hour of class. I got so frustrated with him, because we barely got through the first bit of the lecture and I felt like I was back in high school, not a university classroom. I let out an audible grumble and the professor gave me a look. I asked “Can we just go on with class?” He said, “When this student puts their phone away.” I said “You stopping class every time someone takes their phone out, takes away from us learning. It’s more annoying than a cellphone, to be honest.” He started on the syllabus and I just said I didn’t want to argue, I just wanted to learn.

After class, we all got an e-mail about the policies again and if we “had any issues with how he ran his classroom, to please see him after class”.

I don’t know if I made things better or worse. The class is over next week, thank God, I just had to say something because I feel like I learned so little in this class. (Btw, I have never been yelled at by him before this entire session, so I’m not being bitter about it or anything. I’m just being annoyed about having to stop class.) Was I an asshole for speaking up? He’s making it out that I was disrespectful for doing so.",119,291,0.96,AITA for telling my professor he's disrupting the class?,cjfj0f,2019-07-29 18:48:45,ESH,2230,AITA,"The narrator is taking summer courses at college and is frustrated with a professor's strict policy on cellphones, which results in frequent disruptions during lectures.

11400,Not the A-hole,"This post requires a fair amount of context. 

I had a friend who I'll refer to as F. F has a super difficult home life. Her parents are abusive, she has untreated depression and anxiety, she lives in a house with a lot of drugs and alcohol and it's overall just an awful living situation. My living situation is close to perfect. I live alone with my Dad (who makes a really good income- enough to support a family of 4-5 easily, so we don't struggle) who I get alone with extremely well. My Dad has never smoked, doesn't drink and certainly never does drugs. I don't have any mental health issues and I truly love my life.

Recently F has been distant. A couple of days ago she was EXTREMELY rude. She followed me around for the day constantly butting into conversations that she wasn't even involved in by saying ""I don't care"". I didn't snap at her, or really do anything because I know some people have worse days then others.

I was however talking to F about how I might have to put down one of my pets soon (a rat, but this rat literally means the world to me.) and she once again butts in with ""I don't care"".

I still didn't comment on it, because I'm more mature then that and I refuse to lose my cool over 3 words repeated over and over again. However, about 5 minutes later we were all cracking jokes/sharing funny stories and I mentioned how the day before I ""lost"" one of my rats (they all come when they're called, and if they don't, my dog loves them and she'll find them in an instant - my dog would never hurt them, she just likes to watch them). Pretty much she jumped off my table because I left them and she went after me. Before I could finish the story (she had jumped high onto my tv unit and was licking the TV) F suddenly blurts out ""Good, I hope she died"" and continued on cracking jokes like before.

I looked at her in obvious disgust, stood up and said that I wouldn't be talking to her again and that was extremely inappropriate for her to say something like that to me, especially so soon after I was talking about my pet needing to be put down. I told her that just because she has a bad day doesn't give her ANY right to behave this way to another human let alone a friend. She responded with ""I don't care"". I walked away and I haven't talked to her since.

She found me later that day and tried to apologise but I shot that down straight away by simply telling her I meant what I said earlier and I walked away yet again.

I know she was being completely childish but I also NEVER snap at people. I don't raise my voice and I do feel I might be overreacting.

6788,Asshole,"This is my first ever post on this sub and I figured it's probably a good idea to use a throwaway so I don't give my wife another reason to be pissed at me. 

She was hosting a party at our house on Saturday. It was honestly more of a work event and she was super excited about it because she wanted it be our first ""mature"" party (meaning their were cocktails/wine as opposed to a keg, little sandwiches as opposed to pizza and our new hot tub was off limits so no bikinis either...I was joking with her that it sounded like the ""no-fun-arty"" which she found mildly amusing the first time I said it but the next 10000, not so much). 

So she got home Friday and worked until almost 2AM preparing and storing all the food she wanted to serve. There was some sort of work emergency at 7AM so she had to go in and I didn't even realize she was gone until I woke up at about 10. She texted me at like 5 and said she was having the most awful day ever and said she was thinking about cancelling the party. I told her that I would help in whatever way I could. She said it would be awesome if I cleaned up. 

I know me and my wife have very different cleaning standards but I very honestly did the best I could. I cleaned up all our mail that accumulates, cleaned the bathroom to what I thought was spotless, wiped down the kitchen and even started to warm up all the food she prepared. 

She ended up getting home at 6:45 and jumped right in the shower. Guests started showing up at 7 and it didn't even occur to me that I was still wearing my dirty cleaning clothes as I was greeting and chatting with her guests.  

She came out and in a stern ""mom voice"" she demanded to talk to me in the bed room. She laid into me like no one's business. I mean a brief laundry list of all my offenses: 

1. not wearing appropriate clothes. She didn't give me credit that I had been cleaning right until 7 because:

2. There was dog hair apparently everywhere, including the couch and there were piles of where it builds up next to the furniture. I had completely forgot to vacuum and everyone was getting dog hair on their clothes from sitting on the couch. 

3. I guess I missed some huge pee spots on the toilet.

4. I had missed her text that I needed to go get ice. 

5. I guess instead of warming up these salmon/cream cheese wheels I was just supposed to take them out but I put them in the oven and ruined them. 

6. and she reminded me of no-fun-arty.

Even with all that, the party went off just fine but it's Wednesday now and she is still made at me and says that my behavior and the jokes in the weeks leading up to the party show that I didn't even care how much it meant to her and my behavior that day makes her think I don't even care about her.

I might have hoarding tendencies (and I don't think I realized how bad until now), and am generally lazy when it comes to cleaning. I have a 2 year old, and my boyfriend is the type to do what I ask, but doesn't go too far out of the way to do much more. He is an excellent father, and will happily do any baby things. But usually our weekly cleaning is: I do laundry 5 times a week, tidy up, pet stuff (daily), and clean up messes. He usually does baby stuff, he sweeps/mops every few weeks, does some tidying, and sometimes helps with sorting laundry.
We usually switch off on cleaning bathrooms and kitchen, though he usually does the kitchen.
Anyway, he hired a cleaning lady today and after 4 hours she charged $500 and left. I took a shower and couldn't find my toothbrush and deodorant. Weird, but $20 bucks to replace and sucks because both were fairly newish (cue freak out 1- we're too broke to replace new stuff).
I go out for a smoke and I look in one of the trash bags by the back door. I see a bra and a baby hanger (I end up buying new ones fairly often because my child has too many clothes and I lose them) (cue freak out 2- I have 6 bras).
So I spent an hour sorting through the 6 bags by the back door (the trash bin is full and tomorrow's  mission) and find an assortment of things including my ski jacket, a set of personalized oven mits my sister bought for me in Italy, a litter box scoop (and another is still missing), 2 necklaces, both of my belts, a number of baby toys (mostly bits and accessories to things), more clothes, and a number of toiletry samples.
So far none of his stuff is missing and beyond a few socks I haven't seen anything of his either.
He went to bed angry because he has to go to work in the morning, and I'm considering sleeping on the couch because I'm not sure I'll be able to go to sleep anyway.

Usually the day itself goes...alright, but then it's time to load it back up and the same process repeats but 10X worse. Anytime my husband or I try to help, we get treated like we're little kids being yelled at and told we're doing everything wrong (mind you, he and I have gone boating for years, we could take it out by ourselves and be fine. They just want the control). 

Anyways, on to the AITA. I work in customer service, so I was very careful and mindful with telling my mom that while we appreciate the offer, we probably wont go boating again due to the negative experiences we've had in the past. While we have no hard feelings about previous times, we're not really inclined to put ourselves through that stress again. We're happy to spend time with them doing other activities, just not boating. My mom replied hours later saying she cant believe we're so unforgiving and aside from hanging up when she was about to cry on the follow up call with my husband, hasn't said a word to us (besides a group text that they are selling the boat). So Reddit, AITA?

3694,Asshole,"3 years since the split. We share them 50/50. My ex has a job with long, shit hours but because of that they have a lot of money. On their weeks they barely spend time with the kids unless it’s the weekend, but the kids LOVE my ex and think their house is like a playground. I spend a lot of time with them and teach them so many things but it’s like my house is the boring, normal life house and ex’s house is the party house. The kids are 4, 6 and 10. 

For example, my ex hired two babysitters to take care of the kids while they’re at work. Except ex is paying extra to use Elsa and Anna impersonators instead of regular babysitters. 4 and 6 year olds LOVE frozen and always tell me about them. 

10 year old loves to play games. Ex I think has a big projector screen to play games on, so now my son is treating my TV like the downgraded version. He likes to invite his friends to play at ex’s house but not my house as much. 

Ex takes them to Disneyland roughly once a month. I can’t afford that. 

I mostly make meals for the family. Ex has a lot of food delivered, never properly learned to cook. The kids have asked me to order food from the places my ex likes but again, I can’t afford that. Once a week or so is fine but regularly spending $100 on the family’s meal is too much.

Lots of things like this. I had enough and sat the kids down to tell them the important thing in life is time together.  I told them that when ex pays for these things all the time that is not the way to a happy family and it’s better to have a parent who can be with you than a parent who is at work all the time. 

Today I got a text saying we need to talk from the ex because the kids told them. I haven’t answered yet.

2074,Not the A-hole,"I \[23M\] am getting married next summer and my fiancee \[22F\] and I are still in the planning stages of our wedding - including still divvying out roles for our family/friends. My cousin Meagan has had 2 kids since getting married a few years ago, Lily and Michael. Given that they are the youngest family members out of both my fiancee's family and mine, we were talking about our wedding during a family BBQ and how the guest list was coming along. I let them know that it's slowly but surely coming together and in that moment talked about possibly having Michael be our ring bearer and Lily be our flower girl. Everyone in our family thought this would be a fun/cute idea . . .

 . . . Everyone except my Aunt Bri and her 12 year old son (my cousin) Andrew. Andrew is a brat; he is a really an only child despite having two older siblings and always throws fits whenever he doesn't get his way - like dragging himself on the ground, hiding/running away, ignoring people, and pouting/crying. My Aunt Bri and Uncle Ken hardly do anything to address these fits other than threatening to go home. They don't give a shit about what kind of video games he plays, how he talks back to them or the rest of our family (light cursing and addressing family by first name rather than Aunt \[My mom's name\] or Grandma \[My Grandma's name\]). There is no way around this, kid is just a pain in the ass. He was born well after my cousin Meagan and her older brother Patrick were (age difference of at least 12+ years between them) and so has sort of always gotten his way growing up with virtually no siblings in the picture. 

Later during my family visit, my  grandma pulled me aside and asked if I had any plans to include Andrew in our wedding in anyway. I asked why. My grandma then mentioned that I made my Aunt/Uncle/Andrew a little upset by offering my cousins toddlers roles in the wedding but not offering Andrew a special role in the wedding as a little groomsmen or something else and that I should really ask him/do something special for him like get him a toy while asking.

I turned to my Grandma and my mom - who was also in on the conversation - and I said ""No. I honestly don't think Andrew deserves any kind of special role. Kid is a spoiled brat to be honest and I just can't see him not throwing some kind of fit or crying about something on the day of our wedding."" My mom agreed with me as she has always felt the same way about her nephew and like me, felt that he would not be respectful/behaved and would try to make it about him - the way he always tries to. My grandma, however, slightly disagreed and said that I should really consider it and that ""he is family.""

Also I apologize about formatting I’m on mobile. 


Hi! I recently moved into a rent house in February. Prior to moving in I made an agreement with the landlord that I would clean the house, pressure wash, and take care of the yard for exchange of a discounted deposit and rent. The previous tenants of the home left without paying and left it a wreck. Anyways, the yard had been overgrown for the better part of a year, so very high grass and weeds. I don’t have a huge yard but it’s definitely pretty big, I’d say around 30x50 combined. My across the street neighbor was friendly at first, the guy had been laid off work for 5 years and wasn’t all there but we often chatted everyday when I got home from work. He was injured and let me know he gets paid about $4,000 monthly. He offered to cut my yard just like his, and his looked great for $60. I gladly paid him because after work, cleaning the house, and taking care of my daughter I was relatively busy. We had a pretty fair relationship, he would call me if he saw any body sketchy near my house, or pick up my garbage can out of the road, just neighbor stuff. Last week he asked when I wanted him to cut my grass again because it wasn’t bad whatsoever. I told him that, he doesn’t need to worry about it because it hasn’t overgrown. I came home from work that night and it was cut so I went over and knocked and thanked him and we spoke. He asked about these boat trailers I had in the driveway that belonged to my landlord and if she was willing to sell them. I spoke with my landlord yesterday, and gave him a call this morning just letting him know the information about the trailers, he then texted me asking me if I was planning to pay him for cutting my grass last week. I didn’t want to seem rude, so I agreed and asked if $20 was okay, my neighbor responded by saying he’s only going to charge me $50 for it. I let him know that was a bit expensive, and I’ll pay him this time but in the future I’ll cut it myself.

Not yet, which in my mind isn't a good sign. We put in our drinks and appetizer order, and continue to wait.

30 minutes later (45 total), R finally comes by. We've noticed that since then, he had seated and taken the dinner orders of two other couples who came in after us. Feeling completely ignored and very hungry, BF and I are displeased.

Over the course of our two hour meal (service was very slow, but I don't know how much of that was R's fault), R comes by a total of two more times.

14994,Asshole,"For some reason, my girlfriend really loves picnics. Recently, now that the weather has gotten sunny, we've started going on picnics around three times a week. I'm honestly not that big of a fan of picnics because it seems like too much of a bother to pack a hamper and lug it all the way to a park and all that. The amount of work it takes to go on a picnic has only increased because my girlfriend has started asking me to help her prepare food. I love my girlfriend, and I appreciate her. But a part of appreciating someone is letting them do what they're good at. In my girlfriend's case, this is cooking. I could talk for days about how good her sandwiches are, especially the type with crusty bread and olive oil. For the two years in which we have been dating, cooking has been strictly her domain.

The trouble started around three weeks ago, when she asked me to chop the veggies and eggs for the pasta salad. I was okay to oblige but her requests have become bigger and bigger. I was tasked with pretty much assembling whole sandwiches, frying chicken, and baking cookies. My girlfriend knows that I don't like cooking, and I thought she knew that it was her job. I've never asked her to vacuum because I know that it's my job. I eventually told my girlfriend how I felt about having to cook for her and I thought that we both had a rational and fulfilling discussion. She may have seemed a bit reluctant about cooking for picnics herself, but she did agree that we would both stick to our own jobs. Unfortunately, she lied. Yesterday, before a picnic, my girlfriend asked me to open and cube a watermelon. I reminded her of our agreement and that's when we started arguing. My girlfriend is very mild mannered, I've never heard her actually get into a temper before. I was very taken aback and a bit miffed that she would go back on our agreement and then proceed to yell at me. We ended up not going on a picnic and I ordered a pizza for the both of us. I told her that going on picnics were more trouble than they were worth, especially because we had gotten into an argument over it.

3714,Asshole,"To be honest I've always been very insecure about my general self. As expected I was never particularly popular in elementary and middle school, but I still had friends. But then my family moved to a new state.

I went to a small high school and in mid-ninth grade, I became one of the popular girls. I was shocked but delighted, until I realized they only let me in the group to be the laughingstock they needed at any given moment. I hated it, but my love for being popular was stronger.

As expected we bullied a lot of other girls, but one in particular we bullied very harshly at least once a week. Let's call her Sarah. I'll admit that I bullied her a little more harshly and frequently than any of the other girls, because I was desperate to have my own laughingstock, all to my self. I also knew that Sarah was more confident, had a better relationship with her friends, and was kinder than I was, which just gave me more incentive to hate her.

Sarah eventually had enough of all that bullying she got and was homeschooled for 12th grade. After I graduated, I spent the summer distancing myself from everyone from that high school. I'm now in my second year of college with different people, and I have a couple of friends, similar to my state in elementary and middle school.

I try to explain to her that I don't mind her using it, and I said a couple days ago she could, but that doesn't mean she can just demand it from me in such an entitled way.
She then called me ""Power hungry"" and ""Wanting to control everything"" - she did (very condescendingly) say ""OP, Can I *please* use your computer?"" and I was going to let her use it but then she continued to insult me and attempted to unplug stuff from my laptop and take it. I stopped her, told her ""You know what? You can't use it. Learn some manners."" and began plugging my laptop back in.
She left in a huff and said, ""Fine. I don't need you.""

I know it's not my place to teach her manners, but I also don't have an obligation to let her use my property. She does this quite a lot, demanding things or saying ""I need to use this."" rather than asking. She uses the excuse ""I'm just direct/blunt"" but I try to tell her you can be direct but still be polite. Problem is, I feel bad because I want to help her, but I don't like being treated  that way.
Anyways, am I the asshole?

Where I work, there is a mentally challenged couple who were unfairly kicked out of their apartment building illegally. They have been living in their small car with their dog and cat in the parking lot of our work for roughly 4 months. The animals have food and water but the car is disgusting (clothes, animal urine and poo) and they animals don't get out of the car very often. They were in the car all winter and hotter weather is on it's way. The couple have told me they are searching for an apartment, but haven't found anywhere to live. They are good people and they love the animals to the point where they would be devastated if they lost the animals. And I feel horrible about it, but those animals deserve a better home and animals in my town get adopted quickly to good people. At least two other coworkers have shared the same thought. So, would I be the asshole if I called animal control and had the animals removed from their care?
EDIT (included in the comments): For those saying none of us care about the people, some more info. We (the coworkers) collectively have tried to connect them with lawyers who can work on the legal situation, the couple never went. We have fed them, we have given them numbers to landlords (mine included) and apartment complexes, we have told them about city housing programs, they don't call and they don't go. Several coworkers have shelled out money to fix their car, buy tires, buy food (it's min. Wage so we can't do a lot). Coworkers offer their homes for showers and laundry and a night to sleep. We have tried, but they just don't do anything with the help. Also, they have a housing option to stay with a relative, but have refused.

14751,Not the A-hole,"I have stage four cancer and receive chemo every Monday. During these sessions my doctor pops by to chat about symptoms and we can discuss treatment plans and such. These visits are always held in an open room with other patients sitting next to you and nurses drawing blood at the same time. 

The past few weeks I’ve been experiencing some rather annoying (TMI) symptoms and radiotherapy was put on the table as a possibility. All I know about radiotherapy I had learned from my own research, and was a bit overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information. I mentioned that I wasn’t sold on going through with it on top of my chemotherapy as I’m already pretty wiped out and don’t see much benefit. 

I had a visit with another doctor on my team who really stressed that radiotherapy seemed the best option. After this, I spoke with my nurse about it and decided I would like more information before deciding. 

My main-doctor is a very busy woman, I get that, and these weekly visits are normally very short just to make sure I’m healthy enough to get the go-ahead for treatment. Last week we had planned she would stop by for a bit longer than the usual 5-10 minutes so that we could discuss radiotherapy more in-depth, and she could outline her exact plans. When she came in I had a notepad full of questions and I was ready and prepared. When I brought it up she said it wasn’t on the table anymore and we shouldn’t worry about it. I mentioned a few things my nurse had said regarding the treatment and she immediately shoots those down, claiming the nurse was ‘completely wrong’ and ‘didn’t know what she was talking about’. 

To me this felt rather rude, and probably could have been handled better. 

This morning she popped in again and I stressed my symptoms were starting to affect my mental health. I was just asking if there was anything we could do to help. She brought up radiotherapy as a possibility...I was pretty mad at this point, as she told me previously it was off the table. So I brought up some of the questions I had before and was constantly met with, “we’ll discuss that when it comes to it,” or something of the sort. 

I then reminded her I wasn’t sold on radiotherapy as a whole, and that I wanted all the information before making a decision to go forward. I do not want to be bombarded right before with information and feel overwhelmed. (Which has happened a couple times in the past). She got a kind of annoyed look and started just going into auto-pilot and started describing the process of radiotherapy and when I would ask questions she would interrupt me and say she’ll get to it. 

I asked her to leave as I was just too frustrated to listen.

8345,Not the A-hole,"This is my first time posting something, bear with me. English is not my first language, throwaway.

So, this happened like 7 years ago when I was 17(F). This needs a little bit of back story, my parents since my father moved to another town (I was 10) for work had a really weird relationship. As in, my father was cheating. They were together when he was in town, it happened like every 2 months if even that(he lived 1h30 away, just to show you how much he sucks)

&#x200B;

So it was a public holiday, he was in town, they decided to have dinner at home with me, my brother, my mother’s “best friend” (MBFF), herself and my beloved father. All went well, my father and the MBFF had a lot to drink, we were all talking until it got kinda late and me and my brother had to go to bed because we have school the next day.

&#x200B;

I wake up thinking oh I need to pee, innocent, thinking that’s why my brain woke me up. Ear some noises, still not fully awake, go to the living room, see my mom sitting on the couch, she always sleeps on the couch and realize the noises are coming from my “parents” bedroom.

Realize MBFF is in there with my father. Now, I **HATE** my father with all of my heart and I **despise** MBFF, I was not letting that happen.

&#x200B;

I get to the bedroom door, which is closed, and this is how it goes:

&#x200B;

**Me:** what the fuck is happening?

**\*silence\***

**Me:** I will ask again, what the fuck do you think you’re doing?

**F:** OP. go away. Go to sleep.

**M:** Not happening, you have 1 minute to get out of this house or I will get you out myself. (no way would I be able to, my father is a fat fuck and so is she. Didn’t care).

**F:** JUST LEAVE

**M:** Listen here you crazy motherfucker, I thought you couldn’t go lower on the Shitty father scale but you somehow manage to find a new level. I’m serious, you get the FUCK out right now.

*(While I was screaming I was also kicking the door and simulating I was about to open)*

F and MBFF open the door, she’s crying and he’s red like a tomato. Still with only is pants on, thinking that he would just open the door so SHE could leave but that’s not fucking happening.

**M:** You think she’s the only one leaving? No, **YOU** are also leaving and I do not want to see that ugly face of yours until they are lowering you down to your grave.

He left, didn’t say a word. 

My mother was still friends with that bitch for a couple of months after that.

As for my father, I’ve seen him plenty of times and we now have a somewhat friendly relationship. I also moved countries, that makes it easier.

&#x200B;

I’m posting this now because I’ve been thinking about it lately.

&#x200B;

I was tasked to get the apartment in a reasonable state for the security deposit, when I found out that he hadn't cleaned the apartment in 1+ year(s) I was worried, when I entered the kitchen area was disgusting. E.g literal food waste not being moved. Black mold was also collecting in the top corners of the rooms. Obviously my mum didn't get the security deposit back.

For the past year, and the most recent months he has ballooned it weight. 300kg is my estimate as he refuses to go on scales. I have offered to go to the gym with him or help him on a diet but he refuses. All he does is eat and play Xbox all day. Nevermind that he has a minifridge full of energy drinks that he has replaced water with. 

My brother drenches T-shirts when walking 100 meters.

Last month he was diagnosed with type 2 diabities and refuses to take it seriously. He also complains of having sleep apnea. I believe he falls asleep all the time as his body can't support his own weight while doing simple tasks.

Next month he starts University for the 3rd time doing social sciences for the 3rd time. As he didn't pass the first two times. My brother is jn £40,000 worth of debt from the University and doesn't take it seriously. 

Yesterday was is third appointment with his counselor. And all he does is post shitty quotes on Facebook about how mentally strong he is.

Our sons are 16 and 13 and our oldest, ‘Levi’, is stubborn bastard much like myself. Recently my husband and my brother were in the living room playing either Fifa or 2k19, I don't really care because either way my brother was getting his ass handed to him. He got mad and now he owes us a new TV because he put a controller sized hole in ours. The only other TV in the house is in our room (Levi wants to buy his own and our youngest doesn’t spend much time in his room to need one in there) so we have been spending a lot more time with the boys in our room the week watching tv or playing video games at the foot of our bed, we have no problem with this until it comes to my husband and I needing to talk privately. 

While our youngest will leave when we tell him to, Levi will just kinda stay there and tell us go ahead and have our conversation and he’d act as a ‘non-biased party’ just in case of an argument. He’ll have this shit-eating grin on his face. Normally just giving a look will get him out but he’s learned that just not looking at us is effective against it. My husband will wind up  just carrying him out after a few minutes and lock the door behind him but I came up with a new idea that requires less of a hassle. Whenever Levi chooses not to leave when we tell him to, we’ll talk about the previous night of sex and he’ll be out of the room within seconds, grumbling and huffing under his breath and then we’ll have our conversation without interruptions. I would be lying if I said I didn't find the look on his face hilarious. We never go into to extreme detail when we talk about it, just enough to get him out.

I told my friend today about how we get rid of him and she told me we were being pretty shitty parents and that we’re going to scar him forever and that what we were doing is just as bad as him walking in on us.

He was a regular at our house and our son to his as well

My son would usually mention his friend and sometimes his girlfriend (whenever he wasnt around ) regularly during normal chit chat.


So today the curiousity got the better of me so I just went and asked ""what happened with your friend lately.""

Then he hesitates then admit that while his friend and her were in a relationship she was secretly having sex with my son THROUGHOUT THEIR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP FOR A YEAR !


I didnt want to believe that he could do something so cold like that until I got more upset and kept asking if it was true. He finally admitted it and it and showed me a conversation that he had with his friend on the day his friend found out about it admitting it to him.

Now the thing is is that his friend didnt find out about the cheating until AFTER they had broken up for unrelated reasons. My son said that it was his friends NEW girlfriend's friends were the ones to tell him. My son never did. Which made me mad. 


Now normally my son and I are like two peas but that really bothered me and kind of hurt me a little TBH when he told me that. Im not sure what was going through my head but I got angry af cussed him out called him a ""selfish POS backstabbing low life"" etc etc 


""I hope your friend clobbers the hell outta you you cunt shit""!!!!!.

Recently another store that sells the same items has come up for sale, but it lacks the good reputation and excellent location that my husband’s shop has. It’s smaller and ticked behind another business in a non-touristy area, while my husband’s current shop is in a tourist heavy pedestrian mall. 

He wants to buy the smaller shop (mainly because a friend is selling it) at the same time that he buys the shop that makes money.

They can barely keep one store staffed, I don’t think it’s going to be possible to staff two.

11932,No A-holes here,"The very last semester in my school was going great regarding my GPA, until one of my (female) teachers decided to ruin it. We were given assignments that were extremely important for our grades and thus I tried my best to write a good essay. She graded it as 7 points, a C- (15 being the best in German schools), even though I was certain that it should've been above 12 points/B+. I showed my essay to several other teachers to see if I might've gotten overconfident, but they agreed that it should've been at least a B.
I asked if she was willing to talk about the grades in a one-on-one conversation and she agreed. On that day, I was very well prepared and gave her clear evidence why it couldn't have been a C-. She stood right there in shock and might've understood that she was too harsh. Nevertheless, she got extremely angry and told me how disrespectful and rude I was.
What was anger at first turned to tears in seconds and she started crying. I was very confused and asked if she was okay, however she left without clarifying whether she would change the grade or not. While I have to admit my voice is deep and can be loud at times (especially in that situation since I was in a rather bad mood), I wasn't trying to be disrespectful. 
I additionally want to mention that she's usually a very nice, understanding and funny teacher...but to me, it seems as if she's emotionally unstable and isn't able to react in stress situations very well (a similar incident has happened in the past).

Her favourite insult she slings at me for anything thing I do is that I'm 'selfish'. Everything I do she sees as an attack on her. 

I am sick so I decided to wait 3 hours before doing a short A level maths assignment given today and was due at 3pm. So when I decided to drag myself out of bed, my books were missing. She had taken and fucked off with them. I was pissed. She has a habit of just doing what she wants with my  stuff. She had a psycho mental breakdown every week and everyone has to walk on eggshells and she can do no wrong because shes ""soft and senstive"".

I had enough of her bullshit and phoned her, asked where the fuck my books were and how inconsiderate she was. I wasn't kind and I wasn't calm. After all the times I've been called selfish, she does this. ""Just do it on paper"" she said. ""How the fuck am I supposed to do it on paper if you have my fucking textbook?"" I replied. ""I'll take a picture."" She didn't. Her boyfriend is crashing here at our house during covid and said he heard shouting, he was prodding me for my ""side of the story"". ""I'm guessing it's about [sister]"". I told him I don't want to talk about it, he asks ""why?"", because I didn't want to, I told him that. He always takes her side in everything regardless of me being in the right. He has harassed me in a city 5 hours away, asking me why I didn't include my sister in a shopping trip with a friend for fucking pasta and salad. He has told me _I have to change_  to accommodate my sister when he has a huge fight with her. Anything between them gets flinged to me and becomes my fault. Any insecurity my sister has, he flames me for it. So why do I want to find comfort in a person who just wants to take the other persons side immediately? 

He kept prodding and prodding and asking why I wouldn't tell him my ""side of the story"" when I snapped and said, ""You are not my friend. You are [sister]'s bf and I'm [sister]'s sister. Everything revolves around [sister] in our relationship. You take her side regardless. I don't want to talk about my emotions with someone who isn't my friend. You are not my friend, so stop asking me.""

I ended up waiting until an hour before the thing was due for my sister to decide to drop it off. ""Here's your fucking books. I'm keeping your biology book because I need it.""

And of course she gets annoyed everytime I fail to help her despite my best efforts because I just never ever touched that OS and if she wants me to learn it I need her phone for a couple weeks.

The same goes for our brand new Smart TV, which I never touch nor use nor see. I have told my parents that I have no idea how to use it or their weird modem with their special internet channels(mostly Russian shows).

9098,No A-holes here,"Context:
Ive been working at a food establishment that is called, let's say Hizza Put as a shift manager for about two years now. 

On Sunday night around 10:45pm
(Closing time is at 11pm) a Native family of about 11 people come in and ask if we are open and tell me they want to dine in.  Now we dont have an official closing time for our dining area but my boss says to ""Use your descresion"" so given that it takes about 12 minutes for me to make these pizzas and get them out of the oven I let them know that I can't seat them but I can make their order to go. They agree and I put the order in the oven.

     Everything would be fine if that is all that happened. Now as those pizzas were in the oven two caucasian men came in around 10:57 and ordered a carryout pizza (A little annoying but whatever, ita just a carryout). One chatted with me for a bit before I went and made their order. After putting their order in the oven they asked me for drinks while they waited so I gave them each a soda. Native family's pizzas come out, I give them their order they leave (11:01ish). Now the two mens pizza comes out (11:12ish) I give it to them in a box and go back to finish up on dishes. 

      I finish dishes and realize the two men are still sitting and chatting and drinking their sodas in the store. I realize they must not know we are closed but I forgot to tell them and I hate confrontation and kicking people out so I decide to mop the floors and then if they're not gone I would let them know they have to leave. I finish the floor. Let them know that it is now 11:25 and they will have to go home. They apologize and express that they thought we closed at 12pm. They take their stuff and leave. 

     Now, somewhere in the time this happened one of the Native family members that had left drove by and saw that these two men were still in the store and got very very angry I didnt seat their family, called me a racist and is currently trying to get me fired.

9939,Not the A-hole,"Soo. My wife and I just had our first child, and we couldn’t be happier about it! We both have a strict religious background and that brings us all here.

First of all, that religion is extremely conservative about everything (for example birth control, listening to rhytmic music and even watching TV is forbidden). We both have religious families and they have brought us into that cult. However, my wife and I decided that we will not raise our child with their rules, because we don’t believe in those. Almost all of our friends are from that religion too and all of my friends are very conservative. We have no problem telling this to my wifes friends, because they are very open-minded about these things, but my friends are the problem.

They stalk me and remind me if I haven’t attented in cults events and act like they are worried about the strength of my faith. I haven’t told them, that we don’t believe like they do anymore, because i’m afraid that they try to effect to my parents and siblings who are still in that shit. So in conclusion I have decided, that I will ghost them out of our lives. We already have moved to other town because my school is here, and i haven’t called them in few months. They have been calling me few times, but I haven’t answered them. I heard from some other people that my ”friends” have already spoke about me and my wife, that we are serving the wrong god and turning our backs to the realms of god.

So I just want to find the answer that am I being the asshole here, or should I be satisfied with my decision to keep my child apart from all of this?

Edit: Since few of you have asked about the religion, here are some ”rules” they have:

- no alcohol
- no rhytmic music
- no TV or movies or anything
- no opera or theatre
- no dancing (causes lust apparently)
- no premarital sex
- no birth control (I have 9 siblings)
- no moving together before marriage
- no kissing before marriage
- no swearing
- no make-up
- no pearcings or coloring your hair

18418,Not the A-hole,"So the wife bought me a dog for my birthday. It hasn’t arrived yet, the seller is driving her down next week when she is old enough to be separated. It’s not that I don’t love dogs, I do, we have a 12 year old dog she and I got together, and she’s my first baby. But we also have two children under the age of 5. One is still potty training and the other is a normal 5 year old with boundless energy, imagination and a million questions.

We both work full time (pre everything going on right now) but her job has stupid hours. She’s out of the house before 7 am and usually not home until 8/9 pm, so the bulk of the day to day family routine falls on me. So every day I get the kids up, dressed, fed and out the door by 730 on our way to school/daycare/work. Do my normal gig, then head off to get them back home. On the best of days I get home around 615/630 and start the pm routine to cook, feed, bathe, get them in bed and set ourselves up for the next morning all in the course of 2 hours. It’s hectic but somehow it works...most days.

So a a few months ago when the subject of getting a puppy came up (there was an opportunity to get a puppy from friends) I was adamantly against the idea. My position was there just wasn’t time in the day and with our lives I know that responsibility would fall squarely on me. At the moment I can not add one more thing to our already tight routine.

I also don’t think it’s fair to a puppy to be alone that long every day. Our dog is older and is content with the peace and quiet because when we’re all home it’s anything but! I agreed that when the kiddos were older and could realistically take on that responsibility or our job situation changed, I would be 100% on board, but as it is now I don’t want new dog. So we didn’t get the puppy at the time and I thought she agreed with me it was a bad idea

Until last night. My birthday is around the corner and the wife wanted to give me my gift early. She was excited about it and is the worst at keeping secrets. When I unwrapped the collar withstand picture of the puppy my enthusiasm did not match hers so now she’s upset.

But just recently, they posed a new, unconventional idea to me - that **I** be the donor.

Asking your brother to donate sperm for you might be an odd or even inappropriate request in most circumstances, but ours is a unique one - we are identical twins. We share 100% identical DNA, and thus any child born of my sperm would be related to my brother **every bit as much** as his own child from his own sperm would. This would not be the case with regular brothers, where the baby would be related as a nephew/niece to him. And because of this, the child wouldn’t find out about the “donation” from one of those home DNA tests so many people are taking now - my brother and I both would show up as the father on any DNA test because of our identical DNA.

My brother views having an identical twin as a great stroke of luck in this situation, and an opportunity to be able to have his own children after all.

She’s usually in something skimpy when she visits. I didn’t expect her to dress differently staying with us, but I also didn’t expect her to go from regular skimpy summer clothes to her bra and panties or short shorts and a bra. Still, it didn’t bother me because we grew up naked around each other all the time. 

Last night my husband asked me to talk to her. He said he isn’t comfortable with her walking around like that. I honestly don’t care why he isn’t, in my opinion, it’s his house and if he isn’t comfortable with it then it should stop. He said he’d just like her to throw a shirt on or some longer shorts, he’s not asking for her to completely dress like a nun. He also doesn’t care what she wears after he goes to bed, before he wakes up, or when he isn’t home. 

This morning I told her we’d like her to do that. I said while he’s at work she can wear whatever she wants but he isn’t comfortable seeing her wearing certain things. She completely lost it. She accused me of slut shaming her, being jealous of her body, and said it’s not her fault my husband is so attracted to her that he needs her to “change her life.” 

I don’t think it’s an issue of him being attracted to her, thinking she’s a slut, or me being jealous. I wouldn’t want to see his brother in his underwear either. And like I said before, IMO the reasoning doesn’t matter. 

She’s now currently stomping around and refusing to put clothes on. I’m ready to tell her to leave if she doesn’t like our guidelines. We’ve already gotten into it about asking her not to smoke weed in the house and to be quiet after our daughter goes to bed.

He phoned me back, so I answered ready to apologise and just forget about it (as said, petty argument. Fully acknowledge I was just being immature and insecure) and it happened again. This guy starts arguing with me also down the phone. So I just said ""I'm in a relationship with you, not your mate. I'll talk when you're home.""

He's tried ring me back multiple times but I don't wanna pick up cause I would never DREAM of letting a friend be disrespectful and get involved in our shit. 
It's not like it's the first time BF has admitted to his friend talking badly about me. 

But now guilt is setting in and I don't know if I'm being immature for waiting till he's home to sort this out or if I should just let him have me on loudspeaker so he has his turn of being petty and be backed up by his friend.

Am I the asshole?

13346,No A-holes here,"Last year a new teacher came to my school. We'll call him Mr. R.

I didn't have Mr. R for any classes, but I liked hanging out in his room, and I'd sit in there and bug him during frees. We had, I guess, a cordial relationship, wherein I would come in and sit in dead silence until the period ended, and sometimes he would sit at the table with me and play country music.

I Googled him one day, as I am prone to doing. I've done this with all of my other teachers (so do all my peers; teachers of Reddit, take note) and generally have found nothing of interest. This was not one of those times.

I looked him up on Youtube and found his channel from when he was, like, 15 years old, and it was full of videos of him, clearly being 15 years old. Nothing incriminating, but definitely cringey, and something I wouldn't want public.

*And then I sent it to my friends.*

This was a dick move, and I instantly felt guilty. I still feel very guilty for that matter. Eventually, after several weeks, I told Mr. R that his Youtube account was public, and he told me it was fine, but made it private a few weeks later. I did not talk to him about it anymore.

Anyways, all that is just for context.

Some time passed. A girl in my grade told me that Mr. R has a music career and told me to look him up. I did, and I found his music, and listened to it, and liked it. Then I downloaded all that I could find for easier listening, and then I stopped looking it up, except for maybe like, refreshing his FB every few months to see if he'd uploaded anything new.

This was all last year.

About a month ago, I cracked under the stress of feeling like I was sneaking around behind Mr. R's back, and I asked him for the tabs to one of the songs. He told me a very strong no. Several days later, Mr. R pulled me aside and told me to not look him up anymore.

It's been a few weeks since then, and I still feel terrible about this, and I'm fairly confident Mr. R didn't like me too much in the first place, but he *definitely* doesn't like me now. I want to go and apologize to him for being creepy, but I also don't want to remind him of my transgressions. Was I being exceptionally creepy? Is he being overly sensitive? Am I overthinking all of this?

Before anyone asks, I'm seventeen, and I'm 99% sure he's 25.

6029,Asshole,"I'm not sure where to start so I will lay out the facts. I apologize for the disorganized thoughts.

&#x200B;

I am 23 and recently graduated with a bachelor's degree. Currently, I am doing an internship that will turn into a job that pays $15 an hour (we live in Northern California) in two weeks. The pay is pretty low for a new grad and there are no benefits, but it will eventually lead into a slightly higher paying job with benefits after 6 months to a year. The job is also only about 30 hours a week which is okay with me because I will also be taking classes to continue my education. Another fact is that I am diabetic, so I pay an extra $400+ a month for medical insurance and supplies. After paying my bills each month I will not have a ton of money left over.

&#x200B;

My mom wants to teach me some responsibility by asking me to pay rent now that I am not a full-time student. $250 per month. Yes, I know that is ludicrously low, but at least hear all the details. I am trying to save up my money for graduate school which will cost me about $100k in tuition over two years, and that is not even factoring in food, rent, and other costs of living. I could use this $250 a month to put towards my future costs. I feel I NEED this money, while my mom does not. She is quite literally a multi-millionaire. Again she is wanting to teach me responsibility by making me take on my own finances (something I am fine with), but also make me pay rent to live in her house which is also the house I've lived in my entire life. I am not sure if it matters, but the house is in a middle-class neighborhood and we have always lived pretty frugally despite having money.

&#x200B;

Some other details to include are that every since high school I have been in charge of paying for my own hobbies and activities. My parents have financially supported me through my recent graduation. They paid for my tuition, food, medical insurance, diabetes supplies, car insurance (but not gas/maintenance), and possibly more.

&#x200B;

I am open to doing additional work around the house/for my mom instead of paying rent. This would mean work that I don't already do such as chores, cleaning etc., although I am not sure how much time I would have for that. Basically I am open to anything, but prefer to not pay actual money to my (wonderful) multi-millionaire mother.

&#x200B;

So am I the asshole for not wanting to pay her $250 in rent every month?

5483,Not the A-hole,"Quick backstory: I’m adopted. When I was 16 I met my biological mom. When I was 17 she told me she was pregnant and asked if I wanted “it”. A few days after I turned 18 she birthed my sister. Being 18 I did not feel comfortable taking on a newborn, especially as the sole caregiver; so I had to pass on raising my sister. She was adopted out to her biological dads sister. It was an open adoption.  Before my sister was 4, both her dad and our mom were dead. Her adoptive mother decided at that point that she was not going to tell her she’s adopted and that none of the family can see her. At our moms funeral I met 2 other sisters I had never met, and another brother. Our youngest brother was also there, but I had already met him. Sadly, we have another brother who passed away at 10, and 2 more siblings who are as lost as can be. (Police reports say they suspect that our mother sold those two on the black market -yeah, she had issues. That’s why we were all adopted out. All except the one who died at 10, actually.)

Present day: My baby sister turned 18 in early June and has no idea she’s adopted. I’m her sister and she has 2 other sisters and 2 brothers out here, and we all love her dearly and want to have contact with her. I did find her on Facebook and sent her a message wishing her a happy birthday, but I did not tell her the truth of who I am or how I know her. She hasn’t responded- probably because nobody responds to some stranger telling them happy birthday (especially when the birthday is not public on the profile, and she has never met me before.)

My question: will I be the asshole if I send her a second message saying (basically) “Hey. You are adopted. I am you sister. You have 5 more siblings who want to meet you. Sorry your mom didn’t tell you, but you’re grown up now and we want our sister back.”

???

EDIT: Since every single comment has said to talk to her mother, I need to make clear that this has been an ongoing conversation with her mom for 14+ years. Her mother will never tell her. Also that in an open adoption the adoptive parent has no right to keep that a secret. I absolutely refuse to never meet my own blood in person because some lady illegally decided she’s not allowed to know who she is. Also, in my last conversation with her mother she stated I could tell her whatever I want if ever I see her again, (implying that I won’t) so there is that.",104,195,0.88,WIBTA if I do the following...,cv6caa,2019-08-25 09:09:34,NTA,2404,WIBTA,"The narrator, who is adopted, met their biological mother at 16 and later learned of their sister’s birth but was unable to raise her.

We’ve gotten long sob story texts about how much his shirts would have meant when they were kids, and we were being selfish because he was their family not ours.

And it kills me to say it but he's never had an actual friend other than his younger sister. We've tried so hard to facilitate friendships but it's never clicked.

We were heartbroken to find out that our son was aware of the videos and was allowing his ""friend"" to make fun of him just so they could hang out. 

Despite his protests, I brought up the videos with the boy's parents. I was furious. To their credit, they were extremely apologetic and the mother was so upset she cried.

The boy was very embarassed and was made to apologize to my son. But he's now refusing to become friends with my son again, which has devastated him.

Unfortunately after just a few weeks my wife and sister got into some heated arguments. My sister said some awful, hurtful things to my wife, and my wife said some awful things to my sister. They almost got into a fist fight, but were separated quickly. 

Anyway my sister moved out of our house, but ever since that day, my sis and wife have not seen or talked to each other. Their relationship is so bad I don't speak with my sister on the phone when my wife is around, because my wife starts crying. I usually talk or text my sister during breaks at work or when I am out alone. All of my family took my sisters side, and no longer speak to my wife. 

My sister is getting married soon, and invited me, but  told me she did not want my wife to be there.  My parents who live 800 miles away, and who I don't see often, are coming to the wedding and need someone to take them to the ceremony and reception. I offered to take them and am planning on going to my sisters wedding just for like 3 hours or so.

7513,Everyone Sucks,"I am taking a few courses at my college this summer, to help lighten the load come fall. This one professor had a decent review on [RateMyProfessor.com](https://RateMyProfessor.com), but one thing a lot of students definitely said was that he’s a hard ass about his cellphone/distractions policy. Now, I don’t care about that. Summer sessions are shorter, so you need to focus more and sped a lot more time in class, learning the material.

The thing is, this professor, if he seems someone on their cellphone or suspects they’re using their laptop for anything other than notes, will stop the lecture to go over and yell at them. This happens multiple times, throughout the class. It gets annoying, disrupts class and basically ruins whatever we’re doing. I get it’s disrespectful and that it’s on these students too, but if he just ignored it (especially as they’re doing it silently-no music or anything, I don’t even know they’re doing it until the professor is yelling-and it’s not bothering us), we could move along.

Today, he did it quite a few times within the first half hour of class. I got so frustrated with him, because we barely got through the first bit of the lecture and I felt like I was back in high school, not a university classroom. I let out an audible grumble and the professor gave me a look. I asked “Can we just go on with class?” He said, “When this student puts their phone away.” I said “You stopping class every time someone takes their phone out, takes away from us learning. It’s more annoying than a cellphone, to be honest.” He started on the syllabus and I just said I didn’t want to argue, I just wanted to learn.

After class, we all got an e-mail about the policies again and if we “had any issues with how he ran his classroom, to please see him after class”.

I don’t know if I made things better or worse. The class is over next week, thank God, I just had to say something because I feel like I learned so little in this class. (Btw, I have never been yelled at by him before this entire session, so I’m not being bitter about it or anything. I’m just being annoyed about having to stop class.)

21441,Asshole,"(Sorry for bad English, it's not my native language).

My (43F) son (17M) met his girlfriend (17F) a year ago. I was very happy to see that he had found someone. The girl seemed sweet but clearly had a lot of teenage angst. Very ""punk-rock"" with colored hair and a hardcore vegan. I've heard her say inflammatory things about groups she opposes such as wealthy people, white people (she's white herself), etc. I felt like she wasn't the best influence for my son but I was glad that she wasn't involved in drugs or alcohol like a lot of girls his age.

Around the time for Christmas my son and his girlfriend were in his room talking. I could tell that they didn't know that I had come home considering that they were talking about some less PG stuff. I wanted to respect their privacy so I went into a room where I wouldn't be able to hear them that well. Then I heard this loud laughter erupting from the girl and she started talking more loudly. Then I could hear her talking trash.. about me. She talked about how I was the ""whitest fucking person"" she has known and laughing about my conservative values. The last straw for me was when she said I was a ""gold digger"" who wants a rich man (my husband is quite wealthy but not crazy rich) to ""fund her boob jobs"". This hit a sore spot for me considering that my husband DID pay for my breast implants. It's not my proudest moment and I have no idea how she would be aware of that considering that I never told my son anything about it. It was tough to hear but I managed to compose myself. I didn't say anything to my son because he would get angry that I had been ""eavesdropping"" (which is not true, she was just talking very loud)

The day after I went into the grocery store (this was before quarantine) and saw a bunch of wonderbread in the bread aisle, which made me remember that my son's girlfriend said that I ""was so white that I would probably think white bread is spicy"". Christmas was coming up so I bought circa 7 wonderbread packages (I know it could be considered a waste  but I have enough money to afford it) to give to my son's girlfriend. She was going to visit us the day before Christmas so I thought it was a good early 'christmas present' to give her.

The day arrives and I give the girlfriend her 'present'. She just laughed in a smug manner which was even more infuriating. Later they went to their room and I just went outside because I didn't want to listen to all the hurtful things she had to say.

After that day it wasn't really anything that got brought up until I was in an argument with my husband a day ago and he said that he couldn't believe how mean I was to this young girl. I was mad that he dropped that bomb on me without talking about it before. It really hurt hearing the most important person in my life say that.

3398,Asshole,"Hello, first time poster and my grammar is terrible.

Now then, this was about a year ago; I was a college sophomore with a freshman roommate. We got along, okay. We didn't hate each other but we were barely friends as we had different interests. Anyway I have a refrigerator/microwave  set in our dorm room. It doesn't come with the dorm room so it's mine technically but I barely use it, so I told my roommate he could use it.

&#x200B;

Anyway onto the story; me and my roommate (who I shall refer to C) are just relaxing, I'm relaxing on my bed playing a phone game while he's doing something else. I see him get up and get a cup of macaroni to microwave.  Now due to being a little bit of a neat freak, and annoyed when people don't cover their food I told him if he microwaves anything with an exposed top to cover it, since I don't want to be cleaning out dried up food stains month later. As he puts in his little cup I can see the macaroni, uncovered, and no napkin or anything in sight.

Me: Hey do you mind covering that up? I don't want it to splatter.

C: It's fine, there's a line inside so it doesn't spill over.

I reach over and hold onto the microwave door so he can't close it(the whole set was right next to my bed and in arms reach)

Me: Even if that's the case, I'd really appreciate if you'd cover up your food man.

C: I said it's fine. 

He tries to press the door close but I' able to keep it open with one hand. I turn to face him as he starts to raise his voice.

C: Could you please move your hand?"" He asks, while also trying to pry my fingers off.

Me: Could you please cover your food? A simple napkin will suffice, I'm not asking you to get the holy grail.

C: Move your hand, NOW."" At this point I'm using both hands as he equally tries to force the door close and pry my fingers off.

Me: Only when you cover your food, I'm not asking much, cover your food or you can use the public microwave."" I say, sitting up and raising my voice as well. After a minute of me stopping him he pulls the door open and takes out his food. He then walks over to his side of the room and THROWS his uncooked food into the trash with a loud BANG. Tiny pieces of hardened macaroni fly all over the room as I fully sit up. 

Me: Jesus man are you seriously going to throw a temper tantrum?"" I ask as he just goes to his bed gibing me the silent treatment. ""I say 'cover your food' and you wanna loose it, are you even going to clean up all the macaroni you scattered?"" Again silence as I sigh, and brush all the macaroni bits to his side of the room.

9320,Everyone Sucks,"Hello all...

I inherited my grandmother's engagement ring. It's a rather plain ring with about a quarter carat center stone and two smaller stones, one on each side. I have two sons that I had offered the ring to, so they could propose to their future bride. My oldest declined and bought the ring he gave to my now daughter-in-law. My youngest declined when he married the mother of my granddaughter, who is a wonderful person and I lover her to pieces. After divorcing wife #1, he asked for the ring for wife #2. I have met #2, but I am not sure she is the right fit for my son. I reluctantly gave him the ring about 6 months ago. They got married the weekend before the Fourth, but never bothered to call me and tell me, either before or after the wedding.

I have been stewing over this for the past week. I have never been one to be angry at my children. At least not like I am right now. To give you some background, #2 is calling the shots in their relationship. She is doing exactly what their father's second wife did to me. My son does not call or text me. I received some very strongly worded text messages from ""him"" over Mother's Day, which ruined my day. (I found out from #1, #2 likes to take over his phone pretending she is him. #2 asked me to not have any contact with #1 because I should embrace his new family now.) He has not communicated with me in any meaningful way since hooking up with #2. She has taken control of his FB account, and has unfriended me for both my son and herself. Probably because she doesn't care for my political and religious stances. (She voted for the current occupant of the WH. Enough said.) Now they get married and never bother to tell me.

As a result of the actions above, I want to demand my grandmother's ring back. The ring means the world to me and represents family, love and devotion. (FYI, his dad and I were married on what would have been my grandparent's 50th wedding aaniversary.)  This woman who now wears this ring, does not imbue any of those qualities.

A bit of backstory, she isn't fat by any means, her fiancé is a little chubby but id say he's more stocky than actually chubby.  I am a bit stocky too from what people have told me.

280,Asshole,"Hello all. Throwaway b/c I’d rather not have this associated with my main. I have family that lurks on here. 

I (30F) am pregnant with my first child, and it’s a girl!!!!💗💗🎀🎀🎀 I’m so excited to meet her. She’s definitely a bright spot in our lives right now. I also have a large, traditional, very Irish-Catholic family. There’s a lot of reusing names—i.e. one cousin is “Rose Elizabeth” while another is “Elizabeth Rose.” So far, it’s worked without too many snafus and a lot of compromise. 

Here’s where there might be an issue. My uncle and I have a mutual interest in family genealogy, and we’ve been trying to create a family tree via old letters/documents. As I was going through it, I found what I consider to be the perfect name—for these purposes, I’ll say that it’s “Mabel Josephine”, nn Mae. My husband loves it too, and it’s the first name that we’ve agreed on since we found out she was a girl. 

My sister (34F), however, is named Mae Janice. She has a daughter named Mei with her ex-husband as well. When I told her what our plans were, she kind of made a face and said that I needed to choose another nickname. Her reasoning is that there are way too many Mae/Meis in our family already, and that it’s gotten confusing and frustrating. She asked if we would mind using the full name but calling her something else—i.e. ‘Bella.’ I got really mad, and I admit that I said some regrettable things about her family and husband.

19997,Not the A-hole,"This is a Throwaway account because I don’t know if any of my family members have Reddit. Also I’m on mobile so sorry for the formatting.

So my (18f) grandparents (my dads parents) ring me every week. Almost every time they ring me my cousin (21f) is brought up. I used to get on really well with her but after my parents divorced when I was 7, she sent a really mean message to my mum which basically said that my mum was a bad parent and that she shouldn’t have custody of me (a complete lie because my dad had already practically abandoned my brother and had done the same thing to me through the divorce). Since then I have not liked her but remained civil around her as I didn’t want to cause anything. It is also quite clear to other family members that this cousin is the favourite grandchild. 

Anyway, every time I shared my achievements with my grandparents, they overshadowed them by talking about everything my cousins was doing in her university dance course. On of the times this happened was when I told them that I would be performing in a show with two professional dancers from their favourite tv show. There was no congratulations or asks of when it was. Instead they said that cousin previously had the same opportunity but broke her ankle so she couldn’t take part. If they had said congratulations or shown any acknowledgment then I wouldn’t be so bitter about it but it seemed as if they  gave me no recognition. It has reached that point where the phone conversations with me are more about her than what I’ve been up to. 

There are also other smaller things that they do as well such as always ringing me whilst I’m at work (I was a tutor before Lockdown and now I tutor via video call). I work the same hours every week and would tell them every week that I wouldn’t be able to answer the phone during that time. Yet they still kept ringing me during my shifts. I wouldn’t be so annoyed if I didn’t find out that they would always make sure they didn’t ring my cousin during her lessons or rehearsal times at uni which changed every week!

So my school made this dumb rule that nobody can have a water or drink bottle with them because a couple seniors got caught drinking vodka at school.

The only exception is if you have a form signed by your doctor saying there's a medical reason you need it. And carry the note with you whenever you have a water bottle so you can show it to teachers or administration.

Now, my doctor who i have my yearly checkup with is also one of my mom's best friends, and last week she and her daughter were coming around to hang out with our family.

I was telling her and my mom about the school rule and they thought it was silly too. My doctor was talking about how unhealthy it was to not let kids drink water all day, and sell them sugary sodas at lunch 

I asked if she'd sign a doctor's note allowing me a water bottle and she said od course. So I printed out the form and she signed it. There was a section saying to describe the medical need and she wrote ""water is necessary for life"" which my  mom thought was funny but also thought might get the note rejected, like it was obviously meant for specific medical conditions or disabilities. 

But she said that if anyone had a problem with it, to have them call her and they'd get a piece of her mind.

So I took the note to school and a bunch of teachers told me I couldn't have a water bottle and I said I had a note. Most of them didn't read it closely enough to see the reson but out of the two that did, one laughed about it and asked if it was real. I said it was, she could call the number on the form. She seemed satisfied.

The other teacher threatened to take the note away, saying medical exemptions were not a joke, it was a disrespectful thing to do, disrespectful to the school's rules and disrespectful to people who had an actual medical need, to treat it as a joke.

I know my doctor hadn't meant it as a joke about actual medical problems...

6003,No A-holes here,"I've seen a lot of narc mom validation posts on here...and I hope this isn't one.

I had my twins when I was 17. I dropped out of school and moved in with a friend who was helping me support them-no rent. I got a job, earned my GED, and over the next few years I started college and got another job to pay for it. For most of their early childhood, I worked two or three jobs and took classes at a community college. Some bad events took place at my friend's house and I was forced to move into an apartment. Good news? A classmate with a boy my girls' age was looking for a place, so we became roommates and kinda co-parents. Worked great, we lived together until I was almost out of uni.

Still working two jobs, I usually had night and early morning shifts and she had day shifts. Someone was always with the kids, and when she started working more we got a babysitter. At this point we were still very poor-we wore bras and underwear with holes in them because we didn't have money for new ones. She got engaged, moved in with the guy, and I was forced to find a cheaper apartment I could make on my own. I graduated, got work as a bookkeeper in a legal office, and started earning enough to confidently stay afloat and afford a reliable babysitter. We stayed in the apartment until my kids had moved out and I saved enough to move to a house in a small town (years later).

Now, my girls are posting mean spirited comments on FB and complementing each other. One will post something about 'I didn't know how poor I was until I realized how big a yard can be' and the other one will say 'I always knew, other kids with competent mothers had huge backyards and we had an apartment'. Complaining about yards, being 'raised by babysitters', always moving...I got sick of it. I replied on one of their posts saying they always had a safe home with food and at least one adult around to protect them which is more than other children and they shouldn't be whining like this when they were competently cared for. My daughter deleted it, and some friends have pointed out that growing up poor still isn't easy and they were likely bullied and felt some uncertainty for the future. I've been told a good mother would let them vent now so they can come to terms with their past. While I see the reason, I also feel calling me incompetent as a mother is mean and uncalled for.

Edit: I should have put this in long before now, but the ""bad events"" at my friend's place had nothing to do with my kids. My friend's parents had serious health and financial problems and could no longer house me for free. The rent they needed to supplement lost income was too high, so I had to leave so they could rent to someone else.

Also, thanks to everyone who left advice. I was expecting a lot of YTA, but I was surprised by the direction they're taking. It's opening my eyes to this, and I know I have to actually talk to my children about this. I'll try and handle it better than I have so far.

21511,Not the A-hole,"EDIT: Ahaha the grammar of my title is atrocious, I changed my mind about the title but didn't change the grammar and now can't change it. My bad LOL

Thought I would post this as dreaded Thursday approaches (the day of the week when my mum rings me constantly to tell me what an awful daughter I am and accuse me of favoritism). I honestly do not think I am the AH but let's see what all of you think.

My in-laws are allowed to babysit my kids, my parents are not. My parents have constantly broken boundaries and you cannot even talk to them about it. They will scream, give you the silent treatment and all in all just ignore you and do whatever you want. My in-laws however have always show care and listen to what we say. My in-laws also have a child with special needs (my boys have special needs) and so are experienced with this. My parents 'parenting' comes down to threats and screaming in your face.

My parents were allowed to babysit for a little bit when my oldest was born ( I thought they had changed) however it quickly became apparent that they had not.

Notable incidents:

\- Complaining when my brother gave ventolin to his toddler after he got out of hospital (with oxygen troubles). They claimed he was drugging him with ventolin? My youngest son has severe asthma

\- They watched my 2 week old. I told them specifically that this bottle was old and only good for maybe 5 minutes, there was a new bottle in the bag. I come back hours later and he is feeding baby old bottle. I exclaim that's the old bottle and my dad rolls his eyes and walks away shaking his head preventing me from getting baby back.

This is just one of MANY incidents. I don't trust them. My mum says its completely unfair that they can't babysit while my in-laws can. She wants me to ring the in-laws (with her on the line) and tell them that they can't babysit ever again. My in-laws don't babysit out of necessity, occasionally they just ask for one or both boys to spend the night for fun. I absolutely do not want to punish my loving in-laws because my parents are crappy people with jealousy issues but is it fair that one set of grandparents is allowed more freedom than the other? My mum is constantly crying about how unfair this is.

So I've known my wife for 9 years, we dated for 5, and we've been married for just under 6 months.  She comes from an insanely toxic family, she was emancipated at 16 and to this day refuses to speak to any of her family. They are all addicted to meth and her sister to meth + anything she can get her hands on. Her sister has 3 kids, ages 9 months (F), 6 years (M), and 13 years (F). My wife began taking care of these children when the first was born when she was only 7 years old because no one else would. For whatever reason CPS never took the kids away despite near constant monitoring and the last my wife knew of these kids was 3 years ago when she permanently cut her family off. 

&#x200B;

Her parents always assumed she would adopt any children her sister produced (this actually was the beginning of the rift that led to her cutting her parents off) and were never shy about it. When we started dating (She was 15, I was 17) I told her that if she adopted those kids then the relationship wouldn't work out because if I am having kids they are going to need to be my own **(EDIT: My mind was going at a million miles per hour when I typed this. This is not an all-encompassing statement. When I typed it I was focused on my current situation. I would not be opposed to marrying someone with kids already, I just expected to never raise these children and I do not want to.)** . She agreed and said she had no desire to ever adopt those kids. 

  
I just deleted like 5 paragraphs worth of useless details because I'm just ranting. I will just get to the point, so out of the blue last week she tells me that she feels guilty about leaving the children behind and she is planning on reaching out to her sister to formally adopt them.  I told her hell no, I made it clear very early on that I do not want to raise those kids. She told me that she assumed I would ""grow out of it"" and accept them. We argued and have been arguing over and over for days now about her decision. She has since reached out to her sister and has started the process of adopting the children. The oldest girl is pregnant, the middle child is a decent kid, and the youngest one only got out of prenatal ICU 5 months ago due to the mother's incessant abuse of drugs during pregnancy.   I am 22, she is 20. I think even if I wanted to adopt these kids I would still want to say no due to our age and financial situation (She works at a make up store, I work at a grocery store for fucks sake)

9658,No A-holes here,"I really need to help on this one because it’s been eating at my conscious.

A few years ago I decided to start sponsoring a child in Haiti, a little girl who is about 6 now. The sponsorship consists of just me paying $38 a month until she either turns 21 or leaves the program.

I was younger and more impulsive when I made this decision and only now as a college student working two jobs realizing that it’s actually more money than I thought, it’s one of my larger monthly expenses.

I took a trip to Haiti a while ago to see the program first hand for myself and I am certain that they are a good organization and that the donations actually help the kids sustain themselves.

I know that $38 doesn’t seem like a lot to many people but for me right now it would be nice to be able to save as much as I can until I get situated in the career I’m pursuing. I want to become a teacher because I am very passionate about helping children which is why this is so difficult!

The older the kids in the program are the LESS likely they are to be sponsored, with teens rarely ever getting sponsored, I want to believe that if I decided to stop sponsoring her right now that she would get a new sponsor fairly quickly.

9320,Everyone Sucks,"Hello all...

I inherited my grandmother's engagement ring. It's a rather plain ring with about a quarter carat center stone and two smaller stones, one on each side. I have two sons that I had offered the ring to, so they could propose to their future bride. My oldest declined and bought the ring he gave to my now daughter-in-law. My youngest declined when he married the mother of my granddaughter, who is a wonderful person and I lover her to pieces. After divorcing wife #1, he asked for the ring for wife #2. I have met #2, but I am not sure she is the right fit for my son. I reluctantly gave him the ring about 6 months ago. They got married the weekend before the Fourth, but never bothered to call me and tell me, either before or after the wedding.

I have been stewing over this for the past week. I have never been one to be angry at my children. At least not like I am right now. To give you some background, #2 is calling the shots in their relationship. She is doing exactly what their father's second wife did to me. My son does not call or text me. I received some very strongly worded text messages from ""him"" over Mother's Day, which ruined my day. (I found out from #1, #2 likes to take over his phone pretending she is him. #2 asked me to not have any contact with #1 because I should embrace his new family now.) He has not communicated with me in any meaningful way since hooking up with #2. She has taken control of his FB account, and has unfriended me for both my son and herself. Probably because she doesn't care for my political and religious stances. (She voted for the current occupant of the WH. Enough said.) Now they get married and never bother to tell me.

As a result of the actions above, I want to demand my grandmother's ring back. The ring means the world to me and represents family, love and devotion. (FYI, his dad and I were married on what would have been my grandparent's 50th wedding aaniversary.)  This woman who now wears this ring, does not imbue any of those qualities. Excuse me for being crass, but she carries my son's dick and balls in her purse. And I'm not the only one in the family that thinks this way.

17504,not the a-hole,"This happened Saturday night. The people across the street were having a gender reveal party and I assume doing some drinking. Around 8:30 maybe, they started launching off fireworks and because it was so close to our house, they were very loud. Loud enough to wake up my infant son, but I was gonna just let that go. Hey, it's right after the 4th of July and they're celebrating something really exciting. Have your fun.

What angered me was when I looked out the window and saw that they were launching the fireworks right next to my car. Like two feet away. Now their guests had lined the whole block with cars. My car was parked across the street and maybe 10-15 feet sideways from their house, so this was a deliberate choice. Then they started piling the spend fireworks boxes on another neighbor's grass. Mind you, to do so, they had to walk to the street, pick up the garbage, and make the conscious decision to carry that garbage to another property, rather than bringing it back to their own on the way to get the next box to launch off. Needless to say, I was angry.

Here's what I did. I guess it was passive aggressive. I walked to the car between launches and started inspecting it, making sure no debris had fallen on it. One guy, 50s or 60s maybe, says to me, ""Do you want to move the car?"" I replied, rather angrily, ""No, do you want to move the fireworks?"" Then I added rather spitefully, ""You also woke up my infant son."" Then I stormed off back into my house. Immature? Yeah probably. But how could a whole group of adults make the conscious decision to launch large fireworks off right next to a stranger's car, rather than either any of the dozen plus cars that belonged to them, or in the nearby intersection were there were no cars at all?

4345,Everyone Sucks,"Hiya Reddit! I made an account for the sole purpose of asking this so here we go!

I rent an apartment with 3 other people. They’re awesome and I have no qualms living with them except for this one thing.

I have a few guinea pigs in my room that are my beloved pets. They have a super cool custom enclosure that I designed myself. My roomies are cool with the piggies... a little too cool with them, actually!

My roommates had a bad habit of taking my guinea pigs out without permission. Sometimes I would come into my room to find one of my roomies hanging out with the pigs. Which is all fine and dandy, but it kinda bothered me that they didn’t ask me first. They would also take them out when I wasn’t home home or take them out to show guests.

I had no problem with my roommates wanting to interact with my pigs, but I wanted them to ask me first. I told them this and they didn’t really listen, and continued to play with my piggies without asking me. I asked them several more times to please not take the pigs out without asking or letting me know, especially when I wasn’t home. Didn’t work.

I decided to put my foot down. I now have a lock on my bedroom door and don’t let my roomies interact with my guinea pigs anymore. They started asking me politely if they could see them/started asking permission, but imo too little too late. I have effectively banned my roommates from seeing the guinea pigs.

My roommates are pissed and this has caused a huge rift between us. They are arguing that they “share” their pets (which is true — I frequently hang out with the cats in the household), and that they have a bond with my guinea pigs. They say it is unfair of me to ban them since 1) they now love the piggies and 2) they don’t ban me from playing with their pets.

I understand that my piggies are lovable but I had to put my foot down! I gave them the chance to just ask me and they didn’t respect that. 

My friend group has been calling me a jerk, saying I’m being rude and creating unnecessary drama, and they are siding with my roommates.

In retaliation, I am now banned from interacting with the cats in the house which sucks but whatever. 

My roomies and friends say I’m a grade A asshole and should lift the pig ban so that the house isn’t a tense dramafest but I’m not budging. It’s created such a horrible atmosphere in the apartment that being home sucks.

409,Not the A-hole,"I’m a stay-at-home mom with four kids, ages 3-9. Husband has been working from home for the past few weeks. We didn’t have a home office set up before this. He could have chosen the guest room at the back of our house for his work space, as there’s a desk in there. But he said it was too small for him, so he set up in the dining room. He tried to block off an area with room dividers, but it’s not the same as having actual walls. Also, the dining room is (obviously) right next to the kitchen, but also next to our designated playroom for the kids. 

His job is fairly flexible, but we try to stay out of his way while he’s working, especially when he has conference calls. I’ve taken the kids to the back room at times when he’s asked for quiet, or we’ve gone for walks. 

On this particular day, his call was close to lunchtime and I was making food in the kitchen, while the kids were in the playroom, where I can see them from the kitchen. I did have to keep reminding them to keep their voices and playing quieter, but I actually thought they were doing a good job. 

When the call was over, husband came out of his “office” and said, “well, that was the worst meeting I’ve had. They couldn’t be quiet for one hour. That’s all I asked for: one hour.” I couldn’t even respond. I felt like it was all my fault and I was a terrible person for not taking the kids out of the house for that hour. This feeling was made worse by the fact that there was nowhere to escape in the moment. We’re all stuck at home together. 

I have friends who’ve made work-from-home spaces in garages so that they’re away from the noise of their kids. I understand that it’s stressful to change his work environment and that the kids are distracting, but my job has also changed a lot, with no school or activities or friend visits to distract the kids.

17075,Asshole,"Me (25 M) and my family live in a fairly small town. It‘s one of those places where everyone knows everyone and word always spreads fast. Of course that can be annoying sometimes, but oh well.
Two years ago my little brother (16 M) came out as gay. Everyone in our family immediately accepted him, but of course that didn’t stop other people from gossiping and talking shit.

I‘ve always been very close to my little brother. He used to get bullied in school for being „too feminine“ (it‘s better now, but some guys are still rude to him), so I always saw it as my responsibility to look out for him and keep him safe from those assholes. After coming out to us and his friends, his self-esteem has improved a lot  though and I‘m super proud of him!

One thing my brother loves is make-up. From what I can see he‘s pretty good with it too (we always joke about him becoming a Youtube MUA after he graduates) and even though I don’t know too much about this kinda stuff, it makes me happy that he‘s found a hobby.

A few weeks ago, my brother was hanging out with friends and left the house with full make-up on (brows, eyeshadow, eyeliner, etc.). When he got back, he told me some guys he ran into were really rude to him and called him names. He was scared they would get violent so he just ran away. I comforted him and added that it might be a good idea to stop wearing make-up in public and just do it at home for now. He was pretty upset by that and accused me of victim blaming and trying to stop him from expressing himself. Before I could even say anything he left the room and now refuses to speak to me.

I feel like my brother twisted my words here. He can do whatever he wants as long as he‘s happy and not inconveniencing someone else. The reason why I suggested it is because I‘m scared something might happen to him. I don’t want him to get assaulted or insulted by close-minded people when he‘s outside and I‘m not there to protect him.
On the other hand, maybe I went about it the wrong way and shouldn’t have said something like that at all, idk.

9012,Not the A-hole,"It's my birthday in August and I'm having a BIG party. I've invited old friends from all across the country (and even some outside of the country). I've put months into organizing this and believe me - it's gonna be a HUGE thing. Think a meadow, open bar, huge cannopy, street food trucks etc. My bf joked the party is almost like a wedding where I'm marrying myself. My only excuse is that I've never celebrated my birthday before and I'm going all out. I've also worked as a wedding planner before and know some people, so I get a few discounts ;)

Anyway: my goddaughter is usually a lovely girl. She's the daughter of a friend I've known since birth ( who is also coming to the party) and we've been very close over the years. She graduated from university a few years back and moved pretty far away for work but we've stayed in contact as best as we could.

I have always supported her, both emotionally and  financially. A few years ago we made the deal that we would try to meet up once every three to four months - sometimes we'd go explore a new city, sometimes we'd go to a spa, things like that.

Well, a year ago my goddaughter started skipping out on me. She was still asking me for money every now and then and I gladly gave it to her but I was really hoping to spend some time with her to catch up. Hopes she dashed time and time again my cancelling on me (sometimes last minute). I did my best trying to compromise, offered to drive to her city to just have a nice day in town or to even just go for lunch (which I was willing to drive almost eight hours for btw): she declined. Twice she cancelled on me just for me to find out through SM that she was ""spontaneously"" going on trips with friends. The hurtful thing about this is that we would always find dates for our meetings months in advance and if she couldn't make it, I had no problem with rescheduling. She never did that, she just cancelled.

Over the months I tried to rationalize that she was a young woman just getting started with her life and maybe just wanted to spend her time differently - but she never talked to me or her mum about it, just kept taking my money and pretended to be excited to see me, only to then cancel on me.

Last weekend was the last straw - we planned for her to drive to my town so we could go to a concert together, which she had gifted me as a christmas present last year. She never showed. Instead I heard from her mother that GD had apparently lost her wallet. GD never explained anything to me, never rescheduled.

After considering all this, I decided to shoot her a text and uninvited her from my birthday. Guess what? She immediately called me back, acting completely surprised and hurt. I told her my reasoning and she became enraged, telling me I was TA for uninviting me just because life had gotten in the way a few times. Her mother is not currently speaking to me even though she knows the entire story.

18081,no a--holes here,"Hi Reddit

My BF is getting back from a work trip tonight, and he's been away for a while so I figured it would be nice to pick him up from the airport. He missed his original flight which was going to get in at 7:15PM, and had to catch another one getting in 12:30am (ugh). When it came time for him to depart, he told me that the plane was about half an hour late in taking off, so he'd be getting in at one (uuuuugh). I say no biggie. Not ideal, but ok.

I go to check the flight schedule to see what's up, and lo and behold, his flight is actually delayed by more than a full hour, so it looks like he's scheduled to get in at 1:45. He's in the air, and it'll be a couple hours before I head to the airport, but I feel like A) he should know that he's going to be delayed quite a bit longer than originally expected and B) should probably try to contact me about this? He's on a flight that definitely has wifi, so he's more than capable. I sent him a few chagrined messages when I found out asking why he wouldn't try to let me know what the actual delay was, and I feel like I might have been too harsh. At the same time, I'm majorly going out of my way for him and feel like he should at least be making some attempt to keep me in the loop about this.

13053,No A-holes here,"My brother, who I have a very strong bond and good relationship with, has been trying for years to get his wife pregnant, all to no avail. It’s believed that he’s sterile, and this saddens him (and me) very greatly. A while ago, they accepted that he is unlikely to ever have biological children, and began looking for a sperm donor. But just recently, they posed a new, unconventional idea to me - that **I** be the donor.

Asking your brother to donate sperm for you might be an odd or even inappropriate request in most circumstances, but ours is a unique one - we are identical twins. We share 100% identical DNA, and thus any child born of my sperm would be related to my brother **every bit as much** as his own child from his own sperm would. This would not be the case with regular brothers, where the baby would be related as a nephew/niece to him. And because of this, the child wouldn’t find out about the “donation” from one of those home DNA tests so many people are taking now - my brother and I both would show up as the father on any DNA test because of our identical DNA.

My brother views having an identical twin as a great stroke of luck in this situation, and an opportunity to be able to have his own children after all.

8406,Not the A-hole,"I'm getting married in a couple weeks. It's going to be small, only 12 guests, so we're having dinner at a 5 star restaurant rather than having the event catered. I met with the restaurant manager a couple of months ago and explained that I was lactose intolerant. She assured me they could accommodate. A few days ago she emailed me the proposed menu for the 5 course meal everyone would be eating. Every item except one looks like it contains dairy.

&#x200B;

I asked if they'd be using dairy substitutes, and she told me no, they had a ""separate menu"" planned for me. I don't want to be an asshole or a bridezilla, but I am honestly baffled and annoyed. If they have to plan a separate menu anyway, why not just make the entire thing without dairy? Is it really easier to do two separate 5 course meals?

&#x200B;

For some context, I am not dairy free by choice, and I was not born this way. I developed the intolerance about 4 years ago. I am a foodie and I LOVE cheese, creamy sauces, ice cream, all things dairy.  The ""actual"" menu the restaurant manager sent me looks amazingly delicious, and I don't want to be staring enviously at what everyone else is eating. If it weren't my own wedding, I'd suck it up and be grateful someone accommodated my issue. However, this is going to be an expensive dinner and it's my own freakin' wedding! My fiancé is very supportive and has given up dairy with me except for the occasional pizza. Would I be a selfish bridezilla if I asked the restaurant to serve everyone this ""separate menu,"" whatever it is?

&#x200B;

Would I be an asshole for not letting my guests enjoy the dinner the restaurant has planned for them? Thank you for any feedback! I have not yet decided whether to make an issue out of this or just let it go.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I agree that I WBTA if I were restricting everyone from ordering what they wanted off the restaurant's normal menu. This is going to be a pre-set 5 course dinner. Salad, App., Entree, 2 desserts. Everyone has the same thing (but could opt out of one or two if they didn't like it). It's not going to be a normal catered wedding where you have 3 or 4 options.

2512,Not the A-hole,"Hey,  


I'm in an advanced stage for going on an exchange to a top tier university in the United States (I'm from Europe). But I didn't tell my girlfriend about it, and I feel bad. But I understand why I did it, but I want to know If I'm being an asshole.

Me and my girlfriend are together for 1,5 years now and we know each other for 2 years. We've had a lot of ups and downs, but things are going pretty awesome until now.

My girlfriend went on an exchange for 5 months when we were in a 6 months relationship. And things went bad. She couldn't take it that she was so far away from home and missed me too much. She controlled my life for the 5 months she was there. I flew over every 2/3 weeks, and that broke me down.

So when she was back, she told me that she never wanted to do something like that again and that she never wanted to be so far away from me for that long. I understand because it was one of the worst experiences for me too. Not because she was so far away for so long, but due to the simple fact, that I didn't have a life for 5 months because of it.

Fast forward 8 months later: I had a conversation with one of my study advisors and she told me that because of my GPA and my background (I'm from a poor family), I was eligible for a scholarship and funding to go on an exchange to the University I mentioned above. I was so freaking happy because it was always a dream of mine to go on an exchange to the United States, but I never thought it would be possible because I had no money.

So I'm going to my girlfriends' place and told her that I""m eligible for an exchange to the US and that I was so happy that a dream of mine is going to be reality. She totally freaked out, she cried and literally had some type of panic attack. She told me that if I'm going to the United States, our relationship is over. And that I am a selfish jerk who thinks just about his own happiness, and that I am ruining the relationship because of that. She begged me not to go, and I told her that I won't.

A week later, a friend of mine told me that there was a meeting for the exchange and told me that I had go. I went to the meeting, and my reaction was that I have to do it. If I won't, I will regret it for the rest of my life.

So I wrote a letter, made an appointment with the advisor, and he told me that the funding shouldn't be an issue. I had an appointment two days ago and the advisor told me, that I won't have to worry and that my application will go through.

But I want to know if I'm the Asshole in this situation? She is telling me that I'm selfish and going to ruin the relationship and that it is my fault. I don't think that I am, because I don't think that any SO, should stand in the way of the partner's dream or personal growth.

So yeah, AITA?",55,138,0.92,AITA for not telling my girlfriend that I applied for an exchange to the other side of the world,dgck8o,2019-10-11 09:19:43,NTA,2782,AITA,"The writer is excited about the opportunity to go on an exchange program to a prestigious university in the U.S., a dream they thought was unattainable due to financial constraints.

After she learns about the opportunity, she reacts strongly, claiming it would end their relationship and labeling him as selfish, leading the writer to question if they are in the wrong for pursuing their personal growth despite the potential impact on their relationship."
13214,Everyone Sucks,"I am a 24 year old autistic woman. I was talking/joking about my sensory issues and how lots of noise or action sets me off and gives me panic attacks. Basiclly I was saying that I wish people would be less noisy in public (I live in a college town so there are always lots of excitable people carrying on everywhere). I specifically was talking about how the last time I went out to eat I had to leave because there was a bunch of drunk guys from my school hooting and hollering and a kid screaming it's head off and the noise made me panicked. I get that that's my problem but who does not bitch and moan to their friends sometimes?

A girl in my common room took this as a personal attack on her and aggressively snapped at me that she is an autism mom and her kid has outbursts and I 'need to deal with it and get over it' because 'you're an adult and they are a child so it's worst for them' and 'I have higher expectations for adults than kids. You should have higher expectation for yourself'.

I have a temper. I've always had a temper. Instantly the implication that you can walk autism off with age pissed me off. Her not being a part of the conversation but busting in pissed me off. Her being so aggressive pissed me off. Her talking over me (a problem a lot of autistic people have with self proclaimed 'autism moms') pissed me off. And lastly the pure condescension in her voice when she implied I am not meeting her expectations pissed me off. So I opened my mouth to tell her to f#ck off but the anger took over and what came out was 'Sit down you annoying f#cking b#tch I can't stand you people'. She then offered to 'beat my ass' and our friends separated us. This isn't the first issue we have had. Last year me and the same girl got into it because she was listening to music with no head phones in during study hall.

13742,Not the A-hole,"This happened a few years ago, but I still think about it.

I used to teach 8th grade.  I had one kid, call him Billy.  He was incredibly smart.  But he also just was a pain in the ass to be his teacher.  The kind of kid that people who never even taught him knew his reputation and who he was.   He wasn't a ""bad"" kid, but he definitely was a smart ass who purposely broke the rules whenever he wanted.   It was all for attention, because honestly, if he just came to my room to hang out before or after school, he was actually nice.

We had this ""behavior contract"" students and their parents had to sign at the beginning of the year.  Essentially after a certain number of detentions or suspensions, we started taking away 8th grade activities.   So the first thing was the DC trip, then it was the 8th grade awards luncheon, and finally it was graduation.  I had never had a kid actually get to the point where graduation was off the table, until Billy.  And this wasn't just detentions I gave, it was anyone.  So while I was his homeroom teacher, he had plenty of other teachers he interacted with, and their punishments counted as well.  He knew early on he wasn't going to DC.  And not long after that, he lost the awards luncheon.  However, he knew he was getting close to not being able to walk for graduation.  And he was fairly good for a while.  But it didn't last.  As it turned out, the detention I gave him, was the one to put him over the edge.   Since it never happened before, the principal actually gave me the final call on whether to take away this privilege (I was very upset as I think it should have been his call and he shouldn't have put it on me).  A lot of people I talked to, including my mom, said how graduation is really for the family, and taking that away would suck for them.  In the end though, I said no, he was difficult all year to all of his teacher, so he will suffer the consequences.  And I didn't let him walk.  I'm still not sure whether this was the right call

&#x200B;

13346,No A-holes here,"Last year a new teacher came to my school. We'll call him Mr. R.

I didn't have Mr. R for any classes, but I liked hanging out in his room, and I'd sit in there and bug him during frees. We had, I guess, a cordial relationship, wherein I would come in and sit in dead silence until the period ended, and sometimes he would sit at the table with me and play country music.

I Googled him one day, as I am prone to doing. I've done this with all of my other teachers (so do all my peers; teachers of Reddit, take note) and generally have found nothing of interest. This was not one of those times.

I looked him up on Youtube and found his channel from when he was, like, 15 years old, and it was full of videos of him, clearly being 15 years old. Nothing incriminating, but definitely cringey, and something I wouldn't want public.

*And then I sent it to my friends.*

This was a dick move, and I instantly felt guilty. I still feel very guilty for that matter. Eventually, after several weeks, I told Mr. R that his Youtube account was public, and he told me it was fine, but made it private a few weeks later. I did not talk to him about it anymore.

Anyways, all that is just for context.

Some time passed. A girl in my grade told me that Mr. R has a music career and told me to look him up. I did, and I found his music, and listened to it, and liked it. Then I downloaded all that I could find for easier listening, and then I stopped looking it up, except for maybe like, refreshing his FB every few months to see if he'd uploaded anything new.

This was all last year.

About a month ago, I cracked under the stress of feeling like I was sneaking around behind Mr. R's back, and I asked him for the tabs to one of the songs. He told me a very strong no. Several days later, Mr. R pulled me aside and told me to not look him up anymore.

It's been a few weeks since then, and I still feel terrible about this, and I'm fairly confident Mr. R didn't like me too much in the first place, but he *definitely* doesn't like me now. I want to go and apologize to him for being creepy, but I also don't want to remind him of my transgressions. Was I being exceptionally creepy? Is he being overly sensitive? Am I overthinking all of this?

Before anyone asks, I'm seventeen, and I'm 99% sure he's 25.

9194,Not the A-hole,"My husband I are expecting our first baby, a daughter. This is probably our only chance to have a biological child and we've had a long time to discuss how we want to do everything. My husband and I are comfortable, financially, but we're not rich or anything. But we live nicely. Our baby will never lack for anything. But we decided to avoid buying crazy amounts of baby clothes. Neither of us are fancy or stylish and we're not a huge fan of the baby clothes we see in stores. I've noticed that a lot of the options for girls still tends to the frilly side, lace and bows and pink and princesses. That's not us, it's not our style. So we decided to keep it simple and bought what we feel will be more useful, onesies and sleepers, t-shirts and those cotton pants, socks and hats. Keeping it very simple.

&#x200B;

Our moms saw the baby's closet and dresser and they asked if they could go out and buy us some cute stuff. I showed them the things we already bought and said as long as whatever they buy is on par with all of that then feel free but anything girly or frilly won't get any use. I've been very clear about this for nine months.

&#x200B;

They went out and bought several huge bags of baby clothes, all of it ugly little lacey, frilly dresses and princess stuff, hats with bows. All the stuff I asked them to avoid. I'll never use any of it. I called them and thanked them but asked if it was possible if they could take them back because we'd never use any of it. I even offered to reimburse them. Both mothers are hurt and say we're trying to deny them a loving relationship with their granddaughter. This isn't the first grandchild so it's not like they'll never get to spoil a grandkid.

&#x200B;

The other issue is the baby shower. I HATE baby showers and every time I've been asked if I want one I've said no. I've never liked baby showers and I don't see the point in them. I've been very clear for nine months that I wouldn't attend one if it was thrown for me. I just learned that they're planning one but they're telling everyone that my husband I are having money troubles and that's why we aren't buying the baby nice clothes. That's a load of hooky.

&#x200B;

I called them both and told them they knew this whole time how I felt about baby showers and that if they insist on throwing one that I won't attend. Now they're both upset and calling me unreasonable, cruel, cold, saying I'm trying to isolate them from the baby. I think as hard as we've worked to see this pregnancy through that I'm entitled to do things how I see fit. There have been some other issues, like their refusal to accept the names we've chosen, or the lack of religion/baptism. It's all come to a head and I'm stressed as fuck. I told them that if they can't respect our wishes then we'd limit their time with our daughter until they could. Everyone we talk to is saying we're awful and cruel. We've been polite, now we're annoyed.

My husband and I have been married for five years. After we had our daughter I got pretty severe postpartum depression. I wasn’t myself for about a year and my marriage slowly fell apart. Everything came to ahead when I found out my husband was having an affair (around 4 months) with another woman. 

We worked through it. We went to counseling, I got help with my depression, and things eventually sorted themselves out and went back to normal. The affair was a little over a year ago. 

One evening a few months ago, I started to think about this woman. I knew her name, so I looked her up on Facebook. I saw that she made art, and looked at her Instagram. Her artwork is beautiful. I found myself checking her Instagram frequently just to look at it. There was one piece that she made around the time of her affair with my husband that really stuck out to me, and I admit I became a bit obsessed with it. 

I eventually messaged her, telling her who I was and the situation, and asked her if it was for sale. She gave it to me. She sent it in the mail, and when it came to me I had it framed. I hung it up in our living room last night. 

When my husband saw it, he immediately recognized it. He got angry, and asked me why I would hang it up. I told him that I loved it, and I couldn’t explain why. I told him about how I had spoken to her, and he got even more upset. He demanded that I the picture down. When I asked him why, he told me I was throwing the affair in his face.

6712,Asshole,"My brother and his partner live overseas, so we rarely get to interact face to face. Every other Christmas is about how often they make the trip here. I gave birth to my daughter three months ago. It was by no means an easy birth, not as tough as some but I was definitely emotionally and physically depleted for the first couple of months. I was (and am still) reeling from having lost my mom two months prior to that. 

Without my mom in my life, I have no close, local family who were equipped to come by and help us at all since the birth. What family members we do have, and our small community of friends, have all made sure to reach out, to wish us well, and to try to help out in ways that made sense from afar. An Uber Eats gift card, a package of diapers from Amazon, that kind of thing.  We also had a nice baby shower that my mom threw for us right before she passed that helped set us up with the things we needed.

My brother texts me occasionally, maybe once every week or two for a brief chat. But he never asks about my daughter, instead it's just casual stuff he is interested in that we have always talked about, like football. I probably asked him to FaceTime with us a dozen times so he could see her in real time, but he always puts it off. He hasn't sent any kind of token or gift for the baby. 

I don't expect him to visit, I know that travel is tough for someone with his job and is expensive, and he was just here for our mom's funeral. But I feel like doing something to mark that he has a new relative, his closest living relative besides myself, would be kind of the normal and appropriate thing to do.

So the other day after getting rejected again for a video chat request I just asked point blank if there was something wrong with him, because it seemed like he didn't care much about the fact that he's an uncle now. He tried to play it off but when I pointed out that he could have at least sent a token gift for his niece he seized on that and made it seem like I was being materialistic. I really don't care if he spends a dime on her, I just want to give him some way to show that he cares more than an Instagram like's worth about my family, about me, about her.

After we split I started going to a nearby bar (maintaining distance from people, etc) to meet and talk with people as I don’t have many friends. I had been going there about a month before my ex started showing up while I was there. This bar is a mile from where I’m living and about 20 miles from her so I’m pretty sure she’s making the trip just to be there when I am (possibly to keep tabs on what I’m doing?)

Well last weekend I asked why she was coming there now and she didn’t have a straight answer so I just tried to ignore her and do my drinking but she wouldn’t leave me alone. I asked her nicely to just do her own thing and I’ll do mine but she wouldn’t leave me alone. 

I was getting sick of her trying to talk to me and sit by me so I asked her if she could please find somewhere else to go so we can both have a good time and not be awkward/upset. The next night she was there again.

I’ve made friends with the bartenders there (ex actually asked one of them if we were seeing each other lol wtf) so another reason I’d tell them would be to protect their jobs but the main reason is honestly that I just want peace.

11209,Asshole,"This is my first post here so I hope I’m doing it right.

My daughter (25F) has been struggling with anorexia, anxiety, and depression for several years now. She’s been through multiple therapists, hospital stays, and treatment facilities. She has a cycle where she’ll go to treatment, do well for a few months afterward, and then relapse, ending up back in treatment. 

Her illnesses have left her behind her peers when it comes to hitting milestones: she hasn’t graduated college yet since she keeps needing to take semesters off for treatment, and when she’s able, she works a part-time minimum wage retail job. She’s still depends on us financially for the most part because she obviously does not earn much at her current job. She’s still on our insurance, but it doesn’t cover much, if anything, when it comes to the care she needs, so my husband and I end up footing the bill for her appointments, treatment stays, etc.

It’s been years of dealing with this, and at this point, my entire family is exhausted. My daughter has expressed guilt for costing us so much money, and every time she swears that this will be her last time going away for help, but a couple months pass and we end up right back where we started. She promises that she’s trying, but I’m starting to doubt that. If she were, obviously something would have clicked or changed by now.

My other children have had to have their lives be put on the back burner because my eldest daughter has taken priority with her issues, and I don’t feel like it’s fair to them. At this point, I wonder if it’s time to step back and just let my daughter figure this out for herself.

WIBTA if I stopped financially supporting my daughter until she proves that she can stay in solid recovery for a significant amount of time? I don’t want my daughter to die, but at this point, I feel like there’s nothing I can do to help her anymore. I’m at the end of my rope.

EDIT: She has a treatment team consisting of a therapist, dietitian, psychiatrist, and primary care physician that she sees weekly/bi-weekly. That just doesn’t seem to be enough for her for long periods of time.

EDIT 2: We’ve looked into getting her on Medicaid, yet none of her providers and practically zero treatment facilities take it, so even if she had it, it wouldn’t be of any use. I did not consider having her apply for disability.

It was one of the first wristwatches ever made and has been a family heirloom, probably worth tens of thousands of dollars. This of course is an important family heirloom which has been passed down to the oldest male of the family. I'll be dammed to be the one to end this chain and ffs it even has my family's surname on it.

My ex girlfriend has been really bitter about the break up blaming me for her cheating saying its my fault she cheated on me because i couldn't support her emotionally and give her attention (i was in a rural village in Armenia teaching kids english for a month). Before that she said tried to deny the  cheating saying some drunk dude at a bar took advantage of her and she thought he was me. Anyways she's a lying shitbag. I was stupid and broke up with her while i was still in Armenia so she dumped all of my shit out of her place and my friend came to pick it up but she kept some of the valuables for herself including the watch. She refuses to give it back saying she needs financial compensation for emotional toll i put on her by being gone for a month and some other bullshit.

Now there are 4 rooms in our house, the Master is used by my parents the middle room was used by my older stepbrother, the smallest room is used by my sister and the final room is used by me and my stepbrother, my stepbrother moved out however to college so I got his room last year which I was happy about since I dislike my stepbrother and we don't get along so sharing a room was horrid, but I was always promised my own room once the oldest stepbrother went to college so I suffered through it.

Now my mom is pregnant and last week they took the smallest room from my sister to make it a baby room, moved my sister in to my room and moved me back in with my stepbrother, as you might imagine I threw a fit but I was told to drop it as such I told my dad I want to move to his house where I have my own room, when my sister heard she immediatly asked my dad as well since we are very close and she doesn't want to live alone with our youngest stepbrother, he said yes and since we're both over 14 we can decide where to live ourselves.

My mom on the other hand is extremely hurt and upset and feels like we're abandoning her over something extremely petty.

5865,Everyone Sucks,"First off, I'm heterosexual, but I am removing gender where possible to normalize/filter sexist or gender biased responses. We'll see how that works out.

First off, I'm very lucky. I know that. My 18 month old child is happy and healthy. While I'm in the process of starting not one but two technology start ups; both my mother and my mother in law have graciously offered to split babysitting for no charge until we enroll our child in daycare.

My partner, while claiming to be appreciative has taken to being quite a drill sergeant (imo) with how child care should be administered by both of the grandma's. There has been a fair share of arguing and contention at various points in the last 12 months over how our child should be fed, put to bed, play, you get the picture... I guess I'm a little bit more lax in that if our child is happy, healthy and fed, I'm generally not going to complain unless there's a risk of some form of danger.

Fast forward to this morning. My partner has a gripe with my mother over what time and how our child is being put to bed. As you can imagine, this is not the first time this is happening, and in the strictest interpretation (regardless of what they might be) my mother has actually been following the 'rules and guidelines' set out. When my mother walked through the door this morning, my partner decided to promptly yell ""hello"" (short and kurt) and within seconds then proceeded to yell and demand from another room about twenty feet away ""This evening when I get home, we (my mother and my partner) need to sit down and discuss (my child)'s sleeping methods and timing"".


Now, in my opinion, even if this grievance needed to be aired, it didn't need to be done in this fashion. Not in the second sentence communicated for the morning, not by yelling from one room to another, not to the person who is graciously taking care of our child for the rest of the day after a one hour commute each way without pay.

In turn, I quickly responded yelling back asking my partner ""When are you going to grow up!?"".

My partner is threatening to take our child and sleep at 'home' (parents house) tonight as a result. I think this is way overblown and my partner was way out of line and needed to be put in (their) place.

733,Not the A-hole,"So my teenage daughter (call her M) has been best friends with her best friend (call her K) for about a year now. They became friends right after K moved here. 

It’s been a year and I’ve barley ever spoken to her parents. She’s often sleeping at our home to the point were I decided to just buy another bed and put it in my daughters room for when she stays. 

I am a very relaxed parent and so is my husband. As long as our kids are doing their best we don’t really set too many boundaries. And because K is basically my fourth child I do the same for her, at least while she’s at my house.

So a few days ago the girls come home and they asked me if K could dye her hair pink in the bathroom. I asked to see her grades and she showed me. She was doing well and I said sure, I didn’t care.

I honestly just assumed she had already asked her actual parents and just wanted to see if it was ok to use the bathroom since M got green dye every where when she did it. I told them to just clean it up after and they said ok.

So fast forward to today when I get a very angry phone call from Ks mother. She demanded to know why I told K she could dye her hair pink. I told her I said it was alright she used my bathroom to dye her hair pink. She went off on me about my parenting choices. She criticized my decision to let MY daughter get piercings, a tattoo, or dye her hair and told me she wasn’t gonna let my bad parenting influence her child anymore. 

I kinda just laughed and reminded her I was basically the one parenting K for the last year. I reminded her I fed her almost every day, paid for her to go on vacation, gave her a roof to sleep under 25 days out of a 30 day month and so much more. This only got her angrier and she claimed that that was all over as well as K and Ms friendship. 

Before I could say anything else she hung up on me. I’ve tried to call her an explain and apologize for the situation escalating but she has blocked me. 

My daughter and K are both distraught and I feel awful for them both. I’m not really sure what to do or if I’m even really in the wrong here. Am I really the ass here?

Edit: some people are saying I haven’t painted a clear enough picture of K and her mother’s relationship. Her mother is neglectful. She never tries to communicate with me or say thank you for anything I’ve done for K. Last time we spoke was in early August. Ks father ignores my husband and I when we try to reach out to him.

18534,Not the A-hole,"A while ago I got new neighbors, a foreign family with a kid of aroud 8 y.o.. Our backyards are separated by a fence, around 2,5m tall, and you can't see the other yard. It gives you quite a load of privacy.

So, every now and then I would find a football in my yard. I just thought ""well, the boy was kicking the ball, and it fell over the fence. Nothing wrong with that because, you know, he is a kid"". So I just would throw it back over the fence.

But at some point it started to happen way too often. I get annoyed, and just decided to not return the balls, and leave it where it is. If he wants, he will have to come over and ask for it. But apparently it was easier for him to just... buy another ball (notice, we are talking about those EUR 5 plastic balls, cheap stuff).  So, one day I wake up and there is not one, nor two, but three balls in my yard. I'm still refusing to return then, unless he comes to ask for it.

Fast forward a few days, and the balls have vanished from my yard. I go and ask my wife if she has returned it, and she says no. So, one day I was in my kitchen, looking torward my garden and what I see? The kid, in my yard, without asking permission. Notice that is a full closed backyard. There is no way in unless someone opes a latched gate, and a 8 y.o. would never reach it, because it is too high. So, the only way he could have come inside my house was if an adult (parents?) opened the gate for him.

At this point I'm starting to get very annoyed, because I see it as a huge privacy invasion. We have hugh glass windows that faces the yard, and having unautorised people there is a huge privacy infrigiment from my point of view. I tried to speak with the parents, that I don't like the fact that the kid was in my yard without my authorisation, but the conversation was unfruitful. They are immigrants in my country, and only speak French, which I can speak, but not to the fluent level. On top of that there is the cultural barrier, and they refuse to acknowledge that an 8 y.o. in my garden characterize privacy invasion.

So, fast forward again to a few days ago, I was cleaning behind my garden house, that by the fence separating our yards, and what I find? A huge stack of toys. The kid was throwing toys on my garden, for god knows why. I think that the toys were accumulating there for a few months already, by their looks.  We are talking plastic cars and trucks, toy tools, that sort of toys.

I didn't want that on my yard, and at that point I had give up on reporting it to the parents (and, by the way, which kind of parent doesn't notice that their child toys are just vanishing?). So, what I do? I pick up all the toys, clean them properly, and donate then to a charity.

So, am I the asshole for doing that? At the end of the day, those weren't my property to donate. But I think that maybe some less fortunate kid will make better use of the toys.

2334,Everyone Sucks,"I suck at technology type things, I'm proud of myself when I put a game system or regular computer together. So since I like gaming & my bf built his own computer he said if I got half the parts he would build it for me for Christmas. 

That was for Christmas of 2018. And it's still not together. At the time I'd said yes but couldn't afford the parts just then so asked him to wait & he guilted me into buying them. Now some are damaged or didn't work from the get go and because it's been so long the Warrenty is over (6month warrenty). 

Since then I found out I was pregnant and had a baby who is 2 months old. Both the father & I work but I take care of the baby all night & all day (we work at the same place, me in an office with the baby and I can come in late & leave early while he does manual labor 9-5), which is fine until the weekend or when we are both home where I would appreciate some help. I also do all the cleaning, take care of my 3 dogs (they get cooked breakfasts and dinner that was frozen then reheated) and take care of my father who is going through colon cancer and chemo.

I’m now a month away from giving birth and today when my husbands ex found out what we were planning on naming baby, she laughed and said “oh we chose that for boy 2!” but ultimately they went with something else. I asked husband later and he confirmed she was right, he just didn’t want to tell me.

I feel like the name is ruined for me now. It doesn’t feel right calling my baby that now knowing that she liked the name and that they had chosen it for one of their sons.

3125,Not the A-hole,"I'm in a group chat for fans of a very popular band (several music awards, millions of followers). It's small because it's made up of long time friends. I joined more recently through my partner who's been a fan for a decade.

One of them, let's call her May, posts in the chat asking to see people's tattoos inspired by or drawn by the band (the lead singer does doodles and puts them online). One of the images is a tattoo on a girl's forearm, clearly drawn by the lead singer. May comes back an hour later with an exact replica of that tattoo, down to the handwriting in it.

A google search shows it was a custom drawing by the lead singer to a fan who was able to contact her and ask for a tattoo design. The lead singer posted the design on Instagram, and outright says in the caption she designed it for a fan.

I wonder if May didn't know this was a custom design, so I asked her in the chat.

May: I know it's a custom piece, I just thought it was gorgeous and had to have it! If I ever find out who the girl is I'll tell her thanks.

Me: you just copied someone else's custom tattoo? 

May: yeah?

At this point one of our friends attempts to change the conversation and I let her. May doesn't.

May: seriously, is there a memo I missed about getting these drawings tattooed haha? What's so bad about this haha?

Me: It's generally considered disrespectful to copy someone else's tattoo. It's considered bad tattoo etiquette to copy a custom design. You can sometimes get away with it if you ask the original tattoo recipient if it's okay to copy it and you have their permission. But you didn't do that, you don't even know who she is, and you stole a piece of artwork that was made specifically for her. She asked the lead singer for a design for her tattoo, and you copied it directly without even considering how she might feel. 

May: wow. Okay. I don't even know what to say. Nobody owns these drawings except the lead singer. We're meant to be a community. I thought this was a safe space where we could celebrate each other and our differences. I thought we were a group of nice people. Guess I was wrong...

May leaves the group chat.

I am immediately criticised because ""it will be on May forever"" and I was too harsh. I apologised for being harsh, but to me all I did was explain why it's considered a bad idea to copy someone's custom design. I explain that I have custom tattoos, and if someone copied them from me, I would be devastated. That doesn't matter to any of them, I ""shouldn't have voiced my opinion"".

It takes a lot of effort to get the attention of the band. That girl must have been overjoyed to get a piece designed for her by her favourite singer, and that really upset me.

I've had to leave the group chat. My partner is also pissed at me.

Many months ago, my gf's parents announced they were divorcing. A few weeks after that, Chuck visited me and made sure I was alone. He asked me for advice on dating since he's only ever been with his wife, and the dating scene has evolved in those two or so decades. I was hesitant at first, but then he said, ""If you don't help, I'll figure this shit out on my own.""

So I was setting him up on some dating apps, but then I remembered a family friend of mine, Molly. Molly's husband died a while back, and I remembered her talking about looking for dates again. I gave Chuck some info on Molly and a pic, he was interested. I called Molly and sent her a pic of Chuck, she was interested. I gave them each other's numbers. They've been together ever since.

That was about 8 or so months ago. The divorce has since been finalized. My gf's sister, Ashley, made an unannounced visit to Chuck's apartment a few days ago and found Molly. Chuck told Ashley how they met and how long. Ashley did the math and realized how soon it was after the divorce announcement. 

Ashley has called me a homewrecker and the grim reaper of her parent's marriage. My gf was predicting a divorce for a while, and said that all I did was expedite the healing process for Chuck.

The result (based on metrics and my work) was that my parents were part of this mass redundancy. I was not allowed to give my parents a heads up. After the news, my parents were/are livid at me.

This meant \*I\* would also be hosting Thanksgiving, as it's a lot of work so I help her out usually by making dessert and most of the side dishes while she handles turkey, gravy and potatoes. I told her what I was planning on making last week, she said sounds good, and we bought most of the ingredients 3 days ago.

Invited to Thanksgiving was my sister and her husband, her husband's mom, my mom's oldest friend/my godfather, and our elderly neighbour. My sister was to bring wine and the other guests were bring appetizers. Also going to be there would be my mom, dad, brother (30M) and I, who all live in one house. 

Last night, my brother asked if there was anything he could do for Thanksgiving. At that point everything was set and my mom and I were definitely worried about a 'too many cooks in the kitchen' situation as my brother is a chef by trade and has a tendency to take over the whole kitchen just to make salad dressing, so my mom said 'I think we'll be okay but thank you for offering. I'll let you know if you can help out in any way tomorrow.' He started to get a bit insistent on making something but my mom and I both said really we had everything planned, and my dad said as it was, he thought there would be way too much food.

Now the problem is, she's recently started a relationship with a mutual friend and until the BBQ had been super in to him. Though she likes to flirt, I've never known her to cheat, until now, she ended up shagging the BBQ guy.

An hour or so later I found her obviously miserable on the sofa, we had a chat about the way she'd treated me, she ended up crying and implying heavily that she only banged him because she was angry with me and he was comforting her. 

She hasn't spoken to me since then and I feel sick at the idea that she was taken advantage of because of my actions and I'm terrified the friendship may be over.

I think the reality of the situation is, as many of you have suggested, that I was blinded by my own poor mental state, leaving me willing to accept the blame for her actions. I can see now that it's pretty clear I'm NTA...
 
We've had a talk/fight and decided to step away from each other for a while. I'm very, very bad at letting go of people, so I suspect not for good. This situation is a poor reflection of who she really is. But then in the past few weeks I've allowed her to walk all over me. That needs to change either way.

8066,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I bought his parents fourth house. They were trying to sell it for years but it never sold. They finally proposed a deal for us to buy it from them. It was a regular mortgage bank deal. We have a 15 year loan and they got their money now and out of the bills/taxes. We did get a discount, but we also had to deal with boxing up their stuff for them and having to clean the entire house (things they would have had to do themselves if it was sold to a stranger). 

Anyway, this was two years ago. All their stuff is gone minus a few boxes in the attic that they'll ""get later."" They live in the next state over, and they come stay with us 4-5 times a year. They still have keys, so they just let themselves in. Sometimes we're home, sometimes we're at work. They sometimes give us a heads up, but we've also come home from work to find them in the living room watching TV. 

I have no problem with them visiting. I actually love it because I get to play hostess and they get to see their grandkid. My problem is with them acting like it's their house and they're allowed in freely. Anytime I tell my husband he says ""it's just while we transition"" or ""they have us a deal, be nice."" We finally got into a fight on Saturday when we came home from garage sales and his parents were home with no notice. They're still here and tension is mounting in my marriage.

18747,Not the A-hole,"I recently finished an internship and undertook training for the first 3 weeks. My trainer (T) was a male, I assume in his 60s, and very condescending. One time, he yelled in my face when I did something wrong, which ended up making me cry, and he then made fun of me for crying to some colleagues. He would sneak into the room when I was concentrating on something, and slap me really hard on the back, then tell me off for being so “on edge”. There are many more stories like this, but I think you get the idea. 

At the end of training, I needed to send feedback, and I had kept notes as the training went on so I had specific examples to refer back to. I made sure in the feedback to keep it professional, and not make it a personal attack on him. I sent in the feedback and his manager (M) replied before I finished work for the day, saying she’d like to meet with T and I the following day. 

After I had finished work that day, I received an email from T. He was absolutely wild about my feedback and called me a lot of names such as “dearie”. The email was very much a personal attack. I showed the email to about 3 people and they all told me it was inappropriate for the workplace and I needed to contact HR. I did, and HR were not at all impressed.

I then had the meeting with M and T. M told me that I should’ve gone straight to her, and left HR out of it. She said the 3 of us could’ve had a chat and smoothed out some issues, but since I had gone to HR this was now on his “permanent record” as a formal complaint. She said it was T’s birthday that day, and Christmas was coming up so it just really wasn’t in the spirit of things to make a complaint. T said that it’s easy for females to get in a temper and write things in a hot-headed state. A lot of back and forth happened, and M eventually finished the meeting by asking ME to apologise to T for causing him this unnecessary emotional stress. I did so (because I was worried for the sake of my job) but I was dumbfounded. 

My manager had a meeting with me after he heard about this. He said I need to accept that older men have a mindset that isn’t going to change, so I just need to deal with it. He said there’s a time and place for the truth, and you need to understand office politics before you involve HR.

This perspective stunned me as all along I thought I had done the right thing by speaking up. I believe I did the right thing by being honest in my feedback, and I don’t regret calling him out for treating me like crap. However, was I right to involve HR? Did I jump the gun by going to HR before the meeting with M and T happened? I was keen to get an unbiased opinion on this, as although it was a few months ago I find myself thinking about it a lot. I don’t want to make this same mistake twice if it was the wrong thing to do, and I don’t want to create a “Karen” reputation for myself in future.

9962,Not the A-hole,"I’ve been with my wife for 6 years now, married for 2. She’s my best friend and we are both very much on the same page and thankfully throughout this whole drama she’s had my back and agrees I’ve done nothing wrong. 

Her sister is younger than both her and I, being in her twenties. My in laws invited us to dinner on Sunday and my mother in law had prepared us a wonderful spread which we took part in finishing up preparing. 

My sister in law decided to make the salad, which she had mixed with her hands and fingers together. Usually I have absolutely no problem with hand prepared food as long as hands are washed. My MIL’s kitchen set up is one geared towards entertaining too so we were all helping out at our respective work stations when I noticed her long fake nails and the amount of dark brown crud beneath them. I’ve never noticed her wearing them before but all I could see was black filth caked on the underside. 

She saw me looking and snapped that it was just fake tan, and I kinda laughed it off with her and carried on chopping my carrots to make it less awkward that she’d caught me looking. 

I discretely told my wife later on and she shrugged it off and said she didn’t mind- cool, I had done my part and warned her, and I do agree that we probably put all kinds of crap in our mouths without us knowing anyway. 

When it came time for dinner, my wife took some salad, I loaded up on baked potatoes and steak which I honestly genuinely love. I am not known for eating salad anyhow but my SIL immediately offered me some and I took it to be polite and left it on my plate. 

After dinner was over, she launched into an attack because I hadn’t eaten the salad, and she accused me of thinking she wasn’t clean. I told her I had taken exactly what I wanted to take and I didn’t really want the salad, and my MIL and FIL were both surprised at her reaction and asked her to compose herself.

About a year ago she decided that she wanted to adopt a puppy. It is a terrier and she is very sweet but has just SO much energy. It was easier to manage when we lived together but she has moved out and left me alone with the dog. I work a standard 8 hour day with a 30-45 minute commute each way. I just don’t have the time to take care of the dog like I need to and feel guilty every time I come home and the dog has been cooped up in the house for nearly 10 hours.

My ex does not have any family where we live and when we broke up essentially jumped on any lease she could find/afford. She was able to find an apartment with a roommate but it does not allow pets. I asked her to take the dog but she obviously couldn’t and told me she still wants her and that she is going to take her when her lease is up.

I don’t know what they did in between meeting them and sitting, but the place was completely fucking messy,

4685,Asshole,"This is going to sound really petty, and maybe it is really petty, so please tell me if I'd be TA for this.

My sister is a couple years older than I, we're both in our late 20s. Our parents raised us in a low/middle income environment, so we didn't come from much growing up. We both got jobs in the careers we studied for, found suitable partners who also have good work. Her husband is a software developer like her. Like us, they've lived in a condo for years and been saving money for a home. I've never asked how much they make and vice versa but it's always been obvious they must make a bit more, now I know it's A LOT more.

My sister and I have always split our parents' Christmas, birthday, and all else presents. If we buy a $500 gift for example (like jewelry), we split it $250 each, sometimes it's a lot on my end but I don't mind because our parents are wonderful. It's worth mentioning that I always do all of the work as well - idea, buying, packaging gift, she just sends the money.

Earlier this year, my sister and her fiance purchased a home in the city for $4 million with a down payment of over 500k ... meanwhile my husband and I are still trying to save for a down payment that's WAY less than that.

While of course I was incredibly happy for them, helped them move in, bought them a new home present, etc., it obviously shocked myself (and everyone in our family) to the core. This is a couple who has denied coming out to dinner because they ""don't have enough money"" so knowing they can afford a home like that and the down payment is absolutely crazy.

Anyways, fast forward to now and our mom's birthday is coming up.. My sister messages me asking what we should get this year and I just don't feel comfortable anymore doing this, splitting on the cost like we're equals.

I know we're equal to our parents, but IMO it just seems weird now asking me to do all the work and pay half when my sister knows I'm making so much less than her. Not to mention that now that everyone knows they're millionaires, she could do some of her own work and buy her own gifts?

WIBTA if I asked my sister to break this tradition? It's been years but I think my parents would understand, especially because I've heard plenty of members in our family whispering / talking about how much money my sister and her fiance make and why they acted like they didn't before type thing (nothing terrible).

I’ve just returned to work since having my Bub. I’m a coeliac and obviously can only eat gluten free. I make a special lunch everyday for work. 

4 days in a row my first week back at work and my food was ‘going missing’ when I’d go to get it from the fridge. I sent out an email to all staff in the office about it. 

The next day the same thing again so I went to my boss. He sent out an email reminding people to only eat their food. 

The next day it happened again. FYI I have my name on it. I asked my boss if we could put cameras in the lunch room, he said no. I asked if he would comp my lunch expenses as I had to buy from the local cafe and shits expensive yo! He again said no. I sent out another email and spoke to as many people as I could (about 15 out of the 20 in my office). 

The next day I was feeling more positive. I left a note on my food again stating it was mine and to not touch it. Lunch time comes around again and my food is gone. I was pissed so I threw out everything that was in the fridge. 

No one technically knows it was me, as I haven’t admitted to doing it, just like the jerk off stealing my lunches hasn’t come forward.

2232,Not the A-hole,"My former husband (42) came out as a transsexual woman last year. As a male he had recently started to get into crossdressing but assured me it was just a fetish, so I was taken by surprise when he came out as he was always a very traditional, masculine guy. She (now Laura) has not started HRT yet but is living fulltime as a woman. Laura and I no longer live together but we share custody of my son (10).

Ever since I moved out and Laura has started living on her own, she has started to dress in extreme clothing. She's gone from wearing relatively normal dresses and skirts to microminis, fishnets, big heels, the full nines, and bold makeup too. Laura is a tall woman (6'4 or so) so in the heels she is very visible and this is what had brought on my current issue.

I am fine with what Laura wants to wear privately but my son is having an extremely hard time with it, especially when it comes to her picking him from school or taking him out for food. Recently he had a breakdown over it and told me that it was so bad he didn't even want to go to school anymore, and that everyone knew him as the ""drag queens son"".

I tried to talk about this privately to Laura, but she gave me the cold shoulder over the phone. My son asked me to come out with him next meeting so we could bring it up together there. The moment she walked in all eyes were on us because of what she was wearing. People were obviously listening and when I gently tried to bring up the topic and explain how our son was feeling, Laura became incredibly loud and angry over it and accused me of feeding my son lines because I was jealous of her confidence. To make matters worse, a table of nearby girls decided to join in and hurl abuse at me and tell me that I was a piece of shit for saying what I was.

she also showers once every 4 or so days but because of her size she cant wash everything and so she will normally stink, and sadly it's the kind of stink you notice. 

I started suggesting we do fun stuff at her place as an alternative and it worked for a while untill she caught on and asked me why we never go out. I just explained that it was because of her weight and that I struggle to walk that slowly and have that many stops.

19036,Asshole,"I am 19M, and my sister (22F) got married about a week ago. She was rather mean to me growing up, and I still don't like her very much.

Several months ago, we were all having dinner as a family. I was asked by my sister if I could be the organist for her wedding. She told me that she can't pay me, but that I can have food at the buffet. Since most of the gigs that I do are paying ones, I initially said that she's going to have to pay me. But my parents got mad at me and told me that it's unreasonable to expect family to pay me for playing music. I asked my sister if there'll be vegan options for her buffet, and she told me that she'll make sure that there will be. So I gave in and agreed to play as long as she has vegan options for me.

When I arrived on the day of the wedding, my sister came over and told me that she wasn't able to get any vegan options for the buffet, so she got an Impossible Whopper for me from Burger King on her way there. Not only was that completely insulting, it has mayo in it so it isn't even vegan. I told her that I'm not going to play for the wedding unless she sends me $200 on Venmo right now. She went and discussed it with her fiancé, only to be told that she can't do that. So I immediately left the wedding and muted my sister, her fiancé, and my parents on my phone. There was no music for the wedding ceremony. I went to go see a movie with my friends instead.

When I got home, my parents were predictably very angry and screaming at me. But I refused to apologize. I honestly don't care that much what they think anymore at this point because I'm already moving out in less than a month.

17002,Everyone Sucks,"First, sorry for the wall of text there’s a TL;DR  at the end 

(FYI: I personally DON’T like porn for ME, I can’t get off from it. BUT *PLEASE* I don’t mind my SO watching it, *DONT ASSUME THAT*. My dislike for porn ISNT why I’m mad.) 

So me and my SO just got into an argument where I absolutely lost my shit. 
For starters, we have had multiple fights in the past about his lack of communication / lying habits.

This fight in particular started because my SO was watching porn and masturbating, in the bed with me while I slept... I initially thought he was looking at my nudes and got turned on and we ended up having sex. Afterwards, he asks to shower. I showered last night so declined and just went back in bed after cleaning up. I was curious as to what nudes in particular he was looking at, so I opened his phone and found the porn. I was a bit sad, ngl I felt like I wasn’t good enough because I was RIGHT there and he has so many of my nudes... I was just shocked. 
When he gets back into bed I simply ask him what he was looking at.

(a little while back, I bought a dildo and wanted to start using it - his response was “what’s the difference between that dildo and another dudes dick” / “you have me, you don’t need the dildo” so I was curious to see what the fuck his excuse was for watching porn if I’m “right here” ) 

He ignores the question and just says “reddit”, then I ask “why were you touching yourself then?” And he lies to my face and says “no, I was just touching my balls I wasn’t masturbating”  (I KNOW he was masturbating, I’ve been with this dude for 3ish years..) 

After a while I keep asking and he finally admits to watching porn. I ask, “why didn’t you tell me in the first place? Why’d you lie?”and his response is “I was embarrassed.” I get it, I do, but he still lied...

I then ask him what the difference between me using a dildo and him watching porn and fantasying TO the porn: “the dildo is a physical object, porn is not.” 

I’m honestly pretty pissed he’s able to go ahead and say “no I don’t like the dildo, it’s basically cheating” and further discourage me from using it, to him just watching porn and masturbating? He also said that it was a “substitute” for having sex with me?! But, I can’t have one?! 

I brought that up and he said “Nono I never said you COULDN’T use it, I said I didn’t like it” (oh yeah, so telling me it’s basically cheating is really going to make me feel great about using the dildo).

I generally wouldn’t care if he watched porn IF he wouldn’t put me down for using a dildo?? Is it just me, or is he a hypocrite?

Sorry for the long post, wanted to get as much info in here, but finally I just want to ask: Am I The Asshole here?

TD;LR : my SO hated the idea of me using a dildo, told me it was “basically cheating” because he’s “right here”,  then goes on to watch porn in our bed right next to me and expects me to be a-okay with it.

Edit: I don’t mind him watching porn, I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST IT. Yes I know I said that I personally don’t like it, but that doesn’t mean my SO can’t. I never said that. I thought I clearly said that I’m just frustrated he was treating me unfairly, PLEASE. I have NOTHING against OTHER people watching porn.

I never wanted it to be a big deal and I mostly ignored some of the hateful comments I got. 

I never wanted and still do not want to be part of the Pride movement. I just want to be able to live my life with my boyfriend. 

My older brother is currently overseas and has a son Aaron, who is 13, with his wife. When my brother is away I kind of step up and help out with Aaron when I can.

I picked up Aaron from school on Friday and he seemed more quiet than usual. I asked him what was going on and he told me that he needed to talk to me. 

He the proceeded to come out to me and told me that I was his “role model” and that I’m the only one who knows that he’s gay. 

I got uncomfortable but thanked Aaron for telling me and made an excuse about having to get to work.

I just have no interest in being a “gay role model” for any kid. It’s not something I ever wanted. Maybe this makes me selfish, but I came out for myself, not to be part of a movement. 

He texted me later that night thanking me for “being so cool about it.” 

I took some time and sent him the following message: 

“Thank you for telling me Aaron. While I understand why you would tell me, I don’t think I am the right person to support you through this.  Please go see your guidance counsellor at school or talk to The Trevor Project or a group like that. I am not entirely comfortable being a role model for you and I think you should look elsewhere for some support.”

I never received a response from him and when I talked to his mom today, she told me that he was upset all weekend but obviously she had no idea why he was so upset. 

I don’t think that I am the asshole generally in this situation as I never asked to be a role model and I don’t think I am required to take that on, but I don’t know if my message was a little to harsh with him.

5005,Not the A-hole,"My sister has BPD and had whatever they’re calling a psychotic break now a couple months ago. She treated her husband terribly, and acted out when he told her he wanted a divorce. She acted like a demented child in an attempt to get her way and now the rest of the family is cleaning up her mess. She was in the hospital for a week then went to live at a treatment center where she will be for a while. She didn’t want to go and was basically forced. I’ve been really over her bullshit for a long time. My opinion is: mentally ill or not, abuse is abuse and she’s incredibly abusive and manipulative. I’m also angry that she’s “unable” to hear any negative feelings from anyone because she can’t handle it right now.

She has two young children that me and my mom are caring for. Her husband is around doing his part but works a lot. 

Last week my grandma fell and broke her hip. She’s in the hospital and will need to spend a while in a rehab center. On top of taking care of my niece and nephew I am also handling grandma. I picked out a rehab center and have everything set up. Well, apparently my mom told my sister about what’s going on. Last night I started getting texts from my sister (who I haven’t spoken to since her tantrum) asking why grandma is going to the rehab I picked out (because of a review she read online) saying she thinks she should go to this other one (45 minutes away). Then I get a call from my mom saying she got similar messages. My mom actually had the NERVE to say “maybe we should look into it so everyone agrees.”

Excuse me, WHAT?! Everyone completely agreed with what I had arraigned and it made the most sense (insurance, location, qualifications) and then someone who 1. will take no part in facilitating this or visiting grandma 2. is too crazy to take accountability for her own actions but apparently can take accountability for grandma? voices her opinion and we’re supposed to listen to it? I put in all that effort to make plans on top of everything else I’m doing, and she looks stuff up on her phone and we’re supposed to care?

Yeah, how about she come home and at least take care of her OWN kids and maybe I’d be willing to hear it but considering the circumstances I’m PISSED. I feel like you don’t get to have it both ways. Are you out of your mind right now or not? You can’t act like an adult and need to let other people handle your business while you get yourself together? Okay then stay in your lane.

10375,Not the A-hole,"My husband has a 5 year old daughter. The first time I met her was a few months ago when she came to stay for the summer. She's a lovely little girl but she has (what I consider) two major habits that bother me:

1) She lies, A LOT. Sometimes about small things sometimes about pretty big things.


2) She cries to get her way, A LOT. I mean screaming at the top of her lungs crying. She'll stop when you leave the room and start when you come back. She doesn't do it to me as much anymore because I won't give her a) the attention she wants or b) the items she wants. She cried so much at one point we had to take her to the ER because her eye was swollen shut for a day.

So the issue is that he'll punish her for lying, but only when it affects him. If it isn't something that matters to him he'll laugh. She literally said ""I told a big lie"" and he laughed at it.

Now when he gets angry over her lying I tell him I don't want to hear it. I've told him she does it because he and her mother let her get away with it and his response is that its normal for a 5 year old to lie and cry this much. I disagree (I also have 2 children). He isn't happy when I say something about her behavior being inappropriate and he isn't happy when I ignore him being angry over that same behavior.

She's going to start kindergarten soon and this behavior isn't going to fly there. I love her and that's why I care. If I didn't love her I wouldn't give a shit.

AITA for telling him that her behavior isn't normal and that it's his (and her mother's) fault she does this?

11932,No A-holes here,"The very last semester in my school was going great regarding my GPA, until one of my (female) teachers decided to ruin it. We were given assignments that were extremely important for our grades and thus I tried my best to write a good essay. She graded it as 7 points, a C- (15 being the best in German schools), even though I was certain that it should've been above 12 points/B+. I showed my essay to several other teachers to see if I might've gotten overconfident, but they agreed that it should've been at least a B.
I asked if she was willing to talk about the grades in a one-on-one conversation and she agreed. On that day, I was very well prepared and gave her clear evidence why it couldn't have been a C-. She stood right there in shock and might've understood that she was too harsh. Nevertheless, she got extremely angry and told me how disrespectful and rude I was.

I was very confused and asked if she was okay, however she left without clarifying whether she would change the grade or not. While I have to admit my voice is deep and can be loud at times (especially in that situation since I was in a rather bad mood), I wasn't trying to be disrespectful. 
I additionally want to mention that she's usually a very nice, understanding and funny teacher...but to me, it seems as if she's emotionally unstable and isn't able to react in stress situations very well (a similar incident has happened in the past).

It was the prankster of the classroom and was into football, which made him behave a tad macho. He told me that he had difficulties with me being gay, but liked me as a person so he would try to get over it. I said I respected that, we made a lot of jokes about it, we talked to eachother sometimes and untill he changed class, we had regular contact.

You could send them and write a little card attached to it that said who it was from and a reason why you sent it. I send some to a few friends and decided to send one to that guy too as a prank. I wrote my name on it and a little heart.

I always used to joke with it a tad, but have told him many times that I could never be into him, so I thought it would be a good prank. He apparently didnt think so.

When I was walking past them that day, his entire friend group was staring at me. I asked (already laughing on the inside): ""Did you like the rose?""
He exclaimed ""So it was really you?!"" And I laughed loudly and walked away, signaling that it was a joke. I didnt see him again that day (school was ending at that time) and went home.

Hear me out on this one.

In regards to ages, I’m 17, Dad is 43, and father’s wife 27 or 28.

Six years ago, it came out during couple’s therapy that my father was cheating on my mom and that his mistress was pregnant. My mom initiated divorce. Six months after the divorce was finalized, my father married his now wife and they had three kids. My dad has apologized for his actions and we are still doing therapy, so one day I can truly forgive him.

I do not like my so-called stepmom, but in regards that she is father’s wife, I begrudgingly show respect. I have never called her out of her name until later in this story. If she speaks to me, I will say something back. If I am in her home, I will clean up after myself. However, I will always refer to her as my father’s wife and she will never be a prominent figure in my life. This is something she cannot accept.

I have never let my true feelings about her be known, until the other day. While at my father’ house, she attempted to make a cringe-worthy joke about my girlfriend with the saying “The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice,” and said that I was good enough looking boy and she was confused about why I would go out with a dark-skinned black girl and not someone white like myself. I guess the look on my face told her to shut up, so she changed the subject.

She then revealed that when my dad gets back from his TDY (Temporary Duty Assignment); she had booked a photoshoot for family portraits of us and she wanted to do a special photo of me and her two sons holding signs that say “Don’t mess with her,” with her 2-month-old daughter. I have never been in any of the previous family portraits because I refused to and my Dad said I didn’t have to.

I told her I was not going to participate

She asked why I was being difficult and that just she wanted family pictures with all of her children.

Six years’ worth of hurt came out. I told her she was a fool to ever think I was her child or that I considered her family. From my perspective, she was nothing, but my father’s racist side chick, who had nothing better to do, but chase after a married man and sit on her ass all day. I took it a step further and fully implied that her daughter wasn’t my father’s child because she looks nothing like him.

She turned red and started crying, saying how disrespectful I was and I had no right to talk to her in such a manner. I fully admit I called her a Bitch and stated she didn’t even deserve any respect from me because she didn’t respect my mother’s marriage and if she ever disrespected my girlfriend again, she would live to regret it. After realizing what I had said, I left and haven’t talked to her since.

3921,Not the A-hole,"In my home town, there's one dedicated group for Dungeons and Dragons for teenagers. I, (16 M), joined a running campaign. The campaign was extremely serious and grim dark. I created a human bard who's a big nerd for music theory who's overly friendly, but also quick to anger. I have a nasty habit of getting caught in the moment and saying stupid shit. That cultivated to a head when we were fighting the BBEG and I called it a 'big dumb shit face' using Vicious Mockery (A spell where you insult a foe and it hurts) and it kills. Me and one other guy out of a group of eight are the only ones laughing. 

We'll call the guy who laughed 'Chris'. He becomes important later. Both Chris and I and friends with the DM. Throughout the campaign I did a few, kind of minor jokey things. The DM pulls me aside and is like, 'you fucker, this was my big moment and you made a stupid joke.' Keep in mind, we are all awkward and hormonal teenagers.

Despite what I felt, at the time, triumphant, I now felt like shit. I apologized, I took my stuff and left. I actually in retrospect feel bad. Later the DM sends me a strawpoll over Discord showing the majority of the group decided to kick me. One voted not to kick me. Obviously I'm angry, but it's not like I didn't expect it. I send a good bye message to the group. I kinda get ghosted by the group, which made me feel worse. I was a mess for a bit because I felt like an idiot and was confused, but then I decided to stop pitying myself and resolved to make my own campaign with my own players, one that wasn't as grim dark, one that was serious but also had a lot of room for comedy and jokes. I create a world and invite five people who were not involved with the previous campaign and to my surprise, everyone joins. This is where it gets bad.

I run session zero and hey, these new players are pretty good, they roleplay and interact. On the cusp of starting the actual first session, Chris wants to join my campaign. I asked him like 'Hey, aren't you still apart of DM's campaign?"" He was like, ""Yeah""... in something I probably shouldn't of done in retrospect. I said yes. New group mates love Chris and his char. This is when things went from bad to worse. 

I receive a message from old DM and he is *furious*. He said that I was so shit at Dungeons and Dragons that I needed to steal his players to have any chance. Apparently Chris jokingly shit-talked old DM's campaign and gave old DM the heads up that he was leaving to join mine. 

Now, supposedly, over Discord messages between Chris and old DM, they argued over me and now hate each other and I'm being used as the arguing point. By connection to Chris, old DM hates me too. One of the members of the old group sends me a message saying if I hadn't made a new campaign, no one would be arguing and that we'd all still be friends and that this is my fault... which still doesn't add up because they ghosted me after I was kicked so I'm not sure most of those guys were even my friends.

9671,Not the A-hole,"Essentially the title, but more complicated.

I had the unfortunate fortune of being born a gay man into a very evangelical family. I came out right after high school, riding the high of being recently graduated, only for my parents to tell me I was disgusting, not the child they raised, that I was being punished by god and if I was choosing to turn my back on him, they were choosing to turn their backs on me. These are all actual, quotable things they said to me at 18. 

I’m 27 now, and while at first we were somewhat in contact, after the first 3 years or so the only way I’d hear from or about my parents was through my younger brother, the only one of my 3 siblings willing to speak to me. I am in a loving and committed relationship, I am happy, and until now I thought my parents and family were in my past. Well, lo and behold, my cousin, my fathers sisters son, just came out!! Great for him, I’m proud of him. He is also 18, and his parents were confused but accepted him and now they are doing great and are happy and are an intact family. I guess my parents saw that and realized their mistake, because I got a call from a strange number that turned out to be my mom. That call ended up being nearly an hour of them explaining their mistakes and misunderstanding and blah blah blah. I think it’s bullshit. They don’t love me enough for me to allow them back into my life, and I know this because they shunned me for close to a decade. I ended the call by saying I had a lot to think about, and they didn’t seem pleased with that. As if showing love for their eldest son was such an amazing feat. I may be an asshole for this, but I can’t find it in my heart to forgive them. I’m happy now, but the last decade of my life has been filled with pain, isolation, confusion, and self hatred, and the majority of that was their fault.

22300,Not the A-hole,"I'm not super religious, but I grew up with it. My dad is Jewish, mum is Catholic, and I was raised in both faiths, but as an adult I've sort of stepped away from religion. However, some stuff remains, including the Jewish practice of writing His name as ""G-d"". As a child, I was taught this was a sign of respect, and now as an adult it's more of a habit than anything, but I feel genuine discomfort when I write His full name.

I'm in uni on a literature course and for my most recent round of assessments we were given a bunch of religious stories and asked to write about one. One was about someone's struggle between the Jewish and Catholic faiths so I was like ""yup, that's mine"" and wrote my essay on it. I had to write ""G-d"" about 10 times in my essay, and did debate using the full version but it just didn't sit right with me.

I felt pretty good about the essay as my average grade #is a high B, with the occasional A, but a few weeks later I got it back and it was a D. Specifically, it was the highest possible D grade (49%). In the notes, it said that it was a really good essay, but unfortunately they couldn't grade me higher than a D due to ""a repeated spelling error"". I then saw the only word they'd marked as misspelled was ""G-d"".

I figured the just didn't know about the whole situation with His name, so I submitted it for re-marking, and in the box where I'm meant to explain why I think it's marked incorrectly I explained my use of ""G-d"".

My essay got sent to a different marker, marked at an A (86%), with the new marker commenting basically everything the first marker said about it being a great essay, without the thing about spelling.

About a week ago I got an email from someone at the university who I don't know asking if they could have a copy of my essay. I assumed he was a moderator wanting to check my new grade so I sent it. Today I got an email asking for my account of the grading as the lecturer is being investigated for antisemitism.

I'm staying with mum and dad and I don't know what to do, so I told them. Dad says I did the right thing and they wouldn't do this over one student complaining about a bad grade, there were probably other incidents. Mum, however, thinks I went too far, should have just taken the grade as it doesn't count towards my degree as I'm a first year and only grades from years 2 and 3 go to overall grades, and that I should have realised asking for a re-mark based on Jewish practices would start shit for this lecturer and that I may have compromised her career over a grade that won't matter in September. She says I should respond to the email saying that there was no antisemitism at play here, while my dad thinks I should just let things play out and go along with the investigation. If they're not antisemitic, they get to prove it, if they are, they get dealt with by the uni in an appropriate way.

When it comes to the exams, it's completely random which subject you will have to take your exams in. It's a poll, and you have one random written exam, and one random oral exam. You get to know the subject just days before the exam takes place. 

My son is an average student, but has always struggled with math. We found out he has to take his written exam in math. The grade you get on your exam is based solely on that one exam, but counts as much as a final grade in any subject. His average as of now is 4,4, but if he does bad in his exams it might drop to 4,2 (still on a scale from 1 to 6.) This could very possibly determine if he gets into the school he wants to or not.

If he is sick and can't attend his exam, nothing happens. He doesn't have to retake it. I think the system of random exams with such an important grade is completely idiotic, and I don't support it. I encouraged him to fake being sick, get a note from the doctor and ditch the exam.

My wife is furious at me, and says we have to teach him to be honest and never cheat. I think we should teach him to do what's best for him and his future.

So my school made this dumb rule that nobody can have a water or drink bottle with them because a couple seniors got caught drinking vodka at school.

The only exception is if you have a form signed by your doctor saying there's a medical reason you need it. And carry the note with you whenever you have a water bottle so you can show it to teachers or administration.

Now, my doctor who i have my yearly checkup with is also one of my mom's best friends, and last week she and her daughter were coming around to hang out with our family.

I was telling her and my mom about the school rule and they thought it was silly too. My doctor was talking about how unhealthy it was to not let kids drink water all day, and sell them sugary sodas at lunch 

I asked if she'd sign a doctor's note allowing me a water bottle and she said od course. So I printed out the form and she signed it. There was a section saying to describe the medical need and she wrote ""water is necessary for life"" which my  mom thought was funny but also thought might get the note rejected, like it was obviously meant for specific medical conditions or disabilities. 

But she said that if anyone had a problem with it, to have them call her and they'd get a piece of her mind.

So I took the note to school and a bunch of teachers told me I couldn't have a water bottle and I said I had a note. Most of them didn't read it closely enough to see the reson but out of the two that did, one laughed about it and asked if it was real. I said it was, she could call the number on the form. She seemed satisfied.

The other teacher threatened to take the note away, saying medical exemptions were not a joke, it was a disrespectful thing to do, disrespectful to the school's rules and disrespectful to people who had an actual medical need, to treat it as a joke.

I know my doctor hadn't meant it as a joke about actual medical problems...

19474,Asshole,"My mom had me at 14. She went off to college at 18 and I stayed behind with my grandparents who raised me until I was eighteen. She wasn’t really in my life and I don’t feel like much was lost. My grandparents were still young and I was raised with my uncles and aunts who weren’t too far from my age. She ended up remarrying and having a new family. 

She moved back to our hometown early last year and we reconnected. Before she would come visit every other year but now she was actually living here full time. I’m now 35 with two kids, 11 and 6. My moms 49 and her kids are 13 and 10. Her youngest and my oldest were supposed to be attending the same middle school/junior high in the fall. 

My mom constantly complains that it’ll be embarrassing to have all the other moms in the PTA know that we’re mother and daughter and that our kids are close in age... I was like okay. She basically wants to befriend my friend group of moms but she’s embarrassed to BE my mom.

2074,Not the A-hole,"I \[23M\] am getting married next summer and my fiancee \[22F\] and I are still in the planning stages of our wedding - including still divvying out roles for our family/friends. My cousin Meagan has had 2 kids since getting married a few years ago, Lily and Michael. Given that they are the youngest family members out of both my fiancee's family and mine, we were talking about our wedding during a family BBQ and how the guest list was coming along. I let them know that it's slowly but surely coming together and in that moment talked about possibly having Michael be our ring bearer and Lily be our flower girl. Everyone in our family thought this would be a fun/cute idea . . .

 . . . Everyone except my Aunt Bri and her 12 year old son (my cousin) Andrew. Andrew is a brat; he is a really an only child despite having two older siblings and always throws fits whenever he doesn't get his way - like dragging himself on the ground, hiding/running away, ignoring people, and pouting/crying. My Aunt Bri and Uncle Ken hardly do anything to address these fits other than threatening to go home. They don't give a shit about what kind of video games he plays, how he talks back to them or the rest of our family (light cursing and addressing family by first name rather than Aunt \[My mom's name\] or Grandma \[My Grandma's name\]). There is no way around this, kid is just a pain in the ass. He was born well after my cousin Meagan and her older brother Patrick were (age difference of at least 12+ years between them) and so has sort of always gotten his way growing up with virtually no siblings in the picture. 

Later during my family visit, my  grandma pulled me aside and asked if I had any plans to include Andrew in our wedding in anyway. I asked why. My grandma then mentioned that I made my Aunt/Uncle/Andrew a little upset by offering my cousins toddlers roles in the wedding but not offering Andrew a special role in the wedding as a little groomsmen or something else and that I should really ask him/do something special for him like get him a toy while asking.

I turned to my Grandma and my mom - who was also in on the conversation - and I said ""No. I honestly don't think Andrew deserves any kind of special role. Kid is a spoiled brat to be honest and I just can't see him not throwing some kind of fit or crying about something on the day of our wedding."" My mom agreed with me as she has always felt the same way about her nephew and like me, felt that he would not be respectful/behaved and would try to make it about him - the way he always tries to. My grandma, however, slightly disagreed and said that I should really consider it and that ""he is family.""

TL;DR  My aunt and uncle are upset with me for not asking my 12 yo cousin to be a groomsmen/have some special role in my wedding next year despite my cousin being a brat and my fiancee and I asking my other cousin to have her 2 toddlers as our flower girl and ring bearer",141,418,0.95,WIBTA for refusing to include my 12 year old cousin in my groomsmen party?,dj8lr7,2019-10-17 16:13:44,NTA,2968,WIBTA,"The author, a 23-year-old groom-to-be, is planning his wedding and has chosen his younger cousins, Lily and Michael, to be the flower girl and ring bearer.

21598,Not the A-hole,"So basically my knee got dislocated for a second and relocated itself at work. I have had 2 surgeries on my knee in the past for permanent dislocation, this was the first time that it popped back in. I was walking down the stairs at work and almost fell down as it happened. I felt an immense amount of pain in my whole leg and absolutely panicked. Am I going to need surgery for the third time? Is my knee going to dislocate permanently again? I went through rehab twice in order to walk again because of that.

I called my local emergency room (not 911) and asked them if I could come or if I should wait until tomorrow (it hapened at 11:30PM european time), since I wasnt sure if this issue could wait, or if it needed immediate treatment because of my previous hospital stays.

The woman on the phone was really unpolite and didnt give me a straight answer, saying something alone the line of ""If you think its important you should come"".

So my dad drove me to the hospital. As I arrived at the reception, I said what happened and the receptionist cut me off immediately. I recognised her behaviour - she was the woman I spoke to on the phone earlier. She acted like I was a total inconvenience to the whole staff (even tho I was literally the only person there)

After they assigned me to a room, the nurse in there had a constant mocking smile on her face, as if I was a hypochondriac. I explained my situation and she seemed to be pretty pissed off. A doctor came in and inspected my knee, telling me that everything was looking fine - great news so far! He asked me if I wanted an x-ray and again, I asked if it was necessary, given that I the knee seemed to be fine and the staff were completely rude to me. And again, he told me that its my choice. Just to be safe, I agreed to the x-ray. 

Before I went there, I told the nurse that I just wanted to make sure that I dont need to undergo surgery again, and that I was really paranoid because of the dislocation. She just gave me a dismissive look and exited the room.

The colleauge at the x-ray was rude too. She acted like she didnt want to be there and she opnely showed me that she didnt like me. 

After the x-ray the doctor told me that everything looked fine, but that I should wear my orthopedic splint just to be sure. I thanked them and I left the emergency room, relieved that this time, no permanent damage was made to my knee.

So Reddit - AITA? I asked the emergency room in advance to make sure its worthy being checked out immediately or if I should wait until tomorrow and go to a doctor. Im absolutely aware of the fact that emergency rooms are for emergencies only and that my situation probably wasnt deemed as such.

Last year we got a beautiful cat who is the grand baby neither of our parents will ever have. 

She’s obviously an obligate carnivore and we’ve been feeding her kibble and wet food. 

Unfortunately, where she came from wasn’t a very good situation and she had horrible teeth when we rescued her. It hasn’t come to a point where she’s painful and doesn’t want to eat kibble but if it does, wet food will just make it worse. 

We went on a website for rawfeeding animals and bought her some chicken necks and chicken hearts. According to the vet, this should encourage her to use her teeth as it smell “more appetising” than space nuggets. 

We’ve obviously been quite uncomfortable with this as it’s raw meat in our otherwise vegan home but we’d do anything for our little gremlin so it’s worth it. 

We’ve since had some friends over who were horrified when we got raw meat out and asked us if we weren’t vegan and we said that we were and still are, but that kitty is not. 

They’re now saying we’re fake vegans and that we don’t care about animal welfare if we’re feeding her raw meat. 

We don’t see the issue, as these are part of a chicken that humans wouldn’t eat and we are following what our vet told us to keep our baby at optimal health. In our minds, these parts of already slaughtered animals would otherwise just be thrown away. 

This has created quite a bit of drama in our friend group as some people are now accusing us of being hypocrites while the other half say that we’re just caring for our cat. 

Are we the assholes here? 

Edit 1: if we didn’t feed her raw meat she would have kibble instead but she’s reluctant to eat that when her teeth are sore.

Edit 2: first of all, holy shit. We did not expect this response. We posted this on a whim because we were unsure if we should stop calling ourselves vegan or not. Not feeding her meat was never an option.

My daughter (10) has been having an increasingly difficult time going to school as she’s getting teased (we’ve done all we can to get it to stop and are thinking about transferring schools if it doesn’t improve, we have  also gotten counselling for her so she doesn’t think less of herself and spend as much time with her as possible)

We walk her to the school bus but since we work we can’t stand with her to make that happen and we don’t want to make the teasing worse PLUS we would like for her to want to go to school, if we forced her to she wouldn’t learn.

She’s wanted a rabbit for some time now and we have told her that if she attends school 100% that on her birthday  she would get a rabbit, her dads idea at the time.

We would make sure it was fed and tidied so I wouldn’t be dumping a living thing on her, plus she’d get a chart to sign every time she’s fed and cleaned it.

We got a rabbit run, hutch, toys, food, hay all for the rabbit - hidden obviously  since her birthday is next week.

Two weeks ago I found out I was pregnant, we’re over the moon.

Since then however my partner has decided it just isn’t the right time to get our daughter the rabbit but she’d be getting a sibling.

He hasn’t told my daughter and I know what her reaction would be and how upset she would be, it also makes me think that the way she sees this would be that we don’t keep our word and now that we’re having a baby we won’t care for her as much.

I've told her several times that I have a name, I don't like how she'll literally just say ""receptionist"" to my face, but she still does it. It pisses me off to no end.

I've tried to talk to my bosses (husband/husband team, they met in dental school) about this, but Julie has been with them literally since before I was born, so fuck me, I guess, she's their golden girl. Here I was, thinking they had four adopted children, but clearly, there's actually five.

The reason she hates me is because she's been fighting to work front desk for years but my bosses keep hiring externally for the position, so the other assistant told me she's pretty much always been a horse's ass to every receptionist they've hired. Apparently the receptionist before me stormed out crying because of Julie.

As for me, I don't take Julie's crap. I'm here to be professional and do a job, I don't care if she doesn't like me, I just want her to stop calling me ""the receptionist"" because it's rude AF, especially when she refers to me that way to patients right in front of me.

I'm friendly with the Starbucks peeps at this point, and I've even gotten drinks with the manager a few times, so she knows all about Julie. This morning, she jokingly told the employee to write ""the assistant"" on Julie's drink, and for some reason I just insisted they do it. No regrets, just do it.

My bosses and the hygienist laughed their asses off, Julie obviously got mad, but what surprised me was when the other assistant said I shouldn't have stooped to her level. She told me I was being hypocritical because it's true I value professionalism, and now I'm starting to doubt myself. I can't stand Julie, but was a laugh at her expense worth compromising my principles on professionalism? AITA here? I'm typing this on my lunch, so should I apologize to Julie before going home?

1297,No A-holes here,"Hey Reddit, 

I haven’t been able to concentrate all day because I feel like TA but I thought I’d ask the masses. 

My husband and I both live and work in Boston and we have pretty similar work schedules, leaving plenty of time in the evenings to be together. Over the past two weeks I enrolled in intensive therapy to help with an eating disorder so I’m away for most weeknights, not getting home until 9:30. I also need to get into the office by 8 AM to be able to leave early to get to the session on time. This has led to a lot of stress and overall lack of weekly happiness on my end. 

At the same time, my husband is having a really tough time at work. It’s a myriad of the usual problems—a boss that doesn’t care, too much work, no support, etc. The biggest problem is they canned his boss so now he has the workload of two people, no promotion, and they hire new people for his team but only in their Canadian office, not the one in Boston. So he still has no help with this and it’s been nearly a year. 

Our initial plan was to meet up for lunch on the weekdays because by the time I get home from therapy I end up simply going to bed because I’ve been out for 14+ hours. This would allow me to see him at least once during the day. Unfortunately, due to his work issues he hasn’t exactly been joyous during lunch. The past couple of times we’ve met up for lunch he’s been in a HORRIBLE mood due to experiencing some issue at work, whether it's a nasty email or another new hire in the Canada office. He’s unresponsive, unenthusiastic, and the entire time I’m on the verge of tears due to his lack of interest in cheering up and just hanging out with me. 

I’m having a really difficult time dealing with his bad mood during my one hour off in the entire day, so today I told him I couldn’t get lunch because “it stresses me out so much.” It did not go over well--he's not speaking to me. I feel horrible because he doesn’t have a big support system so I am the only one he has to talk to, but I need to try to have just one hour of a genuine break in the day to get me through the next 8-9 hours without his piss-poor attitude and sulking making our lives worse. AITA?

14488,Everyone Sucks,"Last week i received an invitation to my cousin's wedding. It was addressed to me and my parents. I sent Cousin a letter explaining that i wasn't going, but my parents were excited to be there.

A few days later, she called me asking why i wasn't coming.

My cousin is extremely ani-children. Mocks them openly, ridicules people who choose to have them. I'm not the best with kid but i don't hate them. I find people who complain about children to be more obnoxious than the actual children.

As the invitation made it clear the wedding was 18+, i know the wedding is going to end up with Cousin getting drunk and mocking all the parents who couldn't attend due to lack of childcare and making jokes to the parents who DID make it about being 'free from your little demons for the night'. I don't want any part of that.

When she called, i told her i was happy for her, and she's welcome to have the wedding she wants, but i wasn't interested in going to a child free wedding.

In retrospect i should have lied and said i had class or something. But she put me on the spot and Im not good with confrontation. 

She got upset and started arguing with me. She said she wanted everyone together for her wedding and me missing it was ruining her day. I was being stuck up and judgmental at her decision and i dont get to say how she plans her wedding. 

I told her that was true, but she doesn't have a right to decide who accepts her invitations. And if she wanted all the family together, i thought it was pretty shitty to not include children as part of the family. Again, retrospectively, I should've shut up. 

She told me she was taking back my invitation (fine with me, saves me the present i was still going to send her) and was going to reconsider inviting my parents (less ok, they havent done anything to her). Then she hung up. 

I let my parents know what she said. They said that while she went a little overboard, i should've just RSVPd 'Yes' in the first place.

Since she called, there's been several passive aggressive Facebook/Twitter posts, and several other family members have called me trying to get me to reconsider.

I've told them all the same thing: Cousin is welcome to plan her wedding exactly how she wants it, i just won't be there. Still, everyone has been keeping up with it being me who's the problem. That i should put my opinions aside for family, that i shouldn't care because i don't have children, that i should never decline a wedding invitation because it's not about me it's about the couple, etc. 

Now, i know i was the asshole for telling Cousin that i disagreed with her having a child free wedding, even if i was confronted directly. And if i ever get the chance, I'll apologize for being so blunt with her during a stressful time.

My mom doesn't always host Thanksgiving but wanted to this year. This meant \*I\* would also be hosting Thanksgiving, as it's a lot of work so I help her out usually by making dessert and most of the side dishes while she handles turkey, gravy and potatoes. I told her what I was planning on making last week, she said sounds good, and we bought most of the ingredients 3 days ago.

Invited to Thanksgiving was my sister and her husband, her husband's mom, my mom's oldest friend/my godfather, and our elderly neighbour. My sister was to bring wine and the other guests were bring appetizers. Also going to be there would be my mom, dad, brother (30M) and I, who all live in one house. 

Last night, my brother asked if there was anything he could do for Thanksgiving. At that point everything was set and my mom and I were definitely worried about a 'too many cooks in the kitchen' situation as my brother is a chef by trade and has a tendency to take over the whole kitchen just to make salad dressing, so my mom said 'I think we'll be okay but thank you for offering. I'll let you know if you can help out in any way tomorrow.' He started to get a bit insistent on making something but my mom and I both said really we had everything planned, and my dad said as it was, he thought there would be way too much food. 

My brother got up early this afternoon, the day we were hosting Thanksgiving with everyone to come by at 5 and asked my mom to take him to the grocery store because he still really wanted to make a dish. My mom repeated what we said last night and told him it was too late, the stores would be too busy, and at this point another dish would mess up our plans. Additionally, my brother is still getting over a bit of a cold, so my mom wasn't sure if he would be contagious still or not and wasn't really wanting to risk it, considering my sister is very anal about getting sick. He got mad and upset and accused us of not wanting him around and complaining he never does anything around the house but then not letting him doing anything when he does want to. He went down to his room and slammed the door and has been in his room since. 

He is also notorious for throwing a wrench into our plans at the last minute, and he's a very stressful person to be around in the kitchen, as he treats our home kitchen like his restaurant's kitchen and doesn't have much regard for what my mom or I are doing.

Wet clothes are left in the washer for days on end, food is left rotting in the fridge and in the sink for several weeks if I do not clean it, they also just casually throw garbage into the yard. If asked nicely multiple times for them to clean their mess and even not so nicely a few times. 

I am far from the most hygienic person in the world myself, I’ll leave dishes until the next day and just general untidiness but they take it to a different level. 

All this filth (since my refusal to clean it anymore) has brought some new roommates for us, mainly giant ass rats! Which seem to have moved into our yard. 

The kicker is, they are both ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED of rats.

Every few days or so for the past 2weeks ish I have been placing it in the corner of the kitchen, waiting for one of them to walk in. Then I yank Ronald as hard as I can at an angle so he shoots towards them. Each time they’ve ran from the kitchen screaming in fear. 
I won’t lie I very much enjoyed doing it at first but kinda felt guilty at having made a grown man bawl his eyes out and thought the lesson has probably been learned. 

So I decided  we had to have a house meeting about the infestation and how they don’t feel safe in the home anymore (personally I didn’t feel safe with a pan of veggie rice rotting on the countertop for 12days but hey ho!).

My friend who I will refer to as X is Non-Binary.

I have been friends with X since Middle School and we're in college now. Honestly we're more like family at this point if anything.

X has been Non-Binary for about 2 years now but recently decided to change up their name since they have a traditional female name. Whether or not they choose to transition down the line, IF they want to transition down the line, I am completely accepting of it. 

My problem is, the name they chose is extremely similar to my name except one letter off. (Ex: Jaiden/Aiden, Mark/Marcus, Gaby/Gabrie)

When they told our group of friends, I was extremely uncomfortable about the name but was silent. I later confessed to my boyfriend that I have issues with it. He talked with me to get down to the real issue of my discomfort and it's deeper than face level.

I have always had an issue comparing myself to X. Intentionally and Unintentionally. I have always felt that X was the more attractive friend, more likeable, more talented etc. We're similar in tastes, hobbies, attitudes but I've always felt like people could approch them more. People always asked me about X and I've always felt like I was 2nd best to X. X felt like a brand and I was a cheap Great Value imitation of them.

I bring this up because, even though in recent years I've tried extremely hard to not compare myself to them, sharing borderline the same name with them makes it 10x harder not to.

I'm also a bit upset because awhile back they brought up the idea if they should change their name and I even half-jokingly said ""If you think about changing your name dont change it to (similar sounding name) haha ;)"" but...that's exactly what they did.

I love them but this name change hurts me. I feel extremely selfish for asking them to consider a different name but I dont think my mental health can handle it. I love them and don't want to distance myself from our 7/8 year friendship but this name is really putting me off.

We worked through it. We went to counseling, I got help with my depression, and things eventually sorted themselves out and went back to normal. The affair was a little over a year ago. 

One evening a few months ago, I started to think about this woman. I knew her name, so I looked her up on Facebook. I saw that she made art, and looked at her Instagram. Her artwork is beautiful. I found myself checking her Instagram frequently just to look at it. There was one piece that she made around the time of her affair with my husband that really stuck out to me, and I admit I became a bit obsessed with it. 

I eventually messaged her, telling her who I was and the situation, and asked her if it was for sale. She gave it to me. She sent it in the mail, and when it came to me I had it framed. I hung it up in our living room last night. 

When my husband saw it, he immediately recognized it. He got angry, and asked me why I would hang it up. I told him that I loved it, and I couldn’t explain why. I told him about how I had spoken to her, and he got even more upset. He demanded that I the picture down. When I asked him why, he told me I was throwing the affair in his face. I tried to explain that it was not my reasoning, but he wouldn’t listen. He is threatening to leave if I don’t take the picture down, and I think it’s an exteeeme reaction.

21781,Not the A-hole,"This happened a couple of weeks ago and im only posting this because I feel a bit guilty and then read a kinda similar post this morning that reminded me about it. 

I'm 27f, ive been taking antidepressants for around 2 years after an event in uni that gave me ptsd. If I dont take them then I turn into essentially a human Gummi bear who cant do anything except mooch around like a miserable sack of potatoes. Yes i also see a therapist for this as well. 

Anyway, my flatmate of 18months left the country to go home before covid and has now declined to return so I had to find a new flatmate. The girl that I found seemed nice, a bit weird in the typical hippy vegan way but didn't gave a problem with living with someone who eats bacon and i was having trouble finding potential flatmates and can't afford the apartment by myself. 

We agreed to a 6 week trial before she would've signed on for a year. 

Initially everything seemed fine but in the 3rd week I noticed that my anti depressants were occasionally not in the cabinet in the mirning when I woke up(I always take them at 8am before work). Often I would briefly look for them but have to rush out of the house before I could find them. They would usually be back that evening or I'd find them in the other bathroom cabinet or in the vanity next to the toilet. I asked her if she was moving them a couple of times and the first time she said no and the second she said that she was trying to find her health vitamins and had emptied the cabinets looking for them and must have forgotten to put my anti depressants back. I thought this was weird cause nothing else had moved but shrugged it off. 

In the 4th week I couldn't find them for 3 days, confronted her and she offered to help search only for her to ""find"" them in the kitchen cabinets and blamed it on me taking them into the kitchen(I never do). Beginning of the 5th week I couldn't find them again and while I was searching the apartment I saw her open bag and looked inside(yes I know im TA here), low and behold there were my pills. I confronted her that evening and she said she was trying to wean me off them and that I should stop putting that poison in my body. I told her that it wasn't going to work out and to find somewhere else to live. She threw a hissy fit and packed all her stuff that night and left(to be clear I did say she had until the end of the trial period to leave, she didn't have to go immediately). 

Anyways, 4 weeks later I have a new flatmate who seems great, but the girl has been messaging me begging to come back because the friend she's been staying with has kicked her out.

My boyfriend and I hadn’t had sex in over three months, so I knew it wasn’t his, but we reconnected and when I told him he amazingly decided that he would raise our child as his own. 

The biological father of my daughter is no longer in our lives, nor does he know that he has a daughter. He is half Italian, so has very olive toned skin and distinctive facial features. My husband thankfully has naturally olive skin so when our daughter did too, it didn’t cause an issue. 

The fact that he’s not her biological father has never been an issue and we rarely even think about it, he is her dad and he always will be.

11402,Asshole,"I was riding my bike and found a phone in the road face up and literally obliterated. It was to the point where it was beyond recognition but using detective skills I found out it was a note 9. 

I made a Craigslist lost and found ad and haven’t seen any response. I also pulled the SIM card and put it in an old phone to find the number. It turns out it’s the phone of a local businessman who lives a few blocks over. To make a long story short , I tracked him down and found his Facebook and messaged him to say that I found his phone and yadayada. 

It’s been almost a week and I haven’t heard a response. Is it wrong if I unsend my messages and just keep it ? 

Giving it back would be useless because it’s so destroyed that there’s no way he could ever get any data back and I doubt he lacks the knowledge to replace the screen. If i kept it I would fix it if possible and use it in place of my phone. I’m so torn. I’m urgently trying to decide so I can order parts and try to fix it but I’m not fixing it if there’s a possibility it goes back to him.

Edit: I know where he lives,yes. But I’m going to come off as some creepy stalker if I drop it off there because I had to do some real detective work to find his address in the first place. I don’t know him personally nor through a friend, not at all in fact.

6788,Asshole,"This is my first ever post on this sub and I figured it's probably a good idea to use a throwaway so I don't give my wife another reason to be pissed at me. 

She was hosting a party at our house on Saturday. It was honestly more of a work event and she was super excited about it because she wanted it be our first ""mature"" party (meaning their were cocktails/wine as opposed to a keg, little sandwiches as opposed to pizza and our new hot tub was off limits so no bikinis either...I was joking with her that it sounded like the ""no-fun-arty"" which she found mildly amusing the first time I said it but the next 10000, not so much). 

So she got home Friday and worked until almost 2AM preparing and storing all the food she wanted to serve. There was some sort of work emergency at 7AM so she had to go in and I didn't even realize she was gone until I woke up at about 10. She texted me at like 5 and said she was having the most awful day ever and said she was thinking about cancelling the party. I told her that I would help in whatever way I could. She said it would be awesome if I cleaned up. 

I know me and my wife have very different cleaning standards but I very honestly did the best I could. I cleaned up all our mail that accumulates, cleaned the bathroom to what I thought was spotless, wiped down the kitchen and even started to warm up all the food she prepared. 

She ended up getting home at 6:45 and jumped right in the shower. Guests started showing up at 7 and it didn't even occur to me that I was still wearing my dirty cleaning clothes as I was greeting and chatting with her guests.  

She came out and in a stern ""mom voice"" she demanded to talk to me in the bed room. She laid into me like no one's business. I mean a brief laundry list of all my offenses: 

1. not wearing appropriate clothes. She didn't give me credit that I had been cleaning right until 7 because:

2. There was dog hair apparently everywhere, including the couch and there were piles of where it builds up next to the furniture. I had completely forgot to vacuum and everyone was getting dog hair on their clothes from sitting on the couch. 

3. I guess I missed some huge pee spots on the toilet.

4. I had missed her text that I needed to go get ice. 

5. I guess instead of warming up these salmon/cream cheese wheels I was just supposed to take them out but I put them in the oven and ruined them. 

6. and she reminded me of no-fun-arty.

Even with all that, the party went off just fine but it's Wednesday now and she is still made at me and says that my behavior and the jokes in the weeks leading up to the party show that I didn't even care how much it meant to her and my behavior that day makes her think I don't even care about her.

I had a friend who I'll refer to as F. F has a super difficult home life. Her parents are abusive, she has untreated depression and anxiety, she lives in a house with a lot of drugs and alcohol and it's overall just an awful living situation. My living situation is close to perfect. I live alone with my Dad (who makes a really good income- enough to support a family of 4-5 easily, so we don't struggle) who I get alone with extremely well. My Dad has never smoked, doesn't drink and certainly never does drugs. I don't have any mental health issues and I truly love my life.

Recently F has been distant. A couple of days ago she was EXTREMELY rude. She followed me around for the day constantly butting into conversations that she wasn't even involved in by saying ""I don't care"". I didn't snap at her, or really do anything because I know some people have worse days then others.

I was however talking to F about how I might have to put down one of my pets soon (a rat, but this rat literally means the world to me.) and she once again butts in with ""I don't care"".

I still didn't comment on it, because I'm more mature then that and I refuse to lose my cool over 3 words repeated over and over again. However, about 5 minutes later we were all cracking jokes/sharing funny stories and I mentioned how the day before I ""lost"" one of my rats (they all come when they're called, and if they don't, my dog loves them and she'll find them in an instant - my dog would never hurt them, she just likes to watch them). Pretty much she jumped off my table because I left them and she went after me. Before I could finish the story (she had jumped high onto my tv unit and was licking the TV) F suddenly blurts out ""Good, I hope she died"" and continued on cracking jokes like before.

I looked at her in obvious disgust, stood up and said that I wouldn't be talking to her again and that was extremely inappropriate for her to say something like that to me, especially so soon after I was talking about my pet needing to be put down. I told her that just because she has a bad day doesn't give her ANY right to behave this way to another human let alone a friend. She responded with ""I don't care"". I walked away and I haven't talked to her since.

She found me later that day and tried to apologise but I shot that down straight away by simply telling her I meant what I said earlier and I walked away yet again.

I know she was being completely childish but I also NEVER snap at people. I don't raise my voice and I do feel I might be overreacting.

This counsellor has repeatedly worn short-shorts, and has also repeatedly tied her shirts up w/ a rubber band to show a part of her midriff / lower back. I have spoken w/ her a few times and even given formal warnings but she hasn't changed her ways, just started hiding it (wearing a longer skirt on top and removing the rubber band when I was around). Other counsellors decided to start doing so as well as they found out that she was violating dress code repeatedly w/ no apparent consequences. I hesitated to fire her originally  because she was otherwise very competent and well liked but I cannot allow special exceptions for certain people so I let her go. Some parents were not happy with the way she dressed, but liked her as a counsellor and stated that I shouldn't have fired her.

15539,Not the A-hole,"Hi, all. I'm going to be a little deliberately vague about specifics, because my partner is a Redditor, too. 

We're both in our 20s and have been together for nearly a decade. We just relocated to a new city for SO's career, but are making very little money and it's tough to make ends meet sometimes. We currently both work in the gig economy, so income can be unpredictable from week to week. SO comes from a wealthy family, and it's their family who is helping us out with our rent, so our primary expenses are food, gas, groceries, and utilities. 

Well, my SO is crazy irresponsible with finances, even with the little money we do have. Part of it isn't in their control, because they have a mental illness, and one of the main symptoms is compulsively spending. So I feel bad for criticizing their habits... but on the other hand, because SO comes from a wealthy background, I also feel that they have no concept of what it's like to budget. My SO has never had to penny-pinch or sacrifice to make ends meet. I came from a family that wasn't nearly as privileged, and regularly had to make money stretch from paycheck to paycheck.

Because of their habits, I'm completely in charge of our finances, and I hate it. SO begs me every day to eat out, or to ""treat ourselves"" because they worked hard or had a stressful day. I do empathize, but it's just not financially responsible for us. What really drives me crazy is when they beg to go out for food when we already have stuff at home. I'll even list the things we have, but they will insist that they just aren't hungry for those things. It makes me want to scream, ""So what?! Tough it out!"" But I never do. Sometimes I just give in because I'm tired of arguing about it every fucking day. 

Sometimes to make our money stretch until payday, I skip meals. My SO never does, and that makes me resent them, if I'm totally honest.

Because when I do suggest we be more frugal, they get really upset. They always say that, in the worst case scenario, their parents will send us money. I'm appreciative of the help they already give us, I don't want them to give us anymore. I really want us to stick it out for ourselves.

Ok now the story.

It all started when one day she wrote me a message if I could walk her dog. I love that dog he is very energetic and as I had some time on my hands I accepted and walked her dog. She didn't give any reasoning as why I should walk it, but I was okay with it.

The next time she did give reasoning and that was, her husband was working her daughter fell asleep and she didn't want to leave the daughter home alone. I got that and was again okay with it.

But now she figured out it would be okay if I just walked her dog like it's mine.

4 weeks ago she sent me another message and now I asked for reason. She didn't give any and I was dumb enough to walk her dog again. (I have keys from her home, so she doesn't have to be home when I pick her dog up).

Then when I told my mom about walking the dog and the time, my mom stopped. That day at the time I was walking her dog she was shopping and my mom met her in the shop.

I was kinda mad, but what would I do?

That happened again when she made me walk her dog while she was at the garden having a good time.

And again and again.

I was fooled 4 times, when I realised she is ""abusing me"". I don't really want to call it abuse just using me to walk her dog for her.

Alright okay maybe I can go with you, but I don't want to stay at your parents house for 3-4 months cause of the kids and I think it would be too much on your sick dad and your mom smokes in the home and that's too much for them. Then the next day talking about it again he says idk it could be a couple months maybe a year maybe two years and we would put our marriage on pause. 

Wait how did a couple weeks turn into a couple years?????? Marriage on pause???? Wtf 

I said I'll think about it. If I go I want to take at least one horse. He agrees. But I keep thinking on how bad I don't want to go. How much I hate it when I go down there. How miserable I am. How his mom is allowed to do whatever the fuck she wants with the kids cause she's his mom. How much his dad drinks. His bratty nephew who never wears clothes. How I would have no one (every time we go down there i become invisible and the girl who watches his kids.) 

He calls his mom to see how his dads follow up appointment went. No cancer just take these magic stomach pills and keep coming back so we can keep scoping your stomach. YAY FIL is fine! 

We talk about how close we were to him leaving and I say how I felt like he was abandoning us to run down there. 

He jumps down my throat calls me selfish and how dare I have those kinds of feelings his dad could have been dying. Now he hasn't talked to me at since that conversation.

11096,Asshole,"So this teacher (I will call him R) was new at my school this year. 

Immediately he tried to impose his own way of teaching and grading on us (the students) which was very different that anything we had ever experienced. You were expected to do things his way, and even if his was was wrong, which people pointed out to him, you were still expected to use it. R also took points off for scratch work that he didn't like, and tried to take off as many points as possible on the tests, quizzes, and homeworks. Every student he had with no exception was subjuct to this.

R also took forever to grade our assignments. We took a test the week before spring break, and got it back ~6 weeks later. He also refused to go over it with anyone. R never offered help outside of the classroom and was hostile whenever asked for extra help.

The administration took notice and we were informed that R was not coming back next year. Needless to say, we were overjoyed about this. Since the announcement, R completely checked out, he just wrote notes on the board, barely talked during class,and went to Disneyland instead of going to one of the review days for exams.

When they got in they started to comment that I have a large variety of certain things i.e. fountain pens, nice liquors, things i collect and display, several different animal skins, bones, turtle shells, watches etc. 

I made a (looking back on it now) somewhat dry joke and said ""If variety is the spice of life than I am Indian food"". They immediately stopped me and told me what I was saying was racist. I kind of laughed and offered the explanation ""that in my experience having lived with Indians and eating Indian food, it's just heavily spiced is all and i was making that comparison"" 

I love Indian food haha and anyone who's eaten it can testify that its has alot of spice right? My joke was bad but in my defense my jokes are always bad.

15077,Not the A-hole,"As per most reddit posts, this one has years of backstory but I'll do my damndest to keep under the character limit. My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. 

Last year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just ""took advantage"" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. 

I know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to ""work it out"" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. 


My dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me ""tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him"" and stuff like that. 

With that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side.

Also I wasn't told that my dog was sick until I had to put him down. He wasn't sick when I dropped him off. My parents wanted to cover him getting fixed because they did the same thing for my brother when he moved out. It has maybe been two weeks between the time I dropped him off and yesterday, he was perfectly fine and healthy. I am in agreement that I shouldn't have trusted them, and I won't from now on, this was a huge wake-up call for me. Thanks for the input everyone.


Hey guys, before I get into it this includes a situation that deals with abuse and animal death.

So it's been a few days since I had to put down my dachshund who was my childhood pet. He was only middle aged at this point and at the time was of sound mind up until his passing, but unfortunately had to be put down because he developed IVDD and at that point became paraplegic. It was extremely sad and traumatic for me so I am unsure if I am right to cut them off. This dog was super important to me and helped me cope with my parents abuse and neglect until I managed to leave the situation. I was so happy that my life was turning around and wanted to share it with my best friend in the whole world.

So I moved into a new apartment at the beginning of August and I planned to bring my dog with me. Unfortunately, he was struggling with potty training and needed to be fixed. My parents offered to fix this for me, which was entirely managed and paid for by them. Over the next few weeks I asked about the procedure but they continued to put it off, until my brother told me that my dog wasnt walking.

My parents promised to take him to the vet multiple times but never did. As soon as I was able to take off work I came down and brought him to the emergency Vet. It turns out a disk in his spine slipped and destroyed his spinal cord from the waist down. I was told that if they got to it sooner there would be a much better chance of him recovering but at this point it was a less than 10% chance. I decided to put him down because there was no way I could take care of a paraplegic animal while still holding down a job.

I know for certain that there where multiple cases where my parents could have fixed/prevented this. I know for a fact my little brother slept with him on a tall bed and was the most likely reason for his illness. they could have taken him to the vet but never did out of inconvenience.

17865,asshole,"So I'd been dating my girlfriend since September, coming up on four months this week. We've had problems in the past, and it's honestly been a pretty rocky relationship because we're horrible for each other and want different things out of life (she wants a successful career as a baker, I run a small business and am glad to break even and don't need fancy things, she wants a house and two kids and a white picket fence, I want to start and live in a music venue, she wants a husband with a 9 to 5 stable job, I want to produce peoples' music and am okay with being broke sometimes, she's asexual, I have a very high sex drive, etc). Honestly we've even taken a couple of breaks (never a good sign in a 3 month old relationship).

20045,Not the A-hole,"My 7 year old daughter’s doing virtual school in our living room recently. I heard her teacher address a girl named Kelly a few times, which stuck out to me because my daughter’s class is only about 15 kids and I know them all by this point in the year. 

A couple times more and I realized she was calling my daughter Kelly. My daughter’s name is Keeley, pronounced Kee-Lee. 

So after school was over I asked her if that had been happening all year in this teacher’s class and she said it had and it really annoyed her. I asked her why she hadn’t corrected the teacher if it annoyed her so much and she said she had repeatedly at the beginning of the year but the teacher kept calling her Kelly, so eventually she gave up on reminding her. 

I sent the teacher a quick email explaining the misunderstanding but got no response. This teacher teaches a special subject (think music, gym, art, or language), not just one grade level, so my daughter will be in her classes for the next several years, so we couldn’t just wait it out. And how moments like these are handled now will set the stage for how my kid deals with similar situations on her own in the working world. 

I encouraged my daughter to come to class early or stay late her again, thinking maybe she hadn’t heard or understood her last time, so a quiet one on one would be better.

She got to the class early and she told her very politely that her name was “Keeley like really, instead of Kelly like jelly” and that people often get it confused so she just wanted to clarify.

So class starts and sure enough she gets called Kelly again almost immediately. So there’s only so much self advocation a seven year old can be expected to do. I just walked over and said “Hi, this is *Keeley’s* Dad. Her’s name not Kelly. It’s Keeley. Hard E. Sorry for any confusion.” 

A few hours later I had an email in my inbox “inviting” my wife and I to a parent teacher conference with the vice principle. 

The long and short of the meeting ended up being the school feels that while the teacher probably should’ve learned her name, that the real problem is she feels I challenged her authority by correcting her in class and that the names were “similar enough” for it to “not have warranted such drastic action.”

That surprised me. I couldn’t believe a meeting was necessary, let alone that it cast blame on us.

\- Reach across the table and brush my hair out of my face while I was eating

Second, they have the ""Bible part."" This is the part where they talk about life, discuss the Bible, and pray. This part lasts about half an hour. This part of the Bible study affects me more than the ""Secret Hitler"" part. I grew up in the church, but don't have fond memories of it. When I hear them talking like people talked at Sunday school and youth group, it brings up a lot of bad emotions. It also makes me really uncomfortable to be in a room full of people essentially talking bad things about my choices (Leaving the church, not reading the Bible, ""living a life of sin"") even though the conversation isn't directed at me.

When I talked to him today, he essentially said tough luck to me if he can't find another spot, because he'd still host it in that case.

So, WIBTA if push the issue further and tell him he has to move the Bible study, regardless of whether he finds a new spot for it?

TL;DR

My roommate hosts a weekly Bible study in my apartment. It brings up bad memories for me because it reminds me of when I was a part of the church. WIBTA if I told him he can't host it here even if he doesn't find a new place for it?

 I met a guy in high school and we became close friends. We'd mostly play LoL together and he'd always criticize my gameplay (not in a constructive way). I told him to stop but he'd never listen and thought he was doing me good.  


 Last year of high school, i transferred to another school. After I got a girlfriend, he was pretty jealous of her. He accused me of 'forgetting him once i got myself a girl' It wasn't the case, i just didn't want to hang out with him as much as i used to because of his disrespectful acts towards me.  


 When we broke up at the end of the year, i bought a new computer because my old one had been broken for over a year. I saw him online, we started to chat and kinda got close again. This is when i mentioned i had broken up with my gf and was pretty bummed about it. He lashed out at me, screaming that he doesnt care because i've been ignoring him for a year. I stopped talking to him after that.  


 Then we started to talk due to some coincidence. He was in a band now, and invited me as a guest to their practice. I accepted but the place was in a part of town i've never been in before. He assured me that he knew the place and would help me find a way back.   


 After the practice, we decided to go get some beers but it's illegal to buy alcohol after 10 pm here. I went first and got my drinks, but then the cops arrived. I knew i'd be in trouble if i was caught, so i told them that i'd go to the beach and wait for them there.  


 While i was gone, one of the band members was caught and was taken to the station. Rest of the band went with him. While waiting at the beach, a friend of mine called and we talked for about 50 mins. Then i hung up to check on my friend who was in the station. Apparently, he gave me a call and i was busy, so they took a cab together to go home. He didn't text me or try to contact me in any other way. When i asked him how to get back, he just said i'd find a way and hung up.  


 It was past midnight at this point, so most of the public transport was closed. I had to walk for 45 mins to get to a line that still worked and went home. He texted me multiple times that night, but i didn't reply. The next day, he started texting me again. I just said that i would no longer be talking to him, he was no longer my friend and what he did last night was far worse. We haven't talked to each other in 1.5 years now.

My boyfriend (23M) and I (23F) are both from LA. We met there and have been dating for just over half a year now. I moved to Toronto, across the continent in Canada, for school just a short while ago.

My boyfriend has this idea that him visiting me is almost like a favour to me. He says that we should split the cost of flights 50/50 when we fly across the continent to see each other, but so far the only thing planned is him coming to see me twice this month.

I am a broke graduate student and he is significantly more well-off than I am. I have expressed before that I was feeling lonely, but I never specifically requested that he come to see me.

Today we had an argument because I said that I didn't want to pay for half his flights (800 USD, half = 400).

I (29m) have been dating my girlfriend (27f) for a year and a few months.  She moved in with me just about three weeks ago.  Honestly, since she's moved in I've been feeling a bit smothered. She's currently unemployed due to Covid and doesn't seem to be very aggressively looking for work and I feel like she sort of expects my attention all the time, and I feel like she's been scrutinizing me too much.

I'm an essential worker and recently was moved to overnights. Yesterday morning when I got home from work at a little after 7am she wasn't awake yet. I was a little too wound up from work to go straight to bed so I decided to pour myself a bourbon and sat down to find something mindless to watch on YouTube.  

My girlfriend got up maybe 15 or 20 minutes later and came into the living room where I was sitting. As I greeted her I saw her eyes narrow as she looked at the glass in front of me. ""Wait a minute,"" she said. ""You're actually *drinking*?""

""Yeah, so?"" I answered.

""It's morning. Who drinks first thing in the morning?"" 

I tried to explain to her that it wasn't ""first thing in the morning"" to me, that this was my evening time, and that just because I worked overnights didn't mean that I shouldn't be able to unwind after work with a drink like anyone else. But she just couldn't seem to get past that it was ""morning.""

Finally I'd had enough and told her that she needs to stop smothering me, that I'm a grown man and unless I'm doing something egregious that I shouldn't have to justify myself to her and that I don't need to her permission to have a drink. I told her that I was trying to relax and that if she was just going to give me a hard time to please just leave me alone.

She's been pretty quiet with me since. I know I hurt her feelings which I feel bad about, but I also think she was being unreasonable and somewhat controlling and that I wasn't wrong to tell her to knock it off. AITA?

Edit: Wow, this blew up. Thanks everyone. I have to say; I went all the way to the bottom just out of curiosity over the unpopular opinions and a couple in particular didn't deserve the downvotes.

12461,Asshole,"Throwaway account, mobile user alert. 

My husband and I have been married for 3 years, together for 8, having lived together for over 5 now, and I believe our marriage is a very healthy and happy one. Almost 3 years ago we bought our first house together. It is smaller than our shared condo that we were living in before, and during the moving process we were actively getting rid of many things to help downsize for our house. During some of this sorting, I found an old shoebox among his things. I opened it to see what was inside to determine if it would go in a “keep” box or a “donate” or “trash” box, and discovered it full of photos, memorabilia, etc. from an old high-school ex-girlfriend of his. I wasn’t immediately angry or upset, I’d been known to keep an ex-bf memory box or two, especially at that age, and asked him if he would be okay to discard of it.

He became defensive and initially refused to my surprise. He had no other reason for keeping it other than “I guess I forgot about it,” and he promised to get rid of it later, but not without first bringing up a box of mine as well. 

I have a shoebox full of things from an old boyfriend from college. This boyfriend and I dated for 3ish years, and it ended tragically when he passed away from injuries sustained in a car accident. His mother discarded most of his belongings very abruptly after his passing, and the few things I had I quickly locked away. His mother/family and I are no longer in contact for a few reasons. This shoebox is all I have remaining of him. I do not revisit the items in this box. I haven’t opened it in almost a decade now as its taped shut. I should also note that I have exactly zero other memory boxes from any other ex-relationships I’ve had.

Today while searching for something unrelated, I stumbled upon my husband’s ex-gf box again. Last I recall, my husband had promised to discard of it. But here it is, 2 years later still in our house. I don’t want to bring it up again because we’ve already argued about it but I feel very hurt that it’s still here. I do see his side of it, that he wants me to also get rid of my shoebox before he’ll get rid of his ex-girlfriend box. However to me, it’s not a comparable situation because he and his high school ex-gf broke up. She’s still out in the world, living her life and making new memories which they both chose to do over 15 years ago, whereas my college boyfriend is obviously not.

4704,No A-holes here,"Throwaway because I'm pretty sure I'm the asshole in the situation.

I dated ""Sara"" from 2014 to 2016 (just under 2 years total). Looking back on it, she was emotionally abusive, and absolutely manipulative. To keep things short: she treated me poorly and I was a doormat. I learned a ton from that experience, and have since reflected on that relationship as a period where I emerged with serious personal growth and  much more self respect.

The relationship ended when she cheated on me. She broke up with me, and I literally never saw her again. Immediately after the breakup, I blocked her on EVERYTHING, deleted pictures, etc. The relationship was a mess and that's how I decided to move on. I literally haven't even seen a picture of her since the day we broke up. 

So, fast forward to today, 3+ years since we broke up. I get a call from an unknown number. Normally I wouldn't answer, but I'm waiting to hear back from some job applications, so answered. To my surprise, it was Sara's mom. 

I was confused, but politely asked her why she was contacting me. She goes on to inform me that Sara was killed in a car accident a few days prior, and that she was letting me know. She said that Sara's funeral would be in a few days and told me where it is being held. 

I told her that I am so sorry for her loss. I offered my condolences, but told her I wouldn't be attending the funeral. She got very upset and asked me why. I told her that our relationship didn't end well, and that it felt inappropriate overall. 

Her mom got increasingly upset, and said that she was hoping I'd say a few words at her funeral. I was shocked. I asked if she knew why we had broken up. Apparently, Sara had told her family that I had gotten a job elsewhere and we ended things amicably, and that she thought we remained in touch. I informed her that we broke up because she had cheated on me, and that I hadn't spoken to her in years. I kept trying to end the call, but she was very upset and I felt horrible; she had just lost her daughter. I was very uncomfortable and said something I shouldn't have. After a minute or two more of back and forth, I said ""Look, I didn't have anything nice to say about her when she was alive, and I don't have anything nice to say about her now. I won't be attending."" 

I realize how insensitive that was, but I didn't know how else to convey what I was feeling. I'm not happy she's dead, I'd never wish that on anyone. But the fact of the matter is, her death didn't make me feel good or bad. It has no impact on my life at all.

12667,Asshole,"Throwaway in case anyone recognizes our situation. 

My boyfriend and I of 3 years are finally moving in together. We live in a really, really expensive city where rent can be exorbitant. I currently live in a smaller flat with 3 roommates and my bf lives close to the city center in a small flat he bought 2 years ago. 

We’ve decided that we’ll look for a new, larger place that’s just “ours” and my bf will sell his flat or rent it out (he hasn’t decided yet.) 

So right now we’re looking around but we can’t decide on a budget. For one, he earns 7x what I do (45k vs. ~300k) and can afford so much more in rent. I want to look at larger places that are far out of my price range ($800-1000) but he could easily afford ($4000-5000) because these are the only ones that are close to both of our work and large enough to live in comfortably with two people. However, he wants to look at cheaper flats that A) are affordable to me and B) would allow him to pay roughly the same as me. 

We had a fight recently where I said I’d like to look at more expensive flats and he asked me how I’d afford my share (he thinks I should pay 35-40% of rent). I said I’d like to pay what I’m paying now ($750) and he could make up the rest. He got upset at me even though it would still be a smaller share of his income. I feel guilty to asking him to pay more but I feel upset that he’d rather live in a smaller, shittier flat just so I “pay my equal share” than spend more so we could both be comfortable. AITA for the suggestion?

**edit:** sorry I got the math wrong, he wants me to contribute 35-40% not 25-30%. So our budget would be $2200 a month if I contribute the same as before ($750). This cost is essentially nothing to him though but I feel like he’s sticking to it for the principle which makes me feel really shitty.",458,441,0.84,AITA for wanting to move somewhere I can’t afford but my bf can?,bohjh1,2019-05-14 11:12:38,YTA,1819,AITA,"A couple is preparing to move in together after three years of dating but faces challenges in deciding on a budget for their new home.

6230,No A-holes here,"Just trying to put this throwaway to good use and I really enjoy this sub. It's quite cathartic. This happened last month. So for context, I work at a non-profit. It's been a little under a year since I've been here and it's not been that great. I'm a 24 year old brown dude in an office full of all white girls between the ages of 26-60, except the President, an old white dude who is barely ever in. This context is important because being in that kind of environment, I kind of walk on eggshells and mostly keep quiet. They joke about how quiet I am all the time.  

This could not be any farther from the truth. I don't want to sound like I'm humble bragging but I am a bit of a social butterfly. I'm very much an extrovert and that's just my personality that I don't really display much at work because I simply can't relate to any of them and just out of respect. I come in, put my headphones, knock out my tasks, contribute to anything I'm asked to, and then leave. I'm always a participant, I never exclude myself, I just don't talk much when I'm here because I don't exactly feel comfortable telling this office about my personal life. 

So I'm at a bar and I'm chatting up this girl and we're having a good time and I lean in and we start making out. We do this for about a minute till I stop, look at the girl, then hear ""Heyyyy, [my name]"". I turn around, and it's the other younger co-worker of mine (26F). She just asks in a really sarcastic manner ""how's your night goin?"" I politely say it's going good and make a sarcastic remark about how this is bad and I should leave. We both laughed, and I left. Thought that was it. 

The following Monday we have a staff meeting and the Prez is not there so I'm the only dude. The Chief of Staff asks how everyone's weekend is and we all say good. Then the co-worker I saw at the bar points to me and says she knows I had a good weekend. Everyone turns to me ooh-inh and ahh-ing asking what I did. I smile and just said I went out this weekend to which my co-worker replied, ""he was kissing on a pretty cute girl when I saw him"". They started to laugh, ooh, and ahh even more. I immediately responded to her by saying ""Nice one. Real cool of you."" She was like ""whaaat you're young. It's fine"" I just stayed silent and the COS shut it down pretty quick when she saw my face. The co-worker later had to give me a really uncomfortable apology to which I just stopped her in the middle of it and said no hard feelings just don't say stuff like that.  

When I tell this story to some of my boys, they start calling me an asshole for reacting that way and I shoulda just ""been a man about it"". I don't know what that means. I just don't want my personal life spouted out like that, especially around a bunch of girls. Another friend of mine said that at least now they don't think I'm some quiet kid who sits at home all day. I told him I could care less what they think, I'm there to do my work and leave.

I'm reading from my phone but after a while I look up and see the girl just staring me so I raise my eyebrow at her but she doesn't say anything, she just keeps staring at me like I disgust her. So finally I ask ""What's your problem?"" She says ""Could you maybe not sit there?""

A middle-aged lady scootches by and asks if anyone's sitting there, and I say no but the girl says ""Yeah, I am, but not if he's sitting there. He gives me the creeps,""

I say ""Woah lady, you got problems. If you don't wanna sit, other people do,"" but the other lady is too polite to ask so I just stare back at the girl. Another passenger, another middle-aged lady, asks me if it's okay to swap seats with me. I see what she's doing and decide fine, whatever.

As we both get up to swap, a dude quickly sits down in her spot. The older lady, seeing how I got jacked, got up and offered me back my spot, but I let it go. The dude quickly put on his head phones and pretended to sleep and I seriously fought the urge to just rip his ear buds out and tell him to get off (but I didn't because I'm a coward).

Meanwhile the girl finally sat down and is smirking at me so now I'm stuck standing for my hour-long commute home. So I tell the kind lady I changed my mind, and I'd like my seat back, which means now I'm sitting down next to the girl, who looks absolutely disgusted, and the poor, kind lady who tried to be a diplomat is now suffering because she tried to do the right thing. Since the dude who's pretending to sleep has his eyes closed, everyone just stares at me for screwing everything up.

I tell my friends about this and the girls say I should've just manned up and let it go. The guys say it's good that I stood up for myself instead of getting screwed over and just taking it. The girls say that by insisting on sitting next to that girl, I'm proving that I'm a creep. I tell them it's her problem to deal with. I was just sitting on the bus minding my own business, so if they think that's creepy, they can go screw themselves. Now the girls are calling me a creep and the guys and I just left.

so I'm 19f I turned 19 last week. 

my mum messaged me a few days before my birthday, she told me that she planned a birthday dinner for me. I was pretty excited untill I learnt what the location was, its 1 and a half hours on 4 buses, there is no way I can do that. I asked mum if I could pick the restuarant and she told me she had already booked it. 

when I asked for a ride mom agreed only if I got to hers, it's an hour by 2 buses and 30 minutes if she drove so it was kinda annoying. I told her I could not bus to hers or the dinner and told her to cancel everything. 
I said that we could do something at a restaurant closer to me but mum did not agree. 


she was not pleased and told me that I needed to be at the restaurant by 6pm, I never agreed to that.

When I got the email from them, I noticed there was a referral section. It said that I can refer friends to sign up for their loyalty program and get 25 points for each referral. Immediately I started to wonder how well it was made and if I could cheese the system. 

&nbsp; 

Clicking the ""refer a friend"" link takes me to a page where I fill out a first name and email for 5 friends. I make up random first names and emails using a disposable email generator, yopmail. I check the inbox of the first fake email I gave. There was an email from the pizza place that read ""Your friend John Doe invited you to sign up for your loyalty program"". I clicked the ""sign up"" link and all it asked for was a name and email. So, again, I wrote the random name and fake email to complete sign up. Then I instantly get an email to my personal email that said ""Thanks for referring Jane Doe. We credited your account with 25 points!"". I check the first email and it says I need 100 to redeem for a pizza. So I did this whole process twice, referring 10 total fake people. My account had 250 points, or 2.5 free pizzas. I feel like a champion. I can fuel my poor dietary habits for free?! I'm down!

I tell my girlfriend that we're having pizza again, and this time it's for free. She asks how, and I explain the whole thing. She starts telling me I'm an asshole for taking advantage of a broken referral system, especially a referral system for a small local pizza place. I told her it's a symbiotic thing; I help the pizza place by discovering flaws in their referral system, and they reward me with free pizza. Win-win. Am I the asshole?

edit: I did this last night. I haven't been doing it for months and redeemed hundreds of dollars of free pizza. One pizza, about $18 or so. They'll be fine. I can still call them and tell them about it. I haven't ruled it out. I know I'm still an AH though. Just thought this was worth adding.

When our turn came, I got clothes as usual but my wife got money instead. It's worth noting that my mom gave us our things separately, so that everyone would not see. When my wife asked her why she's giving her money, and not clothes, my mom said that since she figured they have different tastes (my mom figured out that the wife didn't like the clothes and that's why she wasn't wearing them), she didn't want to gift something my wife wouldn't like and felt that it's better if my wife gets something of her own choice.

I recently started my first year of college and obviously when I was dropped off there was a lot of hugging. I couldn’t hug her. When I go home for visits, I can sometimes force myself to do it, but not always. I feel bad because I know she’s trying to repair our relationship, and I feel like a total asshole for rejecting her.

He even bought me a figurine and a starter dice set (7 dice for $5).  

Last week, he gifted me a beautiful set of pure rose quartz dice, which costed $80 (7 dice for $80). I was in shock. I thanked him for the gift, but immediately asked him to return them.

Enter my sister 17F she has been trying to join the army and moved back in (she decided she was old enough to move out at 16 against my mothers wishes) while waiting to sign up. 

I've explained to her and my mom previously that when I'm working I need the courtesy of no profanity and an inside voice so as not to get into trouble with my job. This didn't really stop my sister from doing the exact opposite of what I asked. For example, multiple times shes been in the kitchen (which is down the hall from my office) and shouted to my mom about something that happened in her day saying things like ""THIS FUCKING GUY"" and ""IM TIRED OF THIS SHIT"". Everytime this happened ive always been on a call and a few of the attorneys I speak too heard it but where kind enough to not make any mention of it. Each time this has happened I've reiterated the importance being mindful of her language just during regular work hours and, each time I was blown off by both her and my mom saying things like ""you should go back to your office!"" (I cant due to covid limiting the amount of people that can be there) as well as ""put a blanket on the door to muffle the sound!"" (This also doesn't work i have tried it).

This has happened multiple times and each time I've reminded them I have to work from home and that ots very important to mind what they say. Each time i got the same sort of blow me off type response. Recently it happened again however usually my sister will say it in the kitchen where my odds are better that my work mic won't pick it up.

Obviously this caused a reaction on the attorneys part and I apologized profusely and did what he asked me at which point I clocked out opened my door and exploded on my family. 

The summary of what i said was me saying how I had asked multiple times for them to respect the fact Im working and to be mindful of it.

Everyone around us, including our parents, told us parenting was great, and that we were such strong people that we could do it. So, we decided to keep the baby. We had a beautiful little girl, and we loved her with all our hearts. 

However, we were 18 at the time. We had no money, were struggling to get jobs, and we had no idea how difficult a kid would be. Our parents turned sour once the baby was born, telling us we were stupid and they wouldn’t help us. After 7 months of struggling financially and mentally, we put our wonderful daughter up for adoption, and she was taken from us.

I don’t like to think or talk about this time. As you can imagine it was the worst thing in the world, I never have and never will go through anything worse, but we knew she deserved a better life than we could give her. The family did not want to tell her she was adopted until she was much older, so we haven’t seen or heard from our baby girl since then. We got through it together.

We are both 29 now. We both redid our A levels, went to uni, married at 24, and are now financially stable and own a house together. Last night I decided to ask her if she thought she wanted to have children with me.

It went 0-100 real quick. She screamed and she sobbed. She told me I was a horrible, horrible man and how could I even suggest having kids after what happened.

18231,Not the A-hole,"UPDATE: I got my mom to talk to my brother and his wife about the medical issue. My mom said that she will let me and my dad drive my little sister and her around until they get this thing diagnosed and a treatment figured out. Thanks for the feedback Reddit! 

In the past 12 years, my mom has passed out a total of 7 times. When she passes out, she slumps over losing all motor control and is out for around 10-15 seconds. The last time it happened, she passed out in the passenger seat while my dad was driving down the road, and then again a couple hours later while at a restaurant. 

She is going to the doctor for tests, but so far they don’t know what it is or what causes it. They’ve done all sorts of tests ranging from MRIs, an EKG, and are even talking about implanting a long term variant of a heart monitor. My point in telling you that is to be fair is to paint them in the appropriate light. They are taking this situation seriously and are doing the best they can to figure out what the problem is and how they can fix it. 

Last night, I got into an argument with both my parents. It started out with me expressing my concern for my mom and the reoccurring passing out. I then mentioned that she really shouldn’t be driving. I asked her what would happen if she passed out with my 8 year old sister in the car, or what if she passed out and ran into an innocent person. She basically responded and said, “How would you feel if someone tried to tell you that they were going to take your independence away from you?” My mom had admitted though that the doctor’s nurse had called her yesterday and told her that she shouldn’t be driving.

We then started talking about my brother’s one year old daughter. My mom said that if they told my brother that she was passing out randomly, they would stop letting her see their granddaughter. I told them that this was my brother’s decision to make, since it is his daughter, but that he at least had the right to know. 

My dad butted into the conversation and told me that he doesn’t like “busy bodies” that get in the middle of other peoples business, and that this was none of my business so I should stay out of it. 

This made me mad, because I am pretty close to my little sister and my brother’s family, and I know he would be absolutely pissed off if he found out she was holding this back from him. I told them both that they were being selfish, thinking only about the things that they would lose out on because of this problem (my mom’s independence and my brother refusing to let her watch their granddaughter). 

They continued to rationalize it, talking about how infrequently it has happened over the past 12 years. I ended up getting mad, giving up, and walking off. I feel awful.

John is not a citizen in America, so Jane has been explains the conventions of American engagement to him once they had agreed that they were ready to move forward with their relationship. I do not believe that they collectively receive a lot of money in income, as they are in their early 20s in college and working part time. She told him that the rule of thumb is that one would spend approximately 3 months salary on an engagement ring, but confessed that she doesn't need an expensive engagement ring. She guided his hand in the process, as John had requested that she show him what variety of ring she likes. Jane confided in some coworkers that he was struggling to understand her instructions with regards to the style of ring.

One week later, after having washed her hands she had noticed that the ring had contorted and had lost its form. Fortunately, John had a warranty on the ring so in no time she was wearing a ring again. Not too long after that, the new ring had lost its center diamond, and this compelled her to ask John how much the engagement ring had cost him. Evidently, he had only spent less than 200 dollars on the ring because he had thought that they all looked the same so he merely bought the cheapest one.

Jane was not pleased with this, though she had acknowledged that she told him to not spend a fortune on the ring, she thought that he could spend little more than 200 dollars considering he actively trying to buy a new car for himself, and a number of other things (that I cannot remember) much more costly than a 200 ring.

This summer I was hired by a family friend (let's call him Bob) to help out with his electrician business. I thought I'd be doing office work, but I'm actually on the field doing the work with him. I ended up loving the work and Bob loves having me. He offered to keep me hired during the school year and after I graduate I can officially start my apprenticeship with him. I told him yes. 
My parents at first weren't too thrilled. They always wanted me to go to university. But they changed their minds after I talked to them so more about it. I told them that electricians make good money and I wouldn't have to go to college for 4 years and spend $80k on a degree. They agreed with my decision.
But now they told my siblings and I that now they can using my college savings for my siblings' education. I have an older sister who just finished her sophomore year in college and a younger sister who just finished her sophomore year in high school. 
As far as I know the college savings for all 3 of us are in one bank account by my parents. My siblings and I haven't put any of our money into it (we each have our own general savings account). The college money is all from our parents that they saved up over the years. They said they have enough for 3 years of tuition and room and board for the 3 of us. I'm not sure on the exact amount, but by that estimate my share would be around $60k. 
I told my parents that it wasn't fair for them to give away that money to my siblings. My parents think I'm being selfish as now they'd be able to pay for all 4 years for my 2 sisters and still have some left over in case they want to go to grad school.

In recent months my brother's grades fell and he also gained weight due to puberty(or stress eating? I don’t know). My mother had been calling him “fat pig"" and “gross"" and the likes on any fault she found on him, and sometimes it resulted in a shouting match between them.


Me on the other hand, got spoilt intentionally in front of my brother to make him feel bad.

Whenever I asked mother why would she do that to him, she said that boys should be trained to be stronger, and he will learn to improve this way.

I'm bisexual, and I'm an atheist. However my parents rule is that I will be going to church as long as I live with them. I'm 16, have a job, and go along with whatever they want me to do as it keeps arguments to a minimum.

Recently I brought a rainbow bracelet to signify pride/support the movement. My parents don't seem to notice anything I wear or do, so I feel fine. However, last Sunday I went to church, and my small groups leader (an obnoxiously friendly and touchy woman) inquired about my bracelet. I just laughed it off- I felt awkward and didn't want to talk about it.

Later, when the service started, the pastor made a strange amount of eye contact with me as he went on the usual invitation, ""If any of you are struggling with any sins- any sin AT ALL, the youth leaders are here to talk to you, and will help you overcome this sin.""

I don't want to overcome anything. I don't want to overcome my girlfriend, or any of my LGBT friends, all of which are viewed as sinful by the church. Previously gay kids have been outed to their parents, the community, etc. At one point the pastor asked 'what is the most disgusting thing in God's eye?' and the adult pastor's son yelled out 'GAY PEOPLE'. The youth pastor's scrambling to correct the statement didn't make me feel any better about the church's stance.

After the service, I didn't come forward, and my small group leader approached me again, essentially telling me that she knows I struggle with same sex attraction and that the bracelet is a way of showing it. I didn't want to deal with the hassle, the arguments, the bullying- so I got manipulative. Really really manipulative. I started crying (something I can do easily on cue), asking her why she would accuse me of such a thing. I even started babbling like I couldn't articulate, and she took me to the next room to calm down, apologizing profusely. I then explained that the rainbow was God's promise to never flood the earth again, and I wear it as a reminder of his gracious promise. It was some churchy-Sunday school-John 3:16 bullshit I came up with on the spot, but she immediately backed down and apologized. The rest of the night I made a point of wiping my eyes, sniffling, generally send a message that I was not feeling well at all. Several of my peers cane up to me after that saying they were sorry that she said that to me, and that they knew I would never hide something as 'disgusting' as that from the rest of them.

And now I feel awful. I feel awful for pretending to be one thing. I feel like I'm disrespecting my community and I feel like I'm disrespecting the people I'm lying to. I've never had any problem lying and manipulating to keep myself safe but now I'm questioning my own character.

18507,No A-holes here,"I’ll try and keep the backstory as short and to the point as I can because I’m in a real turmoil at the moment. 

I was estranged from my dad until my mum died early last year. He came back into my life at her funeral. 
He lives in a different country from me with a family I haven’t seen or spoken to in years. 
He asked me if there was a way we could have a relationship. I was emotionally distraught after my mum died because she has no living family so I was in a sense on my own. I was working a shit job I hated so when the opportunity came to leave I said yes.

Living with him has been fine. He works a lot and we spend time together whenever we can. ‘My’ family have been very welcoming to me, inviting me out and helping me adjust to a new country and lifestyle.
After a few months I noticed my dad was unwell, gradually getting worse. I questioned him about it and he told me not to worry.  Then I found the letters from the hospital. 

The letter I found was from the hospital saying my dad had missed another chemo appointment for his cancer. I decided to confront him when he got home.

He sat at the kitchen table, smoking a cigarette, and told me he knew he had cancer and he knew that it was likely terminal and he wasn’t gonna spend whatever time he had left hooked up to machines on the off chance it worked. 

I’m not proud but I lost my shit. I had just lost my mother and to all extents and purposes I had no father. He comes back into my life to forge some kind of relationship with me to tell me I might have to watch my father die the same year I lost her. 

I told him he has to go to his chemotherapy or I’m leaving. 

Am I the asshole here?

*** 
I thought I would add on a bit to clarify any questions I didn’t originally cover. 

1) My dad was told that if he didn’t do the chemo he would last a year, maybe. If he did the chemo he could live another 10 years. My dad is 52.

2) Nobody knows about it apart from me. No one in my family or anyone at his job is aware of how ill he is. 

3) My mum moved to this country to be with my dad. When they divorced my mum wanted to go back to her country because my dad’s family ‘turned’ on her.

It's just a random YouTube guy that films nature audio and scenery, like rain falling or one if a snowy mountain wind sounds.

I noticed in his description that he asks for donations to his channel wich I thought was hilariously bad, like he's filming mountain streams on his hikes and expects money for that!?

Kelsie argued that she uses his videos to sleep every night as he has 24 7 live rain videos and a bunch of 12 hour audio stuff.

Then she dropped the real bomb, as I'm laughing at the guy for begging for money on the internet she says that she has donated $50 over the last 4 months to this fucking simp.

I asked her if shes speaking to the guy who makes the videos and she said not exactly, she said he emailed her thanking her for the donations the 2 times she donated, wich makes that a blatant lie.

emailing is talking too, she also attached notes to her donations wich I asked to see.

In the notes she thanks him for the videos and sings them praise for curing her chronic insomnia.

Kelsie has prescribed sleeping pills for insomia, she absolutely doesn't need to be spending money on this random guy on YouTube.

Shit hit the absolute fan anyway because kelsie must have called her dad to intervene and he called me and told me to fuck off away from kelsie and called me controlling.

16435,Everyone Sucks,"For about a year and a half, I had feelings for my friend from uni. We hung out a lot and did a lot of “couple things”, such as cuddle and hold hands and stuff, but never anything more. Anytime I would ask her out, she would decline and say she wasn’t looking for a relationship right now. Totally understandable.

A month and a half ago, I met another girl and immediately fell for her. We started a relationship. During this time, me and my friend stopped talking as much. We would still run into each other at school and say hey and occasionally text but nothing like before. 

About a week ago she waited for me at my car and confronted me, asking me why I was avoiding her and not treating her how I used to. I told her the truth, that I was in a relationship now. She said something like “I thought you liked me?” And I told her that I did, but she never seemed interested so I backed off and moved on. She seemed to accept it and that was that, but then she texted me later in the day that she liked me a lot and that she didn’t expect me to just give up on her, etc. She said I should at least give us a chance before being with someone else.

The other day, she texted me and invited me to go out with her and some friends, and when she told me who was going, it sounded like it was like a triple date kind of thing, with us being the third couple. Not wanting to be paired off with the girl who rejected me for a year and a half and only suddenly showed interest in me when I’m no longer available, I asked my girlfriend if she wanted to go out with me and some friends, she said sure, so I texted back my friend that I’d be there. 

Last night was the outing and I showed up with my girlfriend. My friend was left being the odd man out and spent the entire night being clearly upset. She spent the night being pissy while looking at her phone. She texted me in the middle of dinner “I didn’t think you’d bring her. I invited you, not her”, but I didn’t care. It was shitty of her to try to force us into a date-like situation when she knows I’m taken now. 

When we were in the car to leave, my girlfriend called the situation before I could even say anything, and said I was an asshole for dragging her into it. She said I should’ve just declined the invite and that she felt bad for my friend because I embarrassed her in front of her friends. I didn’t think she’d side with a girl who was actively trying to make me leave her but she did. 

I really liked my friend. For a year and a half and she never seemed interested in me the way I was in her, which is fine. But now that I have someone else, she suddenly has feelings and wants me. It’s super shitty on her part. But now she’s mad, and my girlfriend’s mad, and yeah, it would’ve been more mature just to not go, but I don’t think what I did was that bad.

14488,Everyone Sucks,"Last week i received an invitation to my cousin's wedding. It was addressed to me and my parents. I sent Cousin a letter explaining that i wasn't going, but my parents were excited to be there.

A few days later, she called me asking why i wasn't coming.

My cousin is extremely ani-children. Mocks them openly, ridicules people who choose to have them. I'm not the best with kid but i don't hate them. I find people who complain about children to be more obnoxious than the actual children.

As the invitation made it clear the wedding was 18+, i know the wedding is going to end up with Cousin getting drunk and mocking all the parents who couldn't attend due to lack of childcare and making jokes to the parents who DID make it about being 'free from your little demons for the night'. I don't want any part of that.

When she called, i told her i was happy for her, and she's welcome to have the wedding she wants, but i wasn't interested in going to a child free wedding.

In retrospect i should have lied and said i had class or something. But she put me on the spot and Im not good with confrontation. 

She got upset and started arguing with me. She said she wanted everyone together for her wedding and me missing it was ruining her day. I was being stuck up and judgmental at her decision and i dont get to say how she plans her wedding. 

I told her that was true, but she doesn't have a right to decide who accepts her invitations. And if she wanted all the family together, i thought it was pretty shitty to not include children as part of the family. Again, retrospectively, I should've shut up. 

She told me she was taking back my invitation (fine with me, saves me the present i was still going to send her) and was going to reconsider inviting my parents (less ok, they havent done anything to her). Then she hung up. 

I let my parents know what she said. They said that while she went a little overboard, i should've just RSVPd 'Yes' in the first place.

Since she called, there's been several passive aggressive Facebook/Twitter posts, and several other family members have called me trying to get me to reconsider.

I've told them all the same thing: Cousin is welcome to plan her wedding exactly how she wants it, i just won't be there. Still, everyone has been keeping up with it being me who's the problem. That i should put my opinions aside for family, that i shouldn't care because i don't have children, that i should never decline a wedding invitation because it's not about me it's about the couple, etc. 

Now, i know i was the asshole for telling Cousin that i disagreed with her having a child free wedding, even if i was confronted directly. And if i ever get the chance, I'll apologize for being so blunt with her during a stressful time.

21170,No A-holes here,"My ex husband desperately wanted a son. I call it a Henry VIII complex. We ended up having 3 girls. We divorced 5 years ago, and within 2 years he remarried and had a son, who is now 3, and a daughter, now 1. Our daughters are 10, 8, and 6.

There's consistently been a clear favouritism towards his son ever since he was born, something his second wife only noticed when they had their daughter. When she picked up on it, they split up. Before the split, my daughters described their weekends with dad as him focusing on their brother while they were babysat by their (now ex) stepmother.

We have almost identical custody agreements, with him getting every other weekend, but the weekends don't overlap at all, meaning the 2 sets of kids are never there at the same time. He's asked her to switch her weekends, but she's refused, so now he wants me to change mine so he has all 5 kids on the same weekends.

He presented it as a bonding thing, and they should be around their half siblings as much as possible in order to get the full sibling experience. However, he also mentioned that his mother could only come by 2 weekends a month (she lives a couple hours away and the kids love her but making the drive is always a hassle so they don't see her much). The mention of his mother makes me think that he might be planning on having her take care of the girls while he spends time with his son.

Because of this, I've refused to switch weekends. My ex says I'm being unreasonable, this works best for him, and he's the one dealing with 5 kids, he just wants to make sure all his kids have a relationship. I asked my boyfriend about it, as he has half siblings, and he sided with my ex, saying that he wishes his parents had done more to facilitate the relationship between them all early on. My hesitation is still that it sounds like he's planning on having his mother watch the girls while he spends time with his son, and I don't want my kids (or their half sister) pushed aside and if we kept the weekends how they are then he has to spend time with them in some form. I have brought this up with my ex husband before now, but he insists he loves all his kids equally and that I can't make statements about how much time he spends with each kid as I'm not actually there.

I think I might be TA because it's about the kids and it's better for the kids to have a good relationship with their half siblings, and the best way to facilitate that is for the kids to all be in the same place at the same time.

Ok so I got a house and it came with a hot tub. Awesome. Last owners didn't winterize it before moving out, less awesome. It leaks.

Call a repair company. Repair guy comes out a couple times, checks the things, fixes one thing, still leaks, comes back finds a cracked pipe. Still I'm 100% fine with this. Normal repair stuff.

The repair company then says, to fix the pipe we need to get underneath it and you'll have to get a bunch of guys to come over and stand it up on its side (these things are very heavy). Also, the room it's in might not be big enough to stand it up on its side so you might have to cut and replace a board to do this. Call us when it's done and we will come back and work on the tub again.

It was a pair of flowy nylon/spandex dark purple pants and I was wearing a red shirt with the pants.

After my appointment, I go to the grocery store to pick up food for dinner. I was looking in the freezer bin when this young woman about my age walks up and taps me on the shoulder. With the most condescending voice I have ever heard says “ You know purple and red don’t actually go together, right?” And I immediately shoot back with “you know I don’t give a shit, right?” She gives me a dirty look and says that she was just trying to help and then walks away.

2751,Asshole,"We have two daughters, Jody who is 26 and Hanna who is 28.

Both of them are engaged to two wonderful men who we adore.

My wife and I have saved roughly $50k for each daughter as a wedding fund. We aren't rich people so it took us years of being careful with our finances to help pay for half their college and this wedding fund.

We sat down with both my daughters separately to talk about their wedding plans. They did not know we had a fund for them. This was probably our first mistake.

Hanna immediately said she did not want a large wedding and would rather save money for a house deposit. She was going to do a courthouse wedding followed by a reception next year. So my wife and I agreed we would give her the wedding fund for that purpose. Again, we didn't communicate any of this with her. A huge mistake in hindsight.

Jody wanted a decent sized wedding. Something the fund would've covered.

My wife and I decided to pay for several of our family members from out of the country to attend. We knew it would be expensive but we knew we were only having one traditional wedding and we hadn't seen some close family close to 20 years.

Unfortunately, the costs started going out of control and we ended up taking $15K out of Hanna's wedding fund to cover the difference. At the time, we felt ok doing this because the extra costs of the wedding were due to our decisions, not Jody's.

The wedding happened a few weeks ago and it was perfect.

The problem now is that Hanna is aware we paid for most of her sister's wedding. She isn't aware about the costs and that we had to use some of her wedding fund.

A week after her sister's wedding, she came to us and said she changed her mind after seeing how beautiful it was. That she too wants a wedding like that with all of our extended family.

My wife and I had to tell her there was no way we could pay for all the extras again because we thought it'd be a once in a lifetime situation. We told her we'd be giving her around $35k for a house deposit and hosting her reception at our home.

Hanna had a complete meltdown and accused us of playing favorites. She left in tears.

She is now telling us she's too busy to meet for dinner or lunch when she used to drop by a few times a week.

This situation has now reached other members of our family who are chiming in.

This has been killing us. My wife told me we should just take the other $25k-30k from our savings to make this smooth over.

A part of me agrees but a larger part of me is angry that we have to mess with our retirement just because Hanna changed her mind. And I know part of her decision change is because of the constant competition our daughters have had growing up.

They never abused my brothers (both cis and straight) My parents were never abusive towards the dogs when I was living with them. (For two decades.) Also I wasn't told that my dog was sick until I had to put him down. He wasn't sick when I dropped him off. My parents wanted to cover him getting fixed because they did the same thing for my brother when he moved out. It has maybe been two weeks between the time I dropped him off and yesterday, he was perfectly fine and healthy. I am in agreement that I shouldn't have trusted them, and I won't from now on, this was a huge wake-up call for me. Thanks for the input everyone.


Hey guys, before I get into it this includes a situation that deals with abuse and animal death.

So it's been a few days since I had to put down my dachshund who was my childhood pet. He was only middle aged at this point and at the time was of sound mind up until his passing, but unfortunately had to be put down because he developed IVDD and at that point became paraplegic. It was extremely sad and traumatic for me so I am unsure if I am right to cut them off. This dog was super important to me and helped me cope with my parents abuse and neglect until I managed to leave the situation. I was so happy that my life was turning around and wanted to share it with my best friend in the whole world.

So I moved into a new apartment at the beginning of August and I planned to bring my dog with me. Unfortunately, he was struggling with potty training and needed to be fixed. My parents offered to fix this for me, which was entirely managed and paid for by them. Over the next few weeks I asked about the procedure but they continued to put it off, until my brother told me that my dog wasnt walking.

My parents promised to take him to the vet multiple times but never did. As soon as I was able to take off work I came down and brought him to the emergency Vet. It turns out a disk in his spine slipped and destroyed his spinal cord from the waist down. I was told that if they got to it sooner there would be a much better chance of him recovering but at this point it was a less than 10% chance. I decided to put him down because there was no way I could take care of a paraplegic animal while still holding down a job.

I know for certain that there where multiple cases where my parents could have fixed/prevented this. I know for a fact my little brother slept with him on a tall bed and was the most likely reason for his illness. they could have taken him to the vet but never did out of inconvenience.

Back around June my fiance and I returned to our old apartment one last time (after being home with our parents for a month) to pack up our stuff and move across country. We checked the mail right before we left and noticed that there was a package left in our mailbox, but it wasn't addressed to us. It wasn't even addressed to our apartment building. We were about to get in the uhaul for the drive so I figured I would just take it with me and we'd find a way to send it back once we got moved in to our new place.

Okay well I kind of forgot about it until recently, but I took it one day and tried to take it to a USPS blue box thinking I could write ""return to sender"" and send it that way. Of course the package didn't fit in there so that was a dead end. 

So this is where maybe I am the asshole. I decided to open the box to see if it's anything worth my time and effort to send back. And I wish I hadn't. It's a $150 knife. Like, somebody actually spent $150 on this knife that was never delivered to them...... Now I feel stuck because on the one hand that's a lot of money for a knife, but on the other hand it's not like it was like a gift from grandma before she died or something that is irreplaceable like that. It was obviously a company that sent the knife out so I imagine they probably would have received a replacement knife by now.

So, would I be the asshole if I just gave up trying to send this package back and kept it? I don't even want the knife it just seems like too much effort that I don't really have the time or desire to figure out.

Backstory.  My husband (41) and myself (36F) have been married for 6 years now.  He has a younger brother who is my age who is getting married this fall.   They aren’t particularly close as there is an age difference and they are two very different people.  No ill will.  Just no relationship.   BIL calls when he need something (literally without fail)  but otherwise it is all communication via text.  For example a text was sent along the lines of “hey bro, if you want to be one of my groomsmen, you can. Let me know.”  Yeah, um we are wedding-ed out.  No thanks.  We don’t feel the need to live up to the expectations of others when there is not a relationship the other 364 days of the year.   All for photos and the proper image being displayed.  We dislike the pomp and circumstance.  We are fine attending of course but that’s the extent of participation.   We will enjoy the time with the cousins as they are close.   

We already have an expensive flight not to mention the resort is $400 + per night..,plus use  of hard earned PTO.  Which we cherish like gold coins.   

Now details have very slowly been released.  It’s on a need-to-know basis despite questions having been asked.  

Today, it gets texted that my husband will walk their mother down the aisle.  FIL is present and available.  My husband walked my MIL down the aisle at our wedding.  

It’s BIL’s wedding and I thought proper etiquette is for the groom is do to this.  

My husband told BIL that he should escort their mother or their father should, but that he was escorting his wife - his date (me).  BIL protested.  Husband didn’t back down.

Are we the assholes? No one’s the asshole? Everyone’s the asshole? 

Note it is a wedding in the great outdoors.  No set religious aspect (all raised Catholic but no longer practicing).

Recently I received some money and decided I'd like to sell my current house and buy a ""forever home"" where I plan to live until I'm old. Hopefully that house will see my lodger leave and me get married again, kids etc. over the next few years.

Lodger has suggested she would like to move with me, which is great as I like having her around and the rental money is useful. But has now started making a lot of demands about features the new house ""must"" have or locations where it ""must"" be.

I’ve been doing interviews all week and I have a woman coming in tomorrow who I just realized was my high school ‘bully’ for lack of a better term. She has a different last name now so when I called her for an interview I didn’t realize who she was, and I only used my first name when I called her to set it up. I have been looking potential candidates up on LinkedIn and Facebook and when I found her profile I instantly recognized her. 

I was a year older than all the people in my grade because I started kindergarten late, not because I got held back or anything, but this girl told everyone it was because I was stupid and couldn’t pass my classes. She would also make fun of my hair and clothes and say I was going to die a virgin and stuff like that, and that my only friends were the anime characters I would draw (ok I did have a little bit of an anime phase but I didn’t like go over the top and do the Naruto run or anything and I got over it pretty quick, I just appreciated the artwork and still do). She also interrupted me while I was asking a girl to the prom and told her she could do better. Just dumb shit like that. 

It didn’t scar me for life or anything but she definitely made me feel like shit about myself a lot of the time and luckily I pretty much forgot about her once we all graduated and went off to college. I know she might have changed but I just don’t see myself working with and managing someone who was so rude to me all the time. 

And as tempting as it would be to have her come in and lord it over her during the interview that I’m not gonna hire her, I won’t do that because that’s petty and unprofessional.

3710,Asshole,"Hello good people, this question has bugged me for quite some time and a recent incident convinced me to come to this sub to get an answer. 

I live in the US and drive on the highway for 2-3 hours on trips quite often. I don't drive too high above the speed limit, I use my signal to change lanes, and I'm a defensive driver, so all in all I consider myself a relatively safe driver. If I'm on long stretches of highway, I typically get in the left most lane and set my cruise control to 10 miles above the speed limit (or what traffic is currently going) so I don't have to worry about switching lanes and keeping my foot on the pedal constantly for long periods of time as I get foot cramps really easily that are painful and annoying on long car rides. However, I realize that some people want to go faster than 10 miles over the speed limit, but I always figured going 80 mph in a 70 mph is a reasonable speed and there's usually an oppurtuntity for people to pass me in another lane. 

However, I was driving the other night on a trip and I did my usual thing. Things were fine for a while, but then a large truck came up right behind me and began tailing me. There were plenty of opportunities for the truck to get into another lane and get ahead of me, but it continued to tail me, getting dangerously close to me. Finally, the truck switched lanes, sped up, and then jumped back into my lane. They then proceeded to brake check me, forcing me to slow down. To prevent them from doing anything further, I changed lanes and slowed down to around 65 mph in a 70 mph zone on the highway. 

So Redditors, am I the asshole?",139,102,0.81,AITA for not getting over into the right-hand lane on the highway?,d7j9h6,2019-09-22 00:37:58,YTA,1626,AITA,"The author, a defensive driver who usually sets their cruise control to 10 mph over the speed limit for comfort on long highway trips, encountered a situation where a truck aggressively tailgated them despite opportunities to pass.

21913,Not the A-hole,"I’m 30 (m) and my girlfriend is 26 (f). Ever since I was in college, I grew a fascination for watches. I didn’t make much money while in college so I would spend money on watches around the 20-100 range at most. Once I graduated (in computer science) I got a nice job offer so I decided to spend my first couple paychecks on a nicer watch 4000 dollar range. 

I met my girlfriend and started dating her quickly around when I was 27. She’s a social worker so she’s making around 40k a year I’d say. I’m making around 130k. We decided to move in with each other and we rent an apartment together. We split the bills evenly for rent (place is not expensive) but I do generally pay for all our meals outside and do spend on random things like vacations for both of us since I do make more. 

Here’s our recent problem. I’ve wanted a watch that’s generally around the 12-15k range since I started working. When I mentioned it to my gf a couple months back she thought it was silly to spend so much. I ultimately decided to buy the watch two weeks ago. I was so happy when I got it so I wore it and kept it on for several days. We hung out at her friends place and had a bbq with ten people (we all wore masks and social distanced). A friend of hers noticed my watch and got super annoying and judgmental for me buying the watch (it’s a Rolex so everyone knows the name and think they are super expensive). They asked how much it was and my gf said it’s over 10k. A couple of her friends really seemed concerned that I just blew that much money on a watch. I made the mistake of blurting out that I have several more cheaper watches in the 5k range after one of her friends asked my gf why she’d allow me to spend so much. 

Once we got home, my gf started crying and screaming at me for embarrassing her at her friends place and asked my why I wore my watch there. I was confused. She said that everyone there makes around as much as her and obviously wearing such an expensive watch around them was tacky and snobbiness. I told her I disagree. I worked hard for where I’m at and this watch to me symbolizes the effort I put it. It’s personal for me. I don’t go around telling everyone about my watch. I asked her what was the difference since one of her friends there was engaged and had a diamond ring on. My gf had no answer and now we haven’t spoken for two days.

I can tell it nearly kills him to know that they have been conditioned by my mom to believe that he doesn’t love them. He doesn’t argue with her criticisms of him though(unless it is ever suggested he cares less about us than she does) and typically just takes the abuse.

A few weeks ago my 13 year old sister made an offhanded comment about my dad going on dates with other women while they were together  “breaking mom’s heart” while the 10 year old was also in the room.

So my husband (29M) and I (26M) have been married for almost 2 years, and since the moment my husband introduced me to his family, they have hated me because I used to bully his sister (26F).
For the sake of this post I will call her Liz.

Before I get into the events, I want to make it clear that I deeply regret my actions and am very ashamed of my behaviour. I am no longer the person I was back then.

Back when I was 13, I used to bully Liz who was 12/13 at the time. I made fun of her physical features, I used to call her a man due to her sideburns, call her fat and would often get my friends to join in. I know from the way I’m writing this, it may seem like I lack empathy but at the time my father died and mother married an abusive man. I was a very angry and bitter person and I took it all out on Liz, who didn’t deserve to be treated so badly. 

This carried on for 5/6 months until her father called the school to report me. I was very popular and had several people back me up and so the matter was dropped. I got away with the bullying but after being reported I did stop. However that didn’t stop other people from attacking her and she became an outcast in my school for being a snitch. She left the school shortly afterwards. My husband was attending a boarding school and so wasn’t there at the time. 

Now when my husband introduced me to his family, Liz recognized me. After our first meeting, his family gave him an ultimatum me or them. He knew my past and that I was a changed person so he picked me. They immediately cut him off, and kicked him out of the house and even took him out of the will.
His parents hate him, since they blame me for putting Liz through so much pain

In fact at our wedding not one single member of his family attended, which truly recked him. All his cousins, aunts and uncles want nothing do with him, since they see his actions as a betrayal against family.
 I have profusely apologized to Liz, many times but she told me she hopes I rot in hell. 

Anyways a few days ago, my husband was scrolling through Facebook and found out that Liz had gotten married and everyone from his family was there. My husband had a very close relationship with his sister, she was the first person he came out to, they loved each other very much.However, due to him being with to me, they haven’t spoken in almost 5 years. He tried to contact to his sister and instead got a very angry email telling him to f*** off. My husband has been trying to reconnect with his family for a very long time and after being rejected so many times, I got tired of seeing so hurt and told him that he should just give up and move on.

He’s been getting frustrated with me and said it’s his house too and he should be allowed to eat KFC without me telling him ‘no’. In fairness to him he’s respected the rule and I know for a fact he’s not snuck it in the house.

She does however occasionally buy groceries that we both use and picks up other small things to contribute to the apartment.

However, I still feel like this is my apartment and is still mainly my space instead of a totally shared space. We have this huge argument over whether the toilet seat should be placed down after use. Of course I understand that it's common courtesy to put the toilet seat down after you've used it, but part of me feels like this is still my space and as a guest it's rude to tell someone how to handle their apartment.

Occasionally I'll forget to put the toilet seat down and she sees it as a sign of disrespect and me not wanting to have her in my apartment, when in reality it is more due to absentmindedness. On the other hand, I'm beginning to resent her constantly telling me how I should operate and run my own apartment even though it's seen as ""common courtesy.""

On their weeks they barely spend time with the kids unless it’s the weekend, but the kids LOVE my ex and think their house is like a playground. I spend a lot of time with them and teach them so many things but it’s like my house is the boring, normal life house and ex’s house is the party house. The kids are 4, 6 and 10. 

For example, my ex hired two babysitters to take care of the kids while they’re at work. Except ex is paying extra to use Elsa and Anna impersonators instead of regular babysitters. 4 and 6 year olds LOVE frozen and always tell me about them. 

10 year old loves to play games. Ex I think has a big projector screen to play games on, so now my son is treating my TV like the downgraded version. He likes to invite his friends to play at ex’s house but not my house as much. 

Ex takes them to Disneyland roughly once a month. I can’t afford that. 

I mostly make meals for the family. Ex has a lot of food delivered, never properly learned to cook. The kids have asked me to order food from the places my ex likes but again, I can’t afford that. Once a week or so is fine but regularly spending $100 on the family’s meal is too much.

Lots of things like this. I had enough and sat the kids down to tell them the important thing in life is time together.  I told them that when ex pays for these things all the time that is not the way to a happy family and it’s better to have a parent who can be with you than a parent who is at work all the time.

I really appreciate everything she did, but She uses it against me like she’s done so much and I do nothing for her. She’s really condescending and she ignores me when I don’t go to church, If I don’t do something she likes she ignores me or just guilts me, or cries until I apologize, Every time I see her she says I’m not happy and I need to change. 

She has done a lot for me and I love her. We have some really great memories. But I feel it’s a really controlling relationship and she doesn’t like who I really am, only what she thinks I could be. 

I’ve tried talking to her but she always denies what she’s doing or saying she’s just misunderstood- Her intentions are good, therefore there should be no problem. End of conversation. So, I started distancing myself because I didn’t want her disappointment, and I just couldn’t be myself around her. I stopped calling and putting effort into the relationship. 

So a few months ago she came to visit and I told her I was done with the religion and said it was bullshit blah blah blah and basically told her I’m not talking to her until she quits her shit and treats me as an equal and stops trying to control me.

Reason this is so precious is because it’s the first big purchase I made on my own. I never dropped it, did anything to it, and I even didn’t use it when I had colds or when it was dark.

I was disappointed (I hoped that she would at least comfort me as it was something that was extremely precious to me). 

I went along and asked my dad anyways. He told me to bring the thing downstairs. I did. He asked for another thing that would help him solve the problem. I told him I tried that already and it didn’t work. He shouted at me to bring it, so I did, whimpering. He took the thing away from me.

I told him that I would prefer if he did that somewhere else, he said it was alright.

My husband and I have been married for 10 years, we have two kids, J (7M) and L (3F). Both the pregnancies and the process before them were extremely taxing on me both physically and mentally. I suffer from PCOS (Polycystic ovary syndrome) and with that comes fertility issues as well as higher risk of miscarriages. My husband is well aware of that.

&#x200B;

When we were trying to get pregnant for the first time I had to make use of fertility meds and ended up getting pregnant twice only to miscarry later. The first at 5 weeks and the second at 11 weeks. This took a hit on me but my husband was very supportive at the time and we decided to try again. That was when I got pregnant with J and I was scared for 33 weeks because I was thought I would miscarry him as well.

&#x200B;

2 years after that my husband asked if I wanted to have another baby, I said yes and we went through the same route. I used fertility meds and ended up getting pregnant only to miscarry. Except this time it was much harder for me because I was 19 weeks along and I was very much attached. I ended up having to go to a therapist after that. 

&#x200B;

After that I ended up getting pregnant on accident and that was when L was born, although I didn't have to go through the stress of trying and using meds, I was terrified though the entire pregnancy and had to go back to my therapist. I ended up staying with the therapist even after L was born because I was scared of developing Postpartum Depression. This was when things got a bit rocky between me and my husband, because he kept saying I was over exaggerating and that I didn't have a reason to worry since L came out just fine.

&#x200B;

We overcame that and were living our life just fine when in the beginning of this year my husband started asking me if I didn't want to have another kid. I told him that no, because of all the reasons I stated above. He seemed to accept my answer only to come back a few months later to ask me about this again.

13405,No A-holes here,"Now before I start this I know it sounds bad but I’ll try to explain.

So I’m 21(m) and my girlfriend is 21(f). I’m a full time university student studying engineering currently about 4 years in with 2 to go and working part time while she works full time. We are also living together and have been together for 2 years.

Recently she told me that she is pregnant, only a few weeks along now but it was a massive shock. We always use protection etc. so I can only assume it must have been a defective condom because I don’t believe she would be the type to cheat.

Anyway, I suggested abortion to her as an option since neither of us are financially in a position to raise a baby and I can’t speak for her but I’m definitely not in an emotional position to do so either. However, she refused to hear it saying it was immoral and illegal and murder etc. (it turns out she has been reading exclusively pro-life media about this for a while). Anyway in short she said refused to talk about it or even listen to me when I tried explaining how the situation wouldn’t work and instead said I should be supporting her instead of trying to change her mind. She also said she had already told her family and if I didn’t want it I should just leave. When I asked her about how it would work she basically said she expected me to drop my degree and the last 4 years of my life to support it.

I should also note that she has wanted a baby for a long time and has talked about it a lot over our relationship. I talked with her and got her to agree that we would try later when we older and both ready before but now I’m not sure if she just lied to me then when she agreed. Now she says she’s upset with this situation and scared but I’m pretty sure she’s lying again as outwardly she seems over the moon about everything and couldn’t be happier (this also makes me a little suspicious on the broken condom)

I don’t want to throw away my youth raising a child when I’m 21 but she won’t listen to me at all (a bunch of other people in her family have had children young as well and all are now single parents). I feel like my only remaining option is to do what she said and just leave. Tell her I can’t change her mind on abortion but if she wants to raise a child she will be doing it on her own because I’m not ready to do that at 21.

I just want to know WIBTA if I do this? Thanks reddit

EDIT:

Thanks for the comments so far. I think I should clarify a few things:

1. When I say leave I mean leave HER not completely abandon the child. What I would do is leave but still financially support what I can as well as help to look after it. 

2. We had discussed kids beforehand and both decided to wait until at least 28

3. I know I cannot force her to get an abortion nor would I want to. This decision is based on the fact that she didn’t even consult me about the decision and refuses to even discuss it with me, completely cutting me out of the decision making process. It’s also based on the fact that she basically laid out an ultimatum for me which was ‘drop out of school to support us with a full time job or two, or there’s the door.",448,682,0.93,WIBTA If I leave my pregnant girlfriend.,bjo40k,2019-05-01 23:34:26,NAH,3136,WIBTA,"A 21-year-old university student is faced with an unexpected pregnancy from his girlfriend, also 21, who is adamantly opposed to abortion despite their financial and emotional unpreparedness to raise a child.

Our friends kept telling me i didn't have to listen to him about not drinking.

I'm a bit of a lightweight and got a bit buzzed (the beer was going to be the last drink for me that evening) and planned on sticking with my friends until i sobered up a little and no longer felt like being there. When drinking my beer S took the glass out of my hands and told me to stop drinking because we were going to head home for the evening. We live an hour apart from each other.

I decided to finish drinking up my beer which greatly upset him and he kept being rude to me. He didn't let me have a choice because according to him i would just keep drinking which i shouldn't do because according to him i was shitfaced (i wasn't). My friends asked us why we were leaving and i answered truthully telling them that S was making me go home.

I called him the next day and we had a fight which to sum it up was me trying to explain to him that i'm an adult who can take care of herself and don't need him to make my decisions for me and him telling me that i'm obviously acting like a child and that i HAVE to promise him i'll stop drinking when he tells me to stop drinking.

Since piano is too expensive I got her an electronic keyboard and signed her up for 6 months of keyboard lessons. The deal I made with her was that she was not allowed to give it up before 6 months and to practice 20 minutes a day, she agreed without thinking.


It turned out just as I expected, she got bored of it after 2 months and asked to stop the lessons. Ofcourse I turned it down and reminded her about our deal. She then started to make excuses to skip practice from time to time, often requiring me to remind her to practice extra time to make up for the times she skipped.


There is an upcoming school trip for my daughter and she is looking forward to it, it is a 3 days 2 nights trip. I told her that she can only go if she cleared the keyboard practice time she skipped previously. I can give her a break by not counting in the 3 days school trip, but even so she still has to practice the keyboard 1 hour a day to clear them all before the date.


She threw a fit after I made it clear that if she could not clear the practice time, she would not be going.

After we'd been together for 2 years my mum and her dad started dating, and began to sabotage our relationship. In short, they didn't want us to get married because they wanted to get married, so they began to systematically manipulate and shame us into ending our relationship. Rachel and I did break up in year 2 of dating, partly due to their actions (I say partly because we know we had a choice in how to respond to it) but we got back together at their wedding 2 months later. It's been 4 years and Rachel and I are married with a son (age 3) and a daughter (1 month old).

When we told them Rachel was pregnant with our son they said that they'd appreciate if we didn't tell anyone from my mum or Rachel's dad's side of the family, and that they wouldn't be the ones to explain how they're related to the kids. They kept this attitude throughout Rachel's pregnancy. Because of this attitude, we didn't involve them in the pregnancy. When our son was born a few family members came to visit us and I got a call from my mother calling my son an embarrassment. So to this day my mum and Rachel's dad have never met our son.

Since we got back together Rachel and I significantly reduced the amount of time with our parents. We went from seeing them regularly to a text message on birthday/father and mother's day/Christmas, and we invited them to our wedding and our son's Christening, but they didn't come to either.

Because of this, we increased the amount of contact slightly, enough that we could check in on them and know the status of Rachel's father, but they still haven't met our son.

Now our daughter is born, Rachel's father and my mother have asked if they can meet the kids, preferably in person but they'd settle for a video call. Rachel and I are unsure because as far as I know my mother stands by what she said, and I don't know how they'll act around the kids. We responded saying that if they make even one comment about the marriage situation then they're back to not seeing the kids, and they replied that we can't expect them to not say anything about either marriage. We responded ""then this conversation is over"".

Since then we've been flooded with calls/texts/messages from not only my mum and Rachel's dad, but also my dad/stepmum and Rachel's mum/stepdad (all 4 of whom hate my mum and Rachel's dad) plus Rachel's brother and sister and my brother, all saying that they had no idea we hadn't let my mum and Rachel's dad meet our kids and stating that nearly 5 years is a long time to hold a grudge, especially as it ultimately worked out because despite their efforts we are now happily married with kids, who should be allowed to see all of their grandparents.

10991,Asshole,"So to set the stage I am a principal in a fairly.... corrupt part of Pennsylvania. If you’ve seen the documentary “kids for cash” than just know it’s somewhere around that area. So six years ago we had this student that I’ll call John. This boy was to be completely honest one of the most brilliant people I’ve ever met. I wholeheartedly believe if he had chosen a different path in life he would have been valedictorian. But John just loved doing bad shit. Smoking in the bathroom, showing up to school baked, calling teachers ungodly names, fist fighting, you name he probably did it. 

But honestly John wasn’t a bad kid. His family was judged extremely harshly, all of them felons, each parent in and out of jail. So he was treated like white trash by students and teachers alike. It’s understandable why he would act the way he would.

So it was half way through Johns tenth grade year when the superintendents son told John that he had been “fucking his crackwhore mom all night long”. John was 5’ 10” and 140 pounds soaking wet at 16 years old. Despite that I have genuinely never seen a worse beat down in my life. It took less than an hour for me to get a call from the super telling me to get rid of him.

I went along with it at the time not paying much thought to it. John was sent to the neighborhood reform school and from there to juvenile detention. Somewhere along the way he graduated high school early and joined the army. He’s still a very active part of the community while on leave and I actually introduced him to a school assembly where he spoke of how he turned his life around. I thought at the time that my part in his life had been what had straightened him up. I noticed he was short with me before and after his speech but thought nothing of it, figuring he was a man of few words.

Yesterday I saw him eating lunch with an old teacher of his that I remember him being particularly close to. I went up to them asking if I could join and then John pulled me aside.

He gave me a speech about how I was a key piece in what was ultimately some pretty messed up experiences in his life. I don’t remember too much of it except the words “The way you guys did me may have been standard, but it wasn’t right. So sincerely Jake (my first name which I thought was incredibly rude), go fuck yourself”.

I’m torn on whether what I did really was the tough love he needed or if he really could have been so much more if I had been there to stand up for him.

13514,Asshole,"My coworker saw my tattoo, asked me about it, and said it was cultural appropriation when I mentioned that I don’t practice the religion in question. 

I have a tattoo of a veve, which is a Voodoo symbol used to represent or summon Loas, which are Voodoo spirits. I got the tattoo because: 
-I spent five formative years in New Orleans and wanted to commemorate my love for the city with a tattoo. You see these symbols everywhere in New Orleans. 

- I’m obsessed with arcane symbols and consider myself somewhat of a collector of them. All six of my tattoos are symbols of this nature. 

- I love learning about different systems of belief that deal with unseen forces in our world. Researching and learning about them is a hobby. I also loved the story and lore of the Loa whose symbol I chose. I felt moved by it. 

I am an atheist and didn’t think getting this symbol was any different than getting a cross or ichthus tattoo.  I wouldn’t think twice about someone who wasn’t Christian having one of those tattoos for whatever reason. 

My coworker was joking around but it got me thinking. And maybe this is shallow, but it’s got me feeling a little self conscious, wondering how it makes me appear to other people. Would I feel differently about having this tattoo if I were in say- Haiti? I didn’t do any research about whether or not this would be acceptable for someone who did practice Voodoo. Am I being disrespectful or dismissive by treating this religion like a fantasy or fairytale that I might borrow a symbol from? I can still recognize the importance of a fairytale and it’s lessons and respect it even if I don’t believe it, I think? It’s got me thinking of cover ups for this tattoo.

1261,No A-holes here,"My nephew has never been an academic kid. He’s always loved working with his hands and hated sitting at a desk. 

He turned 16 and apparently went and dropped out of high school. He showed up at my shop where I work recently and asked for an apprenticeship. 

I was shocked to hear this news because his parents are both PhD university professors who feel very strongly about education, everyone in our family has at least a bachelors degree (I went to college and had a desk job for years before going back to trade school and I’ve never been happier than I am now.)

I told him he was welcome to have an apprenticeship if he went through all the channels anyone else would have to in order to earn one, then asked how his parents were feeling about all this and if he’d looked into GED classes and so forth. 

That’s how I found out his parents don’t know. I told him I couldn’t let him apprentice here without a parent signing a lot of waivers (true, even for blood relation) so he said he understood but asked I keep this to myself because he was going to tell them in his own way after he’d found a stable job so he could back up his explanation with a plan of action. 

I figure this is his life and whether or not I agree with his decision doesn’t matter, it isn’t my place to meddle.

I work 0700 to 1600, but most days I'm here till 1645ish finishing work up or just trying to avoid the traffic. I do not get paid a cent of overtime. 

&#x200B;

The incident happened last week. I was working all day, skipped my lunch break so I could make a conference call and keep working. I ended up staying to almost 1700 so we could finish the project that day instead of making it run into the next day. We finished around 1640±. 

&#x200B;

After finishing, I loaded up Reddit to just browse for a little bit before leaving as it was raining and I CBA to get wet walking to the subway. My boss walks past my desk and says (quite loudly) ""Ooh, I see, on Reddit, are we? We don't pay you to sit on Reddit at work"" this pissed me off, I had stayed late (unpaid) and was just chilling out for 5m.

21957,Asshole,"I have three children: Mary (23F), Fiona (19F) and Jacob (7M). My daughters are from my first marriage, Jacob is my husband's son.

Mary was always the responsible one. She had good grades and was very responsible with money. She worked from age 16 onwards every summer and after she graduated, she picked up a job that she held throughout university. I know for a fact that she saved most of the money, using it only for major purposes. I was always very proud of her for the fact that she could pay for everything herself and never asking for a single cent.

Fiona, on the other hand, was never good with money. She had several low paying jobs over the last few summers but spent everything she had on clothes or other accessoires she didn't really need. When she turned 18, I paid for her driver's licence. I also gave her an allowence of 20$ a week since she got a boyfriend, so she could occasionally pay for dates, etc. Fiona moved in with her boyfriend this January after we got into a pretty nasty fight. We have since made amends and she recieves 300$ a month from her father. Note, that I still occasionally pay for her expenses, for example for gas or some spare change so she can take out her boyfriend on dates. The works. Also, Fiona is still in school.

Mary is graduating university with a bachelor's degree. She told me that she could no longer work her job because the restrictions don't allow her workplace to employ her anymore. She approached me, asking if I could help her out with some money to pay for the extra driving lessons she had to take. I asked her how many extra lessons she had to pay for and she sheepishly admitted that she had to take six extra lessons. I was honestly shocked. One lesson costs 50$ and now she had to pay 300$. Plus, she doesn't even have her driver's licence yet. I flat out refused to give her any money towards that because her sister didn't need any extra lessons and drives just fine.

Mary teared up at this point. She said that she knew she shouldn't have asked me, that I had always favoured her sister, that I had never considered giving her some money towards major purchases which made her save up and never buy anything just for fun. She also said that she would give me the money back as soon as possible.

I must admit, I laughed at that. That made Mary mad and she started screaming at me which she never did. She further accused me of spending so much money on her sister even though she always blows it on useless stuff. I tried exlaining to her that most of the money I've given to Fiona was so she could invite her boyfriend on dates so he didn't have to pay for everything and that she didn't have a boyfriend until recently so she didn't need money.

I've always had a good relationship with my parents, and when I told them my gf was pregnant with my daughter 2 years ago, they were overjoyed. When my daughter was born, my dad looked at her like I've never seen him look at anyone. He was completely besotted.

Cut to three months later and my mum is diagnosed with cancer. It's a big thing, but we stay strong and we work through it.

A month after this, my mum finds out that my dad has been cheating on her. She came home one day and he was sat on the sofa covered in love bites.

He was actively looking - we found his online dating profile listing him as 'single', created a week after the diagnosis. He has decided to do this when my mum needed him the most, and then spent all of his time with this new woman, refusing to take my mum for her chemo or help around the house. He used the house like a hotel, stopping for food and sleep before he went back out with her.

Once he'd been caught he announced that this woman was the love of his life, and that he was excited to start his new life with his new family (she has two daughters). My sister was understandably angry as he's never really shown her much affection.

Since then he's become this horrible person, telling people that my mum was 'overexaggerating' the cancer for attention, and more.

9320,Everyone Sucks,"Hello all...

I inherited my grandmother's engagement ring. It's a rather plain ring with about a quarter carat center stone and two smaller stones, one on each side. I have two sons that I had offered the ring to, so they could propose to their future bride. My oldest declined and bought the ring he gave to my now daughter-in-law. My youngest declined when he married the mother of my granddaughter, who is a wonderful person and I lover her to pieces. After divorcing wife #1, he asked for the ring for wife #2. I have met #2, but I am not sure she is the right fit for my son. I reluctantly gave him the ring about 6 months ago. They got married the weekend before the Fourth, but never bothered to call me and tell me, either before or after the wedding.

I have been stewing over this for the past week. I have never been one to be angry at my children. At least not like I am right now. To give you some background, #2 is calling the shots in their relationship. She is doing exactly what their father's second wife did to me. My son does not call or text me. I received some very strongly worded text messages from ""him"" over Mother's Day, which ruined my day. (I found out from #1, #2 likes to take over his phone pretending she is him. #2 asked me to not have any contact with #1 because I should embrace his new family now.) He has not communicated with me in any meaningful way since hooking up with #2. She has taken control of his FB account, and has unfriended me for both my son and herself. Probably because she doesn't care for my political and religious stances. (She voted for the current occupant of the WH. Enough said.) Now they get married and never bother to tell me.

As a result of the actions above, I want to demand my grandmother's ring back. The ring means the world to me and represents family, love and devotion. (FYI, his dad and I were married on what would have been my grandparent's 50th wedding aaniversary.)  This woman who now wears this ring, does not imbue any of those qualities.

Their explanation was that the pizza place never responded to my order (which I presume would have been sent via text/call) and when they tried to call the shop repeatedly to get confirmation, there was no answer. This place gets insanely busy around dinner time and the lines can be slow, so I’m assuming they ignored or didn’t notice the calls or notifications.

When I cook things seem to work out fine, I cook the dish without the meat, serve it for her then add the meat in for myself. Or I just make 2 entirely different dishes.

I’m worried about just one thing though: my fiancé’s glasses. He has albinism and as a result is visually impaired (nystagmus or rapid uncontrolled eye movement, poor depth perception, visual acuity of 20/100 with glasses and 20/800 without, and extreme light sensitivity). I consider myself to be very supportive of his low vision and helpful when possible and I do love a man with glasses! I am very pro-glasses on the whole (I wear them too!).

Due to the lack of pigment in his eyes and skin, he has to wear transitions lenses to protect his eyes. I’ve for sure teased him about it but day-to-day it doesn’t tend to bother me. However, the more I think about it, the less I want him to look like he’s wearing sunglasses in our wedding and engagement photos. We’re having an outdoor ceremony, and even if it’s cloudy outside, his glasses will be slightly tinted no matter what. (Edit: the ceremony is going to be under half an hour right before sunset in December)

I’m thinking of asking him to buy a pair of Warby Parker glasses or something. He tends to gravitate towards more pricey frames (his current ones are Tom Ford) since glasses are essential to his ability to live a normal life — without glasses, he for sure could not get to or from work or read from a computer screen or piece of paper. I think that it would be perfectly acceptable to ask him to buy a pair of fashionable, but under $100 glasses WITHOUT transitions lenses for him to wear on our wedding day and for engagement photos.

4779,Not the A-hole,"Preface: I’m 20, but I have worked as a basketball coach since I was 15. I primarily teach the junior classes (ages 4-10). Some of our kids have special needs (like ADHD, epilepsy, autism, etc) and we work with these kids to help them all succeed. 

My cousin’s daughter Hanna is 8. Ever since she was 4-5, I’ve suspected that she’s on the spectrum. She’s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills. She’s never played well with other kids, and has meltdowns when her routines are disrupted. Recently, Hanna’s issues have been getting worse. After she uses the toilet, she refuses to clean herself, and makes her mom do it. She doesn’t shower on her own anymore. 

My cousin is very Catholic, and mental health is a taboo in our culture. She prays to God every day to make her daughter better, but afaik hasn’t done anything towards finding someone in the real world that can help Hanna. 

WIBTA if I told my cousin that I think her daughter is on the spectrum, and that I think she should get therapy?

a.) it’s possible that Hanna’s already in therapy and my cousin is just keeping mum about it
b.) I’m not a qualified mental health professional, and I don’t want to do an armchair diagnosis
c.) it doesn’t feel like it’s my business, as I am not Hanna’s parent

I told them them all that I had read on the internet that eating only apples was the healthiest thing for you. When I first told them they thought I was joking, but they underestimated how committed I would be to a joke. So, whenever in the presence of one of my friends (or friend-of-friends/coworkers/etc who knew them) I was very careful to only be seen eating apples or drinking apple juice/cider. 

Apples whole, apples diced, apple sauce, the inside of an apple pie, baked apples, candy apples with the chocolate shaved off, etc. 

Finally after about a week they bought that I had become an Appletarian. They started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. Some of them even got angry.

But I wanted to stick with the joke. Finally, after the end of 3 weeks, I walked into what I was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. 

They were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. Finally I started laughing hysterically. They were confused as hell so I told them I had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. I even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. 

I thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. My girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago I had ruined our date night when I told the waiter I only wanted apples because I was an Appletarian and had ""embarrassed her for a dumb joke"".

Within the past couple of months M has been making some really serious mistakes. Things like putting rent money into the wrong accounts, lost really important city inspection papers, amongst other things. 

M has been written up more than once, and our company has a 3 strike policy for write ups (write ups are only for large offenses and used only if an employee has already been warned about something).

We have a lot of shared interests: hiking, movies, road trips, and we occasionally disagree on certain things like any other couple. It never amounts to anything. 

However, she is vehemently against the recreational and/or medicinal use of cannabis. Personally, I think it's due to her having a strict adherence to the law that her VERY strict father taught her. She is the kind of person to drive BACK to Walmart and pay for an item if she doesn't find it on the receipt. 

I, on the other hand, have a long history of cannabis use that began with some trauma from my teenage years (in therapy, getting better every day). For years I smoked very regularly and worked at a cannabis-friendly job (I live in an illegal state next to a legal state) before I met Jane. I actually quit smoking for about our first 9 months of dating for my college internship. But last year after I finished College, I lost faith in my career options and returned to my previous pot-friendly job. Soon after, I was smoking pot again. I have now been smoking this entire past year. Usually it adds up to 60 dollars a month in expenses.

All the smoking has been done in secret. Which really makes me feel shitty. But I like to end my nights with some pot, I've never really thought that it hurts anyone. I smoke with a high quality air filter that basically neutralizes the dank pretty quickly; also I've started using a vape pen recently, which has no smell. 

Usually I smoke when she takes a nap, I get home from work (in my car with filter), she's at the gym, or when I walk the dog. I put in some eye drops to get the dry eye fixed and I'm good to go. She doesn't know the wiser because I'm not getting torched and acting stupid, and I get to relax a bit and let some anxiety go. 

Is this bad? I love Jane, and I know I'm lying to her by not telling her, but I really feel like cannabis isn't just something people use to get high, it really does help me. Only my therapist knows, and I don't plan on telling anyone else.

In the middle of January my wife's family moved into the basement when their former home was condemned and their temporary housing ran out. The family consists of Mom (50s), Dad (50s), three brothers (from 19 to late 20s) and her trans sister (mid-30s) The only source of income for the entire family is dad's military pension.  Besides Dad, the only one who has any work history is the eldest. She sold cell phones for an electronics retailer for about a year, however it is now several years since she has worked.   


My basement is finished, has a second kitchen, but no bathroom, so we must share the only bathroom in the house which is on the second floor. There are many trips through our family room to go upstairs. Cleanliness has been an issue as well, there have been several times that I've found urine and feces on/around the toilet.

9771,Asshole,"I started a job for the summer a few weeks ago, and I commute each morning via bus. I always take the same bus at the same time and it's always been ""on-time"" at least within a 1-2 minute  window. Yesterday, I was waiting at the bus stop and checking an app that lets me know when the next bus will be here, and the time jumped from 2min away to 6min away (which is not unusual because the app is pretty unreliable). I thought that was a little suspicious but I wasn't too concerned because a 4 min delay would still let me get to work on time.

Anyways, the bus driver ends up being 9min late (which is hilarious, since the bus comes around every 10min so the next bus would be there in the next minute or so). I thought to myself that maybe there was a small issue that explained why the bus was held up for so long, but I didn't think much of it until the bus driver started driving: And I realized the driver was incredibly slow, going about a 1/3 of the speed that previous bus drivers have/cars around us were (below the speed limit). In addition, he wouldn't leave a stop until everyone who had boarded the bus was seated (which I understand is appropriate for some passengers, e.g. elderly, disabled, young kids). Midway through the ride, I realized if this driver kept his pace, I would be uncomfortably late for work, and so I went up to him and told him, ""Sir, do you mind driving a little more quickly? My work day starts at 8."" I said it with a smile and tried to say it in a calm/friendly way because I know it was selfish and I didn't want to sound high-brow/arrogant  (but I was pretty anxious so I'm not sure how it sounded). After I said that, the driver just shot me a glare and told me to get seated.

This normally is never an issue, because the bus always gets to the stop near my workplace at least 10 minutes before 8, but with this driver's pace, I would be uncharacteristically late. So what normally is a 12-15min bus ride ended up taking a whopping 25min which I've never experienced in my 3 weeks of commuting to work. In addition, the usual rotation of bus drivers always drive uncomfortably fast (but within the speed limit), to the point that I always have to grab a rail as soon as they take off or else I'll fall to the ground.

Yes, I understand that this is one experience in a whole lifetime/planet of human experiences, so me being worried about being late to work is inconsequential in the long-run; and yes, I'm aware that unfortunate things happen sometimes outside of our control. But because I don't want to develop a bad reputation in my office since I'm still starting out/in my probationary period, being on-time is important; and usually, I'm hit with a wall of work from my manager once I walk into the office, so being there on-time allows the rest of the office to function (in some way).

AITA for making this request?

tl;dr Bus driver drives unexpectedly slow, so I asked him to speed up.

EDIT: I've taken this same bus at the same time to work since my first day and it always gets me there 10-15min before my work day. This day was a random occurrence where I took the same bus at the same time and ended up being late.

1684,No A-holes here,"My younger sister and I have never been close, until recently. I’ve been driving home from college to take her to the movies, or out for dinner, or what have you, nearly every weekend now. I really love spending time with her, and I’m glad we’re friends now. 

I have a hard time connecting with others. So to help us become closer as sisters, I’ve been showing her my music and movies and other interests. 

We used to be completely opposite. She dressed super preppy and bright, and I’ve always dressed very dark and “grungy.” An important thing to note is that she made fun of my appearance and interests before now. 

Ever since we started hanging out, she’s been emulating every aspect of my personality and appearance. She even went out and bought the exact same outfit I have, that she’d NEVER wear two months ago. 

She restarted her social media, and is now using my exact same filter and even poses exactly like me. If I wasn’t worried about anonymity, I’d show you a photo where she literally copied everything (location, lighting, outfit) down to my facial expression in her new profile picture. 

She’s abandoned all of her former interests. It’s not like was just inspired by or genuinely liked a few of the things I’ve showed her. She doesn’t listen to any of the old artists she used to, she doesn’t watch her favorite shows and movies anymore, she doesn’t wear any of her favorite clothes. She’ll ONLY do the things I do. 

I’m worried for her, too. At her age, I was extremely depressed. I had no friends at all in high school, not even a best friend. She’s always been a very popular girl with lots of friends. Her biggest dream this year was to be on prom court. Her sweet 16 had at least 50 people present. Now, she doesn’t talk to her friends anymore and thinks prom is dumb. She’ll go in the library and eat by herself, EXACTLY like I used to. At first I was afraid that she was becoming depressed like I was, but she didn’t know any of this until I told her. I swear, the next school day she had, she drastically changed her social habits. 

I have issues having to do with my identity and control. I don’t want pity or to excuse anything, but it might be important context. I feel the need to have ultimate control over my environment and identity so as to not dissociate. 

This is causing me actual distress, as nothing bothers me more than someone taking aspects of my personality that I’ve carefully curated just for my own personal sense of security. 

Also, this causes me distress because I am a terrible role model. I’m extremely sad and toxic, and she has always been a walking ball of sunshine and light. I feel like I’ve ruined her. 

TLDR; My sister and I were opposites, until I started actually becoming close with her. Now, she’s a mini me and it makes me anxious, as not only do I feel like she’s infringing on my sense of self, but I feel like I’ve passed on negative facets of my personality onto her. I don’t want her to end up like me.",71,338,0.92,WIBTA if I [19F] told my younger sister [16F] to stop stealing every aspect of my life?,dm04fd,2019-10-23 14:30:24,NAH,2980,WIBTA,"The author has recently developed a closer relationship with her younger sister, spending more time together and sharing interests.

970,Not the A-hole,"I work in a desk clump. (For those who haven’t had a desk job, imagine the Phyllis, Stanley, Andy arrangement. We look exactly like that.) 

My coworker has recently started intermittent fasting. I don’t know the specifics of how long she goes without eating but she comes into work not having eaten and then doesn’t eat at all during the work day. 

When she started intermittent fasting, she asked us not to eat at our desks. I figured she meant like no mindless snacking, no leaving a candy bowl out, etc. that’s not a problem because I only eat lunch at my desk. 

I usually eat lunch at my desk. Always have. So I started to eat my food (not pungent or offensive, just a turkey sandwich) and she said “Hey I kind of thought we’d agreed this would be a food free space.” And I said “well it’s lunchtime, I didn’t realize this extended to that. How many days a week?” “All the days.” 

I said “Well I’ll be fast and discreet. I didn’t understand the earlier terms meant no lunch at my desk every day, sorry.” She asked why I couldn’t eat lunch in the break room and I said “Well I can one or two days a week but I prefer to eat at my desk.”

She continued to bother me about it for a few days and finally got a doctors note saying she needed to intermittent fast and gave it to the company who have now specifically requested I not eat at my desk to protect us from liability. 

The other person in our clump already ate lunch in the break room so this doesn’t really affect them. 

Would I be an asshole if I push back on this? It seems absurd I can’t eat at my own desk at my own job but every time I sit down to draft a letter to that affect I start to worry I’m being an asshole.

*Edit to add: It’s been suggest I expand on why I’m opposed to the break room.

14992,Asshole,"Don't attack me yet, just read my post reader. So this happened earlier today and I just wanted some advice. This is really my first time actually posting something Reddit, so forgive me if I have the formatting wrong (on mobile)

So this happened earlier today after I had gone on the bus to go home today (I am currently a junior in highschool) and one of my close friends (also a junior) who I have known pretty much my whole life (we will call her C for this story) sat down next to me. We gave the usual greetings and she got on her phone. A few minutes pass by and she turns to me and shows me a picture of an old friend from elementary school (our friend Z who is a senior) and this is how the interaction went:

C: “Do you remember who this is?”

I look at the photo and say, “No I don't remember”

C: “Remember Z?”

Me: “Yeah, I do, is that her?” 

C: “Yea, it is, and I'm upset about this picture”

The photo she showed me has Z in a pretty sparkeled silver dress, and her mom standing directly behind her holding her waist, wearing a very similar dress.

Me: “What makes you so angry about this photo?”

C: “She gets to take a senior photo with her mom”

Here we go

Me: “So what about it?”

C: “It's unfair how she gets to take a senior photo with her mom and I can't”

Me: “It's not unfair, and you're not the only one without a mom”

C: “Well you have a step mom, I don't” 

Now I wasn't referring to myself when I said she's not the only one without a mom, my parents divorced when I was 5 and consider my step mom as my actual mom

Me: “That's not what I was referring to when I said that. I just know that there are other people who don't have a mom, and sometimes don't even have both parents to take a senior photo with”

C just looked at me in (disbelief?) And shoved her earbuds in and hasn't talked to me since. 

Her mother died when she was only 8 years old, and I understand how hard it is for someone to lose a loved one at that young of an age, but she is 18 now. It's been 10 years since then and she still hasn't gotten over it, so I ask Reddit, Am I The Asshole?

6003,No A-holes here,"I've seen a lot of narc mom validation posts on here...and I hope this isn't one.

I had my twins when I was 17. I dropped out of school and moved in with a friend who was helping me support them-no rent. I got a job, earned my GED, and over the next few years I started college and got another job to pay for it. For most of their early childhood, I worked two or three jobs and took classes at a community college. Some bad events took place at my friend's house and I was forced to move into an apartment. Good news? A classmate with a boy my girls' age was looking for a place, so we became roommates and kinda co-parents. Worked great, we lived together until I was almost out of uni.

Still working two jobs, I usually had night and early morning shifts and she had day shifts. Someone was always with the kids, and when she started working more we got a babysitter. At this point we were still very poor-we wore bras and underwear with holes in them because we didn't have money for new ones. She got engaged, moved in with the guy, and I was forced to find a cheaper apartment I could make on my own. I graduated, got work as a bookkeeper in a legal office, and started earning enough to confidently stay afloat and afford a reliable babysitter. We stayed in the apartment until my kids had moved out and I saved enough to move to a house in a small town (years later).

Now, my girls are posting mean spirited comments on FB and complementing each other. One will post something about 'I didn't know how poor I was until I realized how big a yard can be' and the other one will say 'I always knew, other kids with competent mothers had huge backyards and we had an apartment'. Complaining about yards, being 'raised by babysitters', always moving...I got sick of it. I replied on one of their posts saying they always had a safe home with food and at least one adult around to protect them which is more than other children and they shouldn't be whining like this when they were competently cared for. My daughter deleted it, and some friends have pointed out that growing up poor still isn't easy and they were likely bullied and felt some uncertainty for the future. I've been told a good mother would let them vent now so they can come to terms with their past. While I see the reason, I also feel calling me incompetent as a mother is mean and uncalled for.

Edit: I should have put this in long before now, but the ""bad events"" at my friend's place had nothing to do with my kids. My friend's parents had serious health and financial problems and could no longer house me for free. The rent they needed to supplement lost income was too high, so I had to leave so they could rent to someone else.

Also, thanks to everyone who left advice. I was expecting a lot of YTA, but I was surprised by the direction they're taking. It's opening my eyes to this, and I know I have to actually talk to my children about this. I'll try and handle it better than I have so far.

It's been a rough year. She had a lot of mental health issues, and ended up dropping out of high school and attending a full time therapy program. She finished the program, but got little out of it. She now stays in bed 24/7 watching Netflix and smoking weed all day.

Her dad and I have been trying really hard to get her to do basically anything. We enrolled her in online school. She lied about doing her work, and got kicked out. We signed her up for community college classes, she didn't go. I helped her get a job at my work, and she got fired before she started for not filling out the paperwork.

I guess she got tired of us pressuring her, and she waited for us to leave for work, and she packed her bags and flew to her mom's house. Evidentally they have been planning this for months. I am not sure why they didn't just tell us, because we wouldn't have been mad. We were planning on talking to her mom to see if she thought she'd do better there. Instead they said nothing and we were worried sick because we had no idea where she was. They actually did this once before. She lived with us for a few years and went for a visit to her mom's, and never came back. Her mom moved and wouldn't give us the new address for over 6 months.

When her dad texted her a few days ago, she said everything is his fault and she's done talking to him forever. Honestly, he has done so much for her. He has always been there for her, so he is super hurt by this.

Throwaway because I am active in other communities and I don't want this to mix.

So I was supposed to get married 2 moths ago to my ex partner of 5 years. Sadly we broke it off because he cheated on me on his bachelor party with a striper.

I had this beautiful dress that cost me arround 2k dollars (out of my pocket). I had been very depressed since everything happened because I felt it was somehow my fault for not being sexy enough or not giving him what he wanted. So last weekend I decided to ""take my power back"" and I began altering the dress. I have been sewing for 15 plus years so I know what I am doing. I cut it a bit, changed the color to something less wedding-y and after a week of work I had a beautiful gown that I could use for more stuff.

The problem comes now. I uploaded that picture of the dress to Instagram with a caption that said something along the lines of "" you can change the worst memories"" or some shit like that.

My sister hits me up and asks me if that was my old wedding dress and I told her yes. She then called me and asked me why I had done this. I asked her why it was such a big deal. And she told me that I could have waited till after he wedding. I was so confused. Then she reminded me that when we were staying at the hotel where my wedding was supposed to happen my mom and sister where there cheering me up and my sister said something along the lines of ""oh well if you are not using it i will"".

I’m a young (22M) guy who loves to dance and go clubbing. At these clubs and dance floors, they get really loud and crowded and frequently you have to “lightly” push your way through to get through the crowd. 

When I’m trying to get through women, I generally put my hand on the small of their back and push from there. I do this because I feel like its gives me good leverage to get them out of my way and quickly and as smoothly as possible. I stay well clear of the girl’s ass and never have my hand there longer than I need to. If the girl is wearing a crop top or something where I would be touching her skin, than I try to put my hand higher if there’s fabric cuz I’m not trying to touch some stranger’s bare back. 

I would do this to men too honestly, however I’m bi and live in a conservative area and am extra paranoid about provoking a guy into a fight cuz he thought I was hitting on him. So I usually push them with my forearm and a much more aggressive to get through. 

Recently I was talking about this and a good friend of mine, told me that this was shitty of me and that girl’s don’t like being touched there at all. I have seen myself as benign cuz I’m just putting hand there to move them, and I’m not trying to “cop a feel”, I’m just trying  get to dance. But I want to know what y’all think cuz I would hate to make people uncomfortable, I’ve been sexually harassed myself and it was not a good time and would hate to be doing that to other people inadvertently. 

AITA?

Edit: I’m the asshole. Thank you everyone for the tough love. I’m going to adjust by just lightly pushing people in the upper back with my forearm, because in these dance floor’s you need to kinda push to move, and I don’t want to spill people’s drinks which can happen easily with touching a shoulder.",194,401,0.87,AITA for putting my hands on the small of girl’s backs?,dcd5b4,2019-10-02 17:08:02,YTA,1799,AITA,"A 22-year-old man who enjoys dancing and clubbing has been using his hand on the small of women's backs to navigate through crowded dance floors, believing it's a benign way to get around.

Last night I reminded my DH that he needed to pick up our son from school because I have an event today-an event that goes til midnight.

We go to bed late and he’s trying to get something started. It’s been a couple days, but I’m just not feeling it. Not in a bad way, I’m just really content with the day and for the life of me cannot think my way into sexy time right then. I told him we could have sex if he was determined, but that I wasn’t in the mood. I feel bad for turning him down, but I got really cuddly which he loves. 

This morning it’s pitch black out and I can tell DH is trying to get some sexy time started again. He keeps moving me around to cuddle closer and tries to kiss my neck and such. He also keeps pulling the blanket off my butt and I’m freezing to death. I’m clearly trying to sleep and roll over to signal, not now, buddy. After almost 40 mins he’s like “okay, gotta go, last cuddle!” Right as my alarm goes off. So I yelled “I just want to sleep damn it!”  Right as he goes in for a last hug. He says “fine!” And gets up. I hit snooze. 

Not two minutes later our son (3years old) starts whining in my face about how daddy left and he wants his TV (he gets 30 mins before school so I can get dressed). I’m furious and call DH and tell him next time he refuses to let me sleep, at least take a minute to take care of the kid.

19397,Not the A-hole,"Hi. I'm 19 years old and a woman. I work in the family business furniture shop. I sell the furniture to the public, so that's like greeting customers and giving people their change, stuff like that. 

A few days ago my boss sent me on a delivery job. I was supposed to just ride in the truck with the driver to the place we're delivering too, then help unload this 3 piece living room set. Because of the type of work I do even though it gets hot I need to be covered up, so I always go into work with some kind of short sleeve t shirt or a hoodie and long bottoms, either leggings or jeans or overalls. 

The driver is my bosses step father and I've known him since I was a kid. He's been working with the furniture store doing extra jobs around the shop since he lost his old job. I thought he was a pretty cool dude. The drive there was fine, we were making jokes and listening to the radio, the furniture hand off went well enough. Then he pulled over the truck and he started up a weird line of conversation with me.  

Basically he told me about how well we've been getting on and how I look like a woman now and how much I remind him of my mom. I thought this was gonna be a super awkward attaboy about school and work and all that. But then he started talking about how he really likes me and we should be romantic with each other but it needs to be a secret because his family would be really upset with him if he was found out to be dating a teenager.

I did not like it and I felt really awkward and like I maybe did something to cause it. But after that I went quiet on the rest of the 4 hour drive, while he told me over and over again not to tell his step daughter and asking me if I was alright. Once we got to the shop and we were alone I told his step daughters husband. 

The next day they wanted me to go on another delivery with the guy and I pulled the most obvious fake sick call I could imagine. I didn't want to but I thought telling someone would mean I didn't have to work with him again, like they'd try to keep us separate and not in a truck together for 9 hours alone.

 I live with my mom so she's been wondering why I'm not in work. My boss made her step father call me and apologise and did all the things I think they're supposed to do and I feel horrible for letting them down because they need someone to deliver stuff and I'm the one putting a wrench in their chain, but at the same time the thought of being back in a truck for a whole day delivering furniture with a guy twice my age who has expressed that kind of interest in me makes me feel really uncomfortable. 

I feel like I'm being so childish. Everyone who knows what happened thinks I'm trying to play it up for some time off. Am I being an immature asshole by fucking everyone over because of this?

22300,Not the A-hole,"I'm not super religious, but I grew up with it. My dad is Jewish, mum is Catholic, and I was raised in both faiths, but as an adult I've sort of stepped away from religion. However, some stuff remains, including the Jewish practice of writing His name as ""G-d"". As a child, I was taught this was a sign of respect, and now as an adult it's more of a habit than anything, but I feel genuine discomfort when I write His full name.

I'm in uni on a literature course and for my most recent round of assessments we were given a bunch of religious stories and asked to write about one. One was about someone's struggle between the Jewish and Catholic faiths so I was like ""yup, that's mine"" and wrote my essay on it. I had to write ""G-d"" about 10 times in my essay, and did debate using the full version but it just didn't sit right with me.

I felt pretty good about the essay as my average grade #is a high B, with the occasional A, but a few weeks later I got it back and it was a D. Specifically, it was the highest possible D grade (49%). In the notes, it said that it was a really good essay, but unfortunately they couldn't grade me higher than a D due to ""a repeated spelling error"". I then saw the only word they'd marked as misspelled was ""G-d"".

I figured the just didn't know about the whole situation with His name, so I submitted it for re-marking, and in the box where I'm meant to explain why I think it's marked incorrectly I explained my use of ""G-d"".

My essay got sent to a different marker, marked at an A (86%), with the new marker commenting basically everything the first marker said about it being a great essay, without the thing about spelling.

About a week ago I got an email from someone at the university who I don't know asking if they could have a copy of my essay. I assumed he was a moderator wanting to check my new grade so I sent it. Today I got an email asking for my account of the grading as the lecturer is being investigated for antisemitism.

I'm staying with mum and dad and I don't know what to do, so I told them. Dad says I did the right thing and they wouldn't do this over one student complaining about a bad grade, there were probably other incidents. Mum, however, thinks I went too far, should have just taken the grade as it doesn't count towards my degree as I'm a first year and only grades from years 2 and 3 go to overall grades, and that I should have realised asking for a re-mark based on Jewish practices would start shit for this lecturer and that I may have compromised her career over a grade that won't matter in September. She says I should respond to the email saying that there was no antisemitism at play here, while my dad thinks I should just let things play out and go along with the investigation. If they're not antisemitic, they get to prove it, if they are, they get dealt with by the uni in an appropriate way.

Update apparently a guy on my course who's also Jewish and also wrote The Name like that had the exact same thing happen to him.

I (29m) have been dating my girlfriend (27f) for a year and a few months.  She moved in with me just about three weeks ago.  Honestly, since she's moved in I've been feeling a bit smothered. She's currently unemployed due to Covid and doesn't seem to be very aggressively looking for work and I feel like she sort of expects my attention all the time, and I feel like she's been scrutinizing me too much.

I'm an essential worker and recently was moved to overnights. Yesterday morning when I got home from work at a little after 7am she wasn't awake yet. I was a little too wound up from work to go straight to bed so I decided to pour myself a bourbon and sat down to find something mindless to watch on YouTube.  

My girlfriend got up maybe 15 or 20 minutes later and came into the living room where I was sitting. As I greeted her I saw her eyes narrow as she looked at the glass in front of me. ""Wait a minute,"" she said. ""You're actually *drinking*?""

""Yeah, so?"" I answered.

""It's morning. Who drinks first thing in the morning?"" 

I tried to explain to her that it wasn't ""first thing in the morning"" to me, that this was my evening time, and that just because I worked overnights didn't mean that I shouldn't be able to unwind after work with a drink like anyone else. But she just couldn't seem to get past that it was ""morning.""

Finally I'd had enough and told her that she needs to stop smothering me, that I'm a grown man and unless I'm doing something egregious that I shouldn't have to justify myself to her and that I don't need to her permission to have a drink. I told her that I was trying to relax and that if she was just going to give me a hard time to please just leave me alone.

She's been pretty quiet with me since. I know I hurt her feelings which I feel bad about, but I also think she was being unreasonable and somewhat controlling and that I wasn't wrong to tell her to knock it off. AITA?

15337,Not the A-hole," To be honest, I really don’t know how to title this one without giving the whole story away so here it goes. My boyfriend (30M) and I (25F) rent a house together in a nice town by the ocean. We have an great landlord that can sometimes be weird but otherwise he is a good guy. The other day I was home alone, smoking some weed and cleaning around the house. There was a knock and doorbell ring at the door, so obviously I go to answer it (and spray some febreze first lol). Random guy says “Hello I’m so and so from a local solar panel company and I was wondering if I could come in and take a look inside the house and the attic.” I glance behind him and I don’t see a car with any solar panel company logo. I say something along the lines of no, I wasn’t informed by my landlord that anyone would be stopping by so I’m sorry but have a good day. He insisted. He said something like please I’m supposed to do this, are you sure he isn’t here etc. etc. I again say no, told him to call my landlord then and proceeded to shut the door. That was that, stranger saunters off. 

 Later on that day, landlord stops by and is kind of annoyed with me. Landlord says“ that guy drove two hours to come here and you just sent him off like that. You should buy him a six pack or something to say sorry!” He kept going on about it. I told him next time someone is stopping by to inform me because I will never let a stranger in the house regardless if I am alone or not. 

 Also, I did not mention this is not the first time he has sent someone by without informing me and I have shut the door in their face.

7393,Not the A-hole,"I was walking down the sidewalk today when a group of kids came running towards me. Where I live it’s a widely agreed upon convention that pedestrians keep right except to pass in the way that cars do. These kids were in my lane and they were old enough to know better. In the distance I heard a parent put out a half assed “watch where you’re going, Kaden.” 

Kaden didn’t watch where he was going. 

As anticipated it soon became clear he expected me to get out of his way for him. I saw this as a teaching opportunity and decided to not alter my walking path or cadence. Shortly after he ran face first into me. Now I’m not entirely heartless so I made sure he didn’t connect with my knee, but he did land square on his butt. Once on the ground he thought for a moment, rolled over, hopped up, and ran away. The absence of an apology was noted. 

I feel what I did was reasonable. I firmly believe that if I had moved out of his way I’d’ve reinforced his bad behavior. By assisting him to the ground I helped him learn an important lesson about keeping right and the consequences of being careless. Mombie clearly wasn’t impressed but didn’t say anything.

2602,Not the A-hole,"I met a girl in a class and we very quickly became best friends. She didn't have much of a friend group of her own since she just got back from studying abroad, so she joined in on mine pretty quickly. She was the type of person to want to be close with everyone and have as many friends as she could, she would ask my friends to hang out one on one without me pretty quickly into the friendship, which felt a little weird but honestly didn't really bother me much, as she would always tell me about it after and just seemed excited to be connecting with people again. I have a boyfriend who lives about an hour and a half away from me and due to different schedules we see each-other every or every other weekend, sometimes longer between. 

She asked me for his number so that she could text him to try to make coffee plans with him next time he was in town so she could get to know him more one on one. My issue was that since he lived far away this would take away from the time that i got to spend with him. I felt this was a little weird and so i explained to her that since i don't get to see him everyday (or even once a week most times) that i didn't feel like she needed to have his number or be hanging out with him one on one and that she could get lunch or something with us next weekend when he came to visit me. All was fine, she said she totally understood why i felt that way and we moved on.

Didn't think about this again until a month or so later- i was hanging out with my boyfriend and he casually said that my friend had texted him. I asked him how he had her number and he said that about a month ago she had DMed him on insta because she had a good idea for a birthday gift he could get me. Okay, totally fine. What i had an issue with is that she DMed him asking for his number so that she could text him the gift idea, and then proceeded to randomly text him here and there (nothing too often or suspicious) about other things as well.

So i texted her about it. I wasn't at all trying to start anything i just stated something along the lines of ""hey, I just found out that you asked my boyfriend for his number and am just a little hurt that you would go behind my back when i had explain earlier why i don't feel like you need it. I'm not mad and no hard feelings at all, just wanted to explain how it made me feel!'. She got super defensive and kept saying that i was being dramatic and that she did it for me because she wanted me to get a good birthday present, and that she was just trying to be a good friend. At that point it did escalate a bit and we argue texted back and forth, i didn't reply after a while and we never talked again after that. She was a pretty selfish friend (was always late or would cancel plans after they were suppose to start, or just forget about them) so i didn't make a point to reach out and mend things after that, which part of me feels like i should have.

A part of this is intervals, e.g. repeating a pattern of running and walking as prompted by audio cues from the app. Last week was 60 seconds of walking with 15 seconds of running.

Someone who was sharing the outside space with me seemed to think I could do better, and that I wanted his instruction/encouragement to get 'better'. He matched my pace and was telling me to ""keep going"" and ""you can run longer than that"".

13293,Everyone Sucks,"I am a guy in my early 30’s who works at a restaurant, and we got a new employee a couple weeks ago named “Jane.” Jane is an older woman in her late 50’s, who seems like a good person, but is very, very annoying. She acts, as I said in my title, a lot like a “mother hen” to other employees - whenever she sees someone working with sharp, dangerous-looking objects, she gets big eyes, goes, “ooooh, careful”, and continuously pesters them that they’re not doing it safe enough/right, and reminds them over and over to “be careful.” She’ll frequently help people who insist they don’t need it and aren’t even in her department, and gives them advice on how to better do their job

It gets **very** annoying very fast, especially considering that she’s the new person. Typically, the “new guy” is the one who’s more submissive and deferential in his first couple weeks; to be a long time employee and have the new person treating **me** like a baby, or giving me advice on how to do my job, is very insulting.

The other week, I was using a large, sharp device/machine to cut some things up, and Jane stopped by, doing her usual “big eyes” and “oooooh, careful,” over and over. She kept leaning in my personal space and giving me pointers on how I could use the device “better” and “safer,” and how she “doesn’t want me to get hurt.” After a long time of this, I turned it off, put everything down, and confronted her.

“You want me to be safe, and get this sliced safely?” I asked her very harshly. “I’ll tell you what you can do - quit fucking bothering me while I’m working! I’m not a dipshit, I’ve worked here 20 times as long as you, I know how to use their fucking tools! You’re distracting the hell out of me, knock it off!” Her eyes got huge, she began quivering, and she replied that she was just trying to help. “What you are doing is the exact, reverse opposite of help! You want someone to get their goddamn finger sliced off - keep on doing what you’re doing! Distract and pester the hell out them, that’s gonna be bound to be the result! Mind your own damn business!”

Her eyes swelled with tears, and she hurried off. Someone I work with told me they saw her hiding out in an isolated part of the back room, crying very hard. I wanted to give her an apology, but she avoided me like the plague the rest of the day, and was so cold, quiet and unapproachable that I chickened out of doing so.

6712,Asshole,"My brother and his partner live overseas, so we rarely get to interact face to face. Every other Christmas is about how often they make the trip here. I gave birth to my daughter three months ago. It was by no means an easy birth, not as tough as some but I was definitely emotionally and physically depleted for the first couple of months. I was (and am still) reeling from having lost my mom two months prior to that. 

Without my mom in my life, I have no close, local family who were equipped to come by and help us at all since the birth. What family members we do have, and our small community of friends, have all made sure to reach out, to wish us well, and to try to help out in ways that made sense from afar. An Uber Eats gift card, a package of diapers from Amazon, that kind of thing.  We also had a nice baby shower that my mom threw for us right before she passed that helped set us up with the things we needed.

My brother texts me occasionally, maybe once every week or two for a brief chat. But he never asks about my daughter, instead it's just casual stuff he is interested in that we have always talked about, like football. I probably asked him to FaceTime with us a dozen times so he could see her in real time, but he always puts it off. He hasn't sent any kind of token or gift for the baby. 

I don't expect him to visit, I know that travel is tough for someone with his job and is expensive, and he was just here for our mom's funeral. But I feel like doing something to mark that he has a new relative, his closest living relative besides myself, would be kind of the normal and appropriate thing to do.

So the other day after getting rejected again for a video chat request I just asked point blank if there was something wrong with him, because it seemed like he didn't care much about the fact that he's an uncle now. He tried to play it off but when I pointed out that he could have at least sent a token gift for his niece he seized on that and made it seem like I was being materialistic. I really don't care if he spends a dime on her, I just want to give him some way to show that he cares more than an Instagram like's worth about my family, about me, about her.

6544,Not the A-hole,"So my mum pays for Netflix and has made an account for three people; herself (obviously), her boyfriend, and me. 

I LOVE Netflix, I use it a hell of a lot and I’ve logged onto it at my dads house a couple of times before so we could all watch movies together. (Me, my dad and his gf) and I don’t usually log out so I forget that they can use it at any time. One day I’m at my mums house and I see a bunch of new programmes on my ‘continue watching’ list despite the fact that I’ve never even clicked on them before. Obviously, my first thought is ‘what if I’ve been hacked’, so I tell my mum, who changes the password. I then realise it’s probably my dad or his girlfriend. When I think about this more, I still feel it’s right to change the password as they should not be using something that my mum pays for. 

Now this probably seems trivial and you’re wondering why it matters that my dad only seems to be watching a few movies or whatever. Well, firstly, my mum financially supports the two of us single handedly (she has a boyfriend but doesn’t live with him so he obviously can’t really contribute much) and will always make sure I am well cared for. My dad however, is a person who has spent his entire life saving and scrounging up money, (which there is nothing wrong with doing but I’m just pointing it out), not even mentioning the fact that his girlfriend has the money to buy a 5 bedroom house for them both to live in. And while they’re not certainly not rich, they definitely could spare money to pay for a Netflix account. 

A couple more points on how a Netflix account works; now, I’m not sure about the details on this one but the Netflix plan my mum is on means only two people get to watch at a time (which is pretty stupid ngl). So what if one of the people who actually has an account wants to watch it but can’t because others are already on it? It’s not particularly fair. Also, when my dad asked me about why he can’t log in anymore he states that he liked having an account ‘free of charge’, which kinda made me feel like I made a good decision not letting them watch it whenever they want without having to pay for their own. 

I’ll admit it was a petty move. But it’s up to you to decide if it was an asshole move.

I’m a young (22M) guy who loves to dance and go clubbing. At these clubs and dance floors, they get really loud and crowded and frequently you have to “lightly” push your way through to get through the crowd. 

When I’m trying to get through women, I generally put my hand on the small of their back and push from there. I do this because I feel like its gives me good leverage to get them out of my way and quickly and as smoothly as possible. I stay well clear of the girl’s ass and never have my hand there longer than I need to. If the girl is wearing a crop top or something where I would be touching her skin, than I try to put my hand higher if there’s fabric cuz I’m not trying to touch some stranger’s bare back. 

I would do this to men too honestly, however I’m bi and live in a conservative area and am extra paranoid about provoking a guy into a fight cuz he thought I was hitting on him. So I usually push them with my forearm and a much more aggressive to get through. 

Recently I was talking about this and a good friend of mine, told me that this was shitty of me and that girl’s don’t like being touched there at all. I have seen myself as benign cuz I’m just putting hand there to move them, and I’m not trying to “cop a feel”, I’m just trying  get to dance.

6230,No A-holes here,"Just trying to put this throwaway to good use and I really enjoy this sub. It's quite cathartic. This happened last month. So for context, I work at a non-profit. It's been a little under a year since I've been here and it's not been that great. I'm a 24 year old brown dude in an office full of all white girls between the ages of 26-60, except the President, an old white dude who is barely ever in. This context is important because being in that kind of environment, I kind of walk on eggshells and mostly keep quiet. They joke about how quiet I am all the time.  

This could not be any farther from the truth. I don't want to sound like I'm humble bragging but I am a bit of a social butterfly. I'm very much an extrovert and that's just my personality that I don't really display much at work because I simply can't relate to any of them and just out of respect. I come in, put my headphones, knock out my tasks, contribute to anything I'm asked to, and then leave. I'm always a participant, I never exclude myself, I just don't talk much when I'm here because I don't exactly feel comfortable telling this office about my personal life. 

So I'm at a bar and I'm chatting up this girl and we're having a good time and I lean in and we start making out. We do this for about a minute till I stop, look at the girl, then hear ""Heyyyy, [my name]"". I turn around, and it's the other younger co-worker of mine (26F). She just asks in a really sarcastic manner ""how's your night goin?"" I politely say it's going good and make a sarcastic remark about how this is bad and I should leave. We both laughed, and I left. Thought that was it. 

The following Monday we have a staff meeting and the Prez is not there so I'm the only dude. The Chief of Staff asks how everyone's weekend is and we all say good. Then the co-worker I saw at the bar points to me and says she knows I had a good weekend. Everyone turns to me ooh-inh and ahh-ing asking what I did. I smile and just said I went out this weekend to which my co-worker replied, ""he was kissing on a pretty cute girl when I saw him"". They started to laugh, ooh, and ahh even more. I immediately responded to her by saying ""Nice one. Real cool of you."" She was like ""whaaat you're young. It's fine"" I just stayed silent and the COS shut it down pretty quick when she saw my face. The co-worker later had to give me a really uncomfortable apology to which I just stopped her in the middle of it and said no hard feelings just don't say stuff like that.  

When I tell this story to some of my boys, they start calling me an asshole for reacting that way and I shoulda just ""been a man about it"". I don't know what that means. I just don't want my personal life spouted out like that, especially around a bunch of girls.

I've never actually mentioned to any co-workers that I could read lips & but I'm pretty sure most of them at least suspect it strongly.

A new co-worker started and I did my customary introduction and disclaimer about my hearing. 

I don't think she believed me because she got very offended when I ignored her. The problem being she was trying to get my attention from behind me and I genuinely did not hear her.

14298,No A-holes here,"My sister (call her Tiffany) has been married for about 15 years (we’ll call him Matthew). They have 3 children, the oldest of which is an adult. The younger two are in middle school. Their divorce is going like many divorces go and the two are currently separated and living apart. My sister has the boys. 

My mother is retired and she flew out to Tiffany’s when this all started. She’s been with Tiffany for almost a year now, helping around the house, giving support, and even helping to pay for an attorney (my mom is awesome). 

I am a Soldier and am currently stationed on the opposite side of the country as Tiffany. Back in October, I took leave and flew down to Texas to see her oldest son (Andrew) graduate from boot camp. Tiffany and Matthew were there as well (separated at the time but both supporting their son). It was fairly awkward but we’re all really proud of Andrew and wanted to be there for him. 

In December, I took leave again for the holidays and flew down to Tiffany’s because my mom was already there so I figured I could be with almost my entire family over Christmas. Tiffany was an absolute wreck but I tried to be a strong brother for her and it was nice seeing her boys again. Andrew also flew down. It was a decent trip and Tiffany said my presence there really helped. 

So in January I deployed. I’m not in a war zone or anything, just away from home training. I’m set to get back home around the beginning of June. I talked to Tiffany and my mom today and they both asked if I’m taking leave when I get back stateside. 

I am absolutely taking leave when I get back, but I want to do something nice for myself. I like being and traveling alone and that’s what I’d like to do. I told Tiffany I hadn’t made any plans and it didn’t go over well. Am I the asshole for not wanting to fly across the country to see my sister for the 3rd time in less than a year? She’s family and I love her, but I feel like I’ve checked the box as far as support for her for at least a while longer. Should make plans for Christmas again?

This of course is an important family heirloom which has been passed down to the oldest male of the family. I'll be dammed to be the one to end this chain and ffs it even has my family's surname on it.

My ex girlfriend has been really bitter about the break up blaming me for her cheating saying its my fault she cheated on me because i couldn't support her emotionally and give her attention (i was in a rural village in Armenia teaching kids english for a month). Before that she said tried to deny the  cheating saying some drunk dude at a bar took advantage of her and she thought he was me. Anyways she's a lying shitbag. I was stupid and broke up with her while i was still in Armenia so she dumped all of my shit out of her place and my friend came to pick it up but she kept some of the valuables for herself including the watch. She refuses to give it back saying she needs financial compensation for emotional toll i put on her by being gone for a month and some other bullshit.

Her family would hate her for being a slut but also lying to them about the situation. I also have her nudes which i will expose if she doesn't give me back my stuff. I told her i am going to expose her unless she gives me my shit so she eventually conceded and gave it back.

So I'm currently on a week long trip of sorts with two friends.

She’s been pretty discreet about the surgery and has only been open about it with family and close friends. I completely understand her wanting to be private about it even though it’s pretty obvious, as she lost quite a bit of weight in a really short amount of time. So here’s where the trouble is, recently T has made some pretty rude comments about a friend of mine (that she is not close with, but knows through mutual friends) who got a boob job. She was basically making fun of her and calling her shallow for getting plastic surgery in front of a group of people that didn’t even know this girl. After quite a few of these comments, I finally chimed in and said something to the extent of “shouldn’t you be the last person judging someone else for getting a surgery that altered their appearance?” I didn’t even say what the surgery was, but again to those who knew her before the surgery, it’s pretty obvious what I was taking about. She got very quiet and blew off my comment, but then later on in private said that it was fucked up of me to say that and that she had her surgery for “health reasons.” Mind you, she has had a range of health issues since her surgery due to her not complying with proper diet/exercise/avoiding alcohol etc. so it’s kind of a stretch for her to say that the ONLY reason she got her surgery was to be healthier. I think it’s great she had the surgery, regardless of her motivation to do so, and I’m glad she is happier with herself, but I don’t think it’s fair to criticize other people for electing to get surgery that will also make them happier with their body.

My family, on the other hand, is extremely casual. We love to joke around and poke fun. I think if Kate’s family were to describe my family, there would be comments about propriety and lack thereof.

The day after the wedding, Kate’s parents hosted brunch at their house. When I arrived, I walked into the living room. Sitting there was Kate’s dad, her grandma, and my other brother. On the coffee table, there was a large serving platter. On the serving platter, there was a dip that had been prepared in a mold. You don’t see a lot of dip molds these days, so [here’s a visual](https://www.createdby-diane.com/2010/07/how-to-make-dip-more-appetizing.html) to give you an idea of what I’m talking about. This dip was a little different. It was about a foot long, in the unmistakable shape of a penis and testicles.

When I saw it, I thought I had misjudged my brother’s new in-laws. Food in the shape of dick and balls? What could be funnier than that? They had clearly been hiding their great sense of humour all this time. As soon as I saw the dip I burst out laughing.

“Something left over from the bachelorette party?” I said.

My brother’s father-in-law looked me dead in the eyes.

“It’s a lobster,” he said.

As other guests arrived, it became clear who was in my family and who was in Kate’s family. My family were all making thinly veiled penis jokes, while Kate and her family ignored us and pretended there wasn’t a giant dick on the table.

“So creamy,” my cousin said as she dug into the shaft with a cracker.

“They should have put some sprouts around the base,” my aunt said.

For months, I’ve been telling people the dick dip story, and anyone with a sense of humour thinks it’s hilarious. Last weekend, I had some people over to my house, and as a joke, I decided to make my own dick dip. Out of respect for my sister-in-law, who lives in a different city, I did not post any photos of the dick dip to social media. Some of my friends, however, couldn’t help themselves. Kate saw photos of the dick dip on a mutual friend’s Instagram story, and now she is upset.

10915,Not the A-hole,"About 5-6 months ago, I (18f) started having problems with my ears turning red and getting a lil warm. I scheduled an appointment with a dermatologist bc initially I thought it was allergies. Turns out it had to do with the cartilage in my ears rather than the skin. I was referred to a rheumatologist, for whom I had to go make another appointment for, but I couldn’t get in to see her for 3 weeks.

While I waited, my ears got worse. To the point where I can no longer leave my room anymore. I have to sit in my room all day, in the dark, in front of a fan, with ice packs strapped to my head because it’s that bad. The burning is excruciating and constant. I can numb it with ice packs, but only until they melt.

ALSO during this time, my sister (23f) began to experience lots of issues with cramps and pain in her abdomen. It turns out she has an ovarian cyst which is causing her pain whenever she has her period. I by no means discount that fact that she is in a lot of pain. She is very very vocal about how much it hurts. Here’s where I’m frustrated, however.

Once I finally get to the rheumatologist, she basically sits down and tells me that I have relapsing polychondritis. Which is a rare genetic autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the cartilage in the body. Since it’s so rare, they don’t know what triggers it, and treatment is mostly trial and error. They worry about long term because cartilage is everywhere in your body, including the heart and windpipe. If my body started to attack either of those, it could spell disaster. Basically, it could flare up in the wrong place at the wrong time and I could die at a young age because of it. The possibility of a flare up in my heart is a major concern, and I just learned all of this on Wednesday.

Meanwhile my sister is having issues with her cyst again, and is wailing and crying. For sure she is hurting, but also I just learned that I could die at any point. My parents have elected to skirt around that fact, and haven’t offered me a bit of comfort about it, instead focusing on my sister. I am forced (through pure necessity) to sit alone in my room all day long, every day, and have been for the last few weeks. I am extremely lonely. My parents make minimal effort to check on me. At most it’s a brief four sentence conversation and then they go right back upstairs to take care of my sister. Nobody comes to talk to me, nobody comes to see me, nobody sits with me.

Tonight I made it it upstairs to get some food, and I saw my mom in my sister’s room, lying on the bed with her, rubbing her back and comforting her.

I never wanted and still do not want to be part of the Pride movement. I just want to be able to live my life with my boyfriend. 

My older brother is currently overseas and has a son Aaron, who is 13, with his wife. When my brother is away I kind of step up and help out with Aaron when I can.

I picked up Aaron from school on Friday and he seemed more quiet than usual. I asked him what was going on and he told me that he needed to talk to me. 

He the proceeded to come out to me and told me that I was his “role model” and that I’m the only one who knows that he’s gay. 

I got uncomfortable but thanked Aaron for telling me and made an excuse about having to get to work.

I just have no interest in being a “gay role model” for any kid. It’s not something I ever wanted. Maybe this makes me selfish, but I came out for myself, not to be part of a movement. 

He texted me later that night thanking me for “being so cool about it.” 

I took some time and sent him the following message: 

“Thank you for telling me Aaron. While I understand why you would tell me, I don’t think I am the right person to support you through this.  Please go see your guidance counsellor at school or talk to The Trevor Project or a group like that. I am not entirely comfortable being a role model for you and I think you should look elsewhere for some support.”

18369,Not the A-hole,"Background: I'm 32, my husband is 35. We have been together for 8 years, married for 5. This year we decided to try for a baby and we got pregnant! We found out it was going to be a boy and started looking at names.

Now, in the early 2000s I watched a show (idk how specific I'm allowed to be) and one of the characters was named Sawyer. Yes, I thought the character was hot. After that I started to fall in love with the name independently of anything. I just thinks it's a really beautiful name.

After we found out it was a boy, we started to seriously discuss baby names. My husband proposed a bunch that I didn't really like, and I also put out several names that he didn't want. Eventually I put ""Sawyer"" out there as a name. To my surprise, my husband said that he actually really liked that name and we ended up choosing it.

Recently my husband and I have had a lot more time to spend together. Yesterday we were cuddling and talking about the baby. It was a normal conversation. He said that he was really glad we chose Sawyer, and asked me why I suggested it and what the inspiration was for the name I guess. At first I said that I just thought it was a beautiful name, but he wanted to know more, like when I first heard it. So I told him not thinking that it would be a problem.

But my husband got pretty mad. He said he was angry that I would name an actual human over a TV show character. He was also pretty mad that the only reason I liked that name is because someone hot had it. He also said that he feels like I'm kind of obsessed to be naming my baby after him. Mostly he was mad that I hadn't told him when I offered the name.

But I really don't agree. I wouldn't say the baby is named after a TV character, and it's not like he's named Naruto or something. Sawyer is a normal name and it's not like he'll be bullied for it. I also said that I'm clearly not obsessed with the show or the character. I've watched the show a total of twice in my life and that's it. I also said that I didn't lie at all. When he asked me, I told him.

5253,Not the A-hole,"Together 2 yrs. He went bald in his teens, completely bald by age 19 or 20. No medical condition, just very early onset male pattern baldness. I am hugely sympathetic – your hair is a big part of how you look, and I can’t imagine how hard that’d be as a teen. Not diminishing the importance or what a big deal that is to guys, especially so young. I get it. 

He is going to interview for medical residency soon and all he can talk about is how no one is going to hire him because he’s bald. He’s 6’2”, slim and athletic (swimmer/runner body), Caucasian, very handsome and symmetrical face, perfect teeth. Some people don’t like the bald look, but everything else is conventionally perfect. And he’s very sociable, intelligent, great with kids (looking for pediatric-related residency, so that’s relevant), has good grades, etc.

He goes on and on about how being bald is going to hold him back, nobody’s going to hire him, he should’ve gone to school for a job where you don’t interact with the public so employers might still hire him and just keep him in the background where nobody has to see him. In short, he’s being ridiculous, but he actually says this stuff very seriously, every single day.

I, on the other hand, am a very petite (4’11”, 95 lb), very young-looking (I was carded for an R-rated movie last year), dark-skinned black woman, also a doctor.  I started a little younger than he did, so I’m almost done with my surgery-related residency. It’s a constant struggle for me to be taken seriously as a surgeon. I am ALWAYS confused for a secretary or medical assistant (at best, a nurse) even when I’m in my surgical scrubs. This includes patients, staff, and other doctors. Patients don’t trust my advice, staff don’t take my instructions as seriously, colleagues aren’t always welcoming. That’s its own story, suffices to say I have a hard time and probably always will.

I just deal with it (what choice do I have?) but it’s really bothering me lately how much my SO whines about being bald when he otherwise has THE most stereotypical “doctor look” ever. I honestly want to tell him that I’m not the right person to complain to about that, considering how much harder I objectively have it, and that he needs to grow up. It just makes me roll my eyes being a dark-skinned black woman who looks like a third-grader, comforting this tall, thin, athletic, handsome white man about how he’s such a poor victim of genetics and will never be accepted into medicine because he has no hair, and reassuring him that he isn’t too “weird looking” to get a residency. Get a grip.

WIBTA if I told him how tone-deaf he’s being and to stop complaining to me about it? Again, I know going bald is a big deal.

My daughter is attending school, and the school teacher put up a sign on the classroom door full of misused apostrophes and other grammar and punctuation errors.

* It could have been her assistant who made and put up the sign.

6788,Asshole,"This is my first ever post on this sub and I figured it's probably a good idea to use a throwaway so I don't give my wife another reason to be pissed at me. 

She was hosting a party at our house on Saturday. It was honestly more of a work event and she was super excited about it because she wanted it be our first ""mature"" party (meaning their were cocktails/wine as opposed to a keg, little sandwiches as opposed to pizza and our new hot tub was off limits so no bikinis either...I was joking with her that it sounded like the ""no-fun-arty"" which she found mildly amusing the first time I said it but the next 10000, not so much). 

So she got home Friday and worked until almost 2AM preparing and storing all the food she wanted to serve. There was some sort of work emergency at 7AM so she had to go in and I didn't even realize she was gone until I woke up at about 10. She texted me at like 5 and said she was having the most awful day ever and said she was thinking about cancelling the party. I told her that I would help in whatever way I could. She said it would be awesome if I cleaned up. 

I know me and my wife have very different cleaning standards but I very honestly did the best I could. I cleaned up all our mail that accumulates, cleaned the bathroom to what I thought was spotless, wiped down the kitchen and even started to warm up all the food she prepared. 

She ended up getting home at 6:45 and jumped right in the shower. Guests started showing up at 7 and it didn't even occur to me that I was still wearing my dirty cleaning clothes as I was greeting and chatting with her guests.  

She came out and in a stern ""mom voice"" she demanded to talk to me in the bed room. She laid into me like no one's business. I mean a brief laundry list of all my offenses: 

1. not wearing appropriate clothes. She didn't give me credit that I had been cleaning right until 7 because:

2. There was dog hair apparently everywhere, including the couch and there were piles of where it builds up next to the furniture. I had completely forgot to vacuum and everyone was getting dog hair on their clothes from sitting on the couch. 

3. I guess I missed some huge pee spots on the toilet.

4. I had missed her text that I needed to go get ice. 

5. I guess instead of warming up these salmon/cream cheese wheels I was just supposed to take them out but I put them in the oven and ruined them. 

6. and she reminded me of no-fun-arty.

Even with all that, the party went off just fine but it's Wednesday now and she is still made at me and says that my behavior and the jokes in the weeks leading up to the party show that I didn't even care how much it meant to her and my behavior that day makes her think I don't even care about her.

She follows a lot of family accounts on Instagram she would once in a while send me videos of kids and say “lol this is totally our future kid) 

I was very adamant  that I wanted to wait until we could afford a house, pay off some debts and establish our careers  before getting married and then we would have kids. She just finished her masters and I finished physiotherapist school and would love to start my own physiotherapy business in the future. She always agreed that we weren’t ready for kids but it was obvious she had intense baby fever. My girlfriend is on birth control and takes the depo provera shot every 3 months. 

3 days ago my girlfriend tells me that she’s 2 months pregnant and she just found out. I was absolutely shocked. Honestly I suggested an abortion at this point but my girlfriend was adamant against it and said she was pretty excited for the baby and was mad I was even suggesting abortion. 

So honestly,  I did accuse her of intentionally getting pregnant because it honestly just made the most sense. She was acting so excited like it was planned, her past behaviour showed she was looking forward to a baby and I never followed up to make sure she was getting all her shots.

SORRY TYPO MY WIFE IS 51 not 21 

So my oldest son (Jake) is getting married to his high school girlfriend (Lucy F24). My wife hasn’t always been supportive of their relationship (she sort of dislikes her irrationally in my mind). But for the sake of her relationship with Jake she hasn’t said much about it. I’ve always been supportive of their relationship, she made him happy and she is generally a lovely person and polite. We both get along great and she’s close friends with my younger son as well. I’ve always tried to make her feel welcomed within our family when my wife acts hostile. 

So, fast forward to the situation. Lucy’s father passed away a few years ago and she didn’t have anyone to walk her down the aisle. I offered her (as I already saw her as a daughter) and said I’d feel honoured to walk her down the aisle as a more offical welcome to our family.

I argued that it was ridiculous she was still acting hostile to her even after almost eight years of them dating. I asked her why was she so against them being together. She just argued that she didn’t see them being married and having kids together that they’re different and she doesn’t really fit in with our family.
I said that she did fit in it’s was only her that was making her feel like ‘odd one out’ and that had she taken the time to really get to know her like I’ve done she’d see her differently.

3710,Asshole,"Hello good people, this question has bugged me for quite some time and a recent incident convinced me to come to this sub to get an answer. 

I live in the US and drive on the highway for 2-3 hours on trips quite often. I don't drive too high above the speed limit, I use my signal to change lanes, and I'm a defensive driver, so all in all I consider myself a relatively safe driver. If I'm on long stretches of highway, I typically get in the left most lane and set my cruise control to 10 miles above the speed limit (or what traffic is currently going) so I don't have to worry about switching lanes and keeping my foot on the pedal constantly for long periods of time as I get foot cramps really easily that are painful and annoying on long car rides. However, I realize that some people want to go faster than 10 miles over the speed limit, but I always figured going 80 mph in a 70 mph is a reasonable speed and there's usually an oppurtuntity for people to pass me in another lane. 

However, I was driving the other night on a trip and I did my usual thing. Things were fine for a while, but then a large truck came up right behind me and began tailing me. There were plenty of opportunities for the truck to get into another lane and get ahead of me, but it continued to tail me, getting dangerously close to me. Finally, the truck switched lanes, sped up, and then jumped back into my lane. They then proceeded to brake check me, forcing me to slow down. To prevent them from doing anything further, I changed lanes and slowed down to around 65 mph in a 70 mph zone on the highway. 

So Redditors, am I the asshole?",139,102,0.81,AITA for not getting over into the right-hand lane on the highway?,d7j9h6,2019-09-22 00:37:58,YTA,1626,AITA,"The author, an experienced and defensive driver in the US, frequently sets their cruise control 10 mph above the speed limit during long highway trips for comfort, believing this is a reasonable speed that allows faster drivers to overtake.

4487,Asshole,"Im 16 and I live in England with my mum and my step-dad. My brother, 25 , has moved back in due to my mum not being able to afford rent for my brother. I was tasked to get the apartment in a reasonable state for the security deposit, when I found out that he hadn't cleaned the apartment in 1+ year(s) I was worried, when I entered the kitchen area was disgusting. E.g literal food waste not being moved. Black mold was also collecting in the top corners of the rooms. Obviously my mum didn't get the security deposit back.

For the past year, and the most recent months he has ballooned it weight. 300kg is my estimate as he refuses to go on scales. I have offered to go to the gym with him or help him on a diet but he refuses. All he does is eat and play Xbox all day. Nevermind that he has a minifridge full of energy drinks that he has replaced water with. 

My brother drenches T-shirts when walking 100 meters.

Last month he was diagnosed with type 2 diabities and refuses to take it seriously. He also complains of having sleep apnea. I believe he falls asleep all the time as his body can't support his own weight while doing simple tasks.

Next month he starts University for the 3rd time doing social sciences for the 3rd time. As he didn't pass the first two times. My brother is jn £40,000 worth of debt from the University and doesn't take it seriously. 

Yesterday was is third appointment with his counselor. And all he does is post shitty quotes on Facebook about how mentally strong he is.

My Grandma religiously defends him, She was very angry when I said that my brother is nothing but a detriment not only to my mum's life but to mine as well. 

I would be genuinely relieved if my brother died of a heart attack. AITA?

11316,Not the A-hole,"I’m just a little bit bewildered by a situation with a friend of mine. We have been friends over the past few years, and grew close over a shared experience we have had which was quite traumatic and sad, so to me she was a dear friend. 

We originally know each other from living in a similar area and being in the same social group and became closer together as she opened up about experiences on Instagram, which I identified with and we ended up being close.
Her online following has now grown and she has a few thousand followers, and constantly talks about her account and sees it as a huge deal. She often told me how stressed and busy it made her, and she did kind of start to be distant from me and my other friends in favour of ‘bloggers’ to which I didn’t really understand as I don’t spend much time on instagram or care that much about likes and followers, but I’ve always been supportive of her account, followed her, liked things and commented when she’s needed a bit of a boost when promoting a brand. 

She always talked about how you should always be there for friends, and talks about having good values and being a good person etc. on her social media, but recently she became extremely bad at replying and actually being there when I needed her. She’d half make plans with me and then never reply back when I said that I can do that time/date etc and has been increasingly absent and a bit of a crappy friend. 

I bumped into her recently and I was a bit off with her, as to me she was no longer the good friend I used to know. 

She then messaged me to say sorry if she hurt my feelings, and she could tell I was being off with her , and she knows she hasn’t made effort with me recently. This has been brewing in me for about 6 months, so I just said that it’s pretty shitty to make plans and then be uncontactable and not interested in seeing me. She then said that because of her Instagram account, she is so busy that shes not ‘seeing people’ anymore- so she isnt meeting with actual friends anymore because her Instagram account is taking up all her time.  I kind of went in on her a little bit, saying that I’m a real person and meant to be a good friend that she’s being horrible to, and shes putting Instagram followers over our friendship, to which she had no other reply than ‘We all have different opinions, good luck for the future ‘.  

She’s 30 years old and I find this so odd and such arsehole behaviour! Am I the asshole? Or is she?

Edit: for info, the instagram account is not her main job. She has said before it brings her a bit of extra cash and some freebies. I get that everyone has different interests, but no friend has ever dropped me for a side project before!

Edit: for info, people have been asking how many followers she has. Its around 4k.

Edit: also, people have accused me of pushing my friend and saying i’m unsupportive, which is not the case. Ive always been there to support her whilst she had this page and engaged with her when shes said she’s lacking interest on a particular post, I always comment , like, give advice, take photos etc. And her instagram page is what brought us together in the first place",41,218,0.95,AITA for calling a friend out when she says she can’t meet up with me anymore because her Instagram account is busy to maintain?,bwpsm5,2019-06-04 15:09:05,NTA,3170,AITA,"The author expresses confusion and hurt over their friendship with a previously close friend who has become distant and preoccupied with her growing Instagram account, prioritizing it over personal connections.

19984,Asshole,"Our neighbours are quite a noisy family of five kids (the oldest being about 10) and our family has been quite accommodating towards them. We helped sort out their garden, given them several toys and playhouses my brother grew out of and have been generally nice.

Recently, we were inspired by a few lovely families in our neighbourhood to leave a box of (sanitised) toys and books for other children stuck at home in the lockdown because we understood how difficult it could be. An hour or two into our box being put outside, our neighbours had carried the entire box inside with them, including a few YA books with a 17+ description. We have felt this is extremely selfish, the children were in no way going to read or benefit from those books and we had planned for the toys to be shared to more than one family so everyone could benefit. The children have also been distressing my autistic brother and tricking him into throwing his own toys over the fence as they claim the toys are 'theirs', so I may be biased on the situation.

Said family has also left to go to the seaside during the strictest part of quarantine and invited several people from other households into their house without social distancing measures.

18081,no a--holes here,"Hi Reddit

My BF is getting back from a work trip tonight, and he's been away for a while so I figured it would be nice to pick him up from the airport. He missed his original flight which was going to get in at 7:15PM, and had to catch another one getting in 12:30am (ugh). When it came time for him to depart, he told me that the plane was about half an hour late in taking off, so he'd be getting in at one (uuuuugh). I say no biggie. Not ideal, but ok.

I go to check the flight schedule to see what's up, and lo and behold, his flight is actually delayed by more than a full hour, so it looks like he's scheduled to get in at 1:45. He's in the air, and it'll be a couple hours before I head to the airport, but I feel like A) he should know that he's going to be delayed quite a bit longer than originally expected and B) should probably try to contact me about this? He's on a flight that definitely has wifi, so he's more than capable. I sent him a few chagrined messages when I found out asking why he wouldn't try to let me know what the actual delay was, and I feel like I might have been too harsh. At the same time, I'm majorly going out of my way for him and feel like he should at least be making some attempt to keep me in the loop about this.

Little backstory. My parents divorced when I was 15, mom never remarried and my older brother and I are very close to her. My father remarried maybe 6 years later to a woman who had 3 kids already. There was never a discussion on my fathers end about what him getting remarried entailed, and what my brother and I thought about having step siblings as well as a step mother.

My wife hired my cousin's cousin (a decorator) company based on her recommendation. My wife does event planning and needs to have good reliable contractors.

Immediately, this woman provided horrible service. Not showing up to a site visit without any explanation, over promising and not remembering what she promised, holding back on giving estimates or quotes.

My wife was stressed dealing with her and wanted to fire her but I told her just stick it out and I'll try to get my cousin to talk to her.

My cousin did but apparently it went the other way, all her cousin did was bitch about my wife and how controlling and anal she was.

I explained to my cousin the truth, even sent her screen shots of unanswered emaild, calls, texts, some outright lies etc.

At the day off the event the decorating she was supposed to be doing was so plain, and not what she agreed with my wife, but my wife kept it in and actually went and got more decorative stuff borrowed for the event. In the end, my wife and her worker did a really nice job.

Later during the event, the 'decorator' came in with my cousin and was taking food, free drinks and then taking pics of the decor (to probably use in her future portfolio). This pissed my wife off immensely as she was tired and frustrated, she told the decorator that she wasn't a guest at this event and that she needs to leave. She told her she'll return all her materials tomorrow, but will sue her if she uses it in her portfolio.

This angered her so much that she began to take down get decor during the event and caused scene. Security eventually escorted her out.

7477,Everyone Sucks,"My family runs a tour company that operates small to large tour groups around the surrounding region. These span from scenic tours, historic sites, and even some whale watching. 

In order to make things run more smoothly, and also to the benefit of our customers, some of these tours are group focused. For example, we have tours specifically for Chinese and Taiwanese tourists with bilingual guides. 

Along these lines, my mother started organising family tours a while ago specifically for parents with young kids. She is very family oriented and these tours are her pride and joy so to speak, being specifically geared towards making sure the kids enjoy themselves as well as their parents. It’s also a great opportunity for kids to make new friends.

Now, because these are a hobby of my mother and done for the benefit of new families, they are significantly cheaper than the main tours. 1 or 2 parents can simply buy a family pass for a set price and bring up to 3 kids at no extra cost. The family pass costs significantly less than two adult tickets for the equivalent normal tour group. For this reason, bringing at least one kid is mandatory, else people would take advantage of the price discrepancy. **We are very clear about this requirement.**

Fast forward to yesterday, a couple without any kids shows up to a family tour they had booked online. I immediately bring this up and they explain they’re “child free” and booked this one since the normal one was full. I explained that this is a family tour and we are very clear about this requirement, which sparked a ridiculous argument about them being discriminated against as a child free couple. The online booking system requires them to put in how many kids they have (1+) so they 100% knew they about this. They definitely lied to book the tour.

Eventually I relented and offered to let them join the tour provided they pay the difference between this and the normal one for two adult tickets. They refuse saying they already paid online and shouldn’t have to pay more than the advertised price. Again sparking a ridiculous argument about them being discriminated against. 

Eventually the tour is set to leave and they, accepting Im not gonna budge, demand at least a refund. I refuse since the tour was fully booked meaning their fraudulent online booking almost certainly meant we missed out on another family. 

They claim this is illegal, at which point I gave them the contact details of our family’s lawyer and said we would be happy to see them in small claims court. They swore at me before walking off defeated.

Since then our tour group has seen a bunch of fake reviews from a “child free” Facebook page claiming we’re evil etc. Luckily we got them removed since they’re obviously fake, but AITA for my response to them?

My daughter Emily and her boyfriend Justin have been dating for about 8 months now. They’ve gotten along pretty well and he’s a nice young man.(they’re both 17 and seniors in high school) My daughter is in the school drama program and she had a play on Saturday. She wanted Justin to come and watch her with us and he obliged. So Justin is a pretty introverted person. Justin’s family is Korean-American and his parents first language isn’t English.(though Justin has been in the U.S. since he was 3 and his first language is English) On top of that Justin’s friends aren’t Emily’s friends and vice versa. Because of those factors he’s not really known among my friends and Emily’s friend’s parents. At the play me, my husband, and Justin were waiting in line to be seated and we come across friends.

We say hi and Lily we get asked who Justin is. I introduce Justin as Justin, Emily’s friend. Then there was a passing mention of Emily’s ex Benjamin. I didn’t know it was important at that time, but one of my friends Lily mentioned Benjamin as Emily’s former boyfriend. Justin didn’t say anything, we watched the play, it was great and we all went back home. An hour after we got home my daughter told me that Justin wanted to ask me about something. He asked why I introduced him to my friends as just a friend instead of boyfriend or he’s dating Emily. He said it would be fine for me to introduce him as a friend, but my friends know Benjamin as Emily’s former boyfriend and they dated for barley a month. He and Emily have been dating for 8 months, but gets introduced as just a friend while Benjamin is known as a former boyfriend.

I was flustered(because I wasn’t expecting the question) and I told him that it was because Benjamin and his parents are well known and connected with my friends and him and his family are not. So it was just more natural for my friends to know Benjamin as a former boyfriend and Justin(who my friends just met) as just a friend. Justin was not happy with what I told him and told me that he feels the connection explanation is a veiled shot at him being Asian instead of white. He also feels humiliated like he’s not good enough to be Emily’s boyfriend and that’s why my husband and I merely introduce him as a friend. I told him to stop being so ridiculous and that I’d introduce him next time as Emily’s boyfriend if he really wants.

8616,Not the A-hole,"So I just read a post that made me think of this incident from a few months back, and I’m curious if ITA on this one. I needed to buy groceries one night, but I had had a really long day at work. So rather than walk down the street to the grocery store (literally a block away) I decided to just order them off Amazon, which is supposed to (and usually does) deliver directly to your front door. I have even put directions in the delivery notes section explaining exactly how to work the buzzer and get to my apartment in the building (it’s not hard).

I live in a rather large apartment building that’s shaped like an L, so it’s a bit of a trek to get to my apartment’s actual door. I can also see the main entrance where we buzz people in because of my apartment’s placement in the building.

So I’m chilling at my kitchen table, playing on my phone and get a notification that my groceries are almost here. I then see a car pull up in front, check my phone, and confirm it’s probably the delivery driver. I can see him checking his phone and looking at the building. He sits there for a minute or two and then starts calling on his phone. I get a call from the Amazon number.

He tells me that he has tried the buzzer several times, it’s not working and he wants me to come meet him at the door to take my groceries. I’m annoyed, since I saw him pull up and know very well that he didn’t, but I feign surprise, ask him to try my boyfriends buzzer number (it goes to our cell phones) and call me back if it doesn’t work. He tries to get me to come down to meet him several more times, then finally agrees in a clearly annoyed tone.

I then watch him just sit in his car for another 2-3 minutes doing nothing, at which point he tries to call again. I’m pissed now, since I figure he is just being lazy and the whole point of ordering the groceries (and having to pay tip) was that I didn’t want to leave my apartment. So  I just ignore the call. He tries calling 8 more times and I refuse to pick up. I decide I’m not picking up until he gets out of his car and actually tries the buzzer.

Instead, he leaves an angry voicemail and drives off, marking my groceries as “undeliverable.” I immediately call Amazon customer service, explain that he sat in his car and never even tried to deliver them, and insist on a full refund, including the tip. They agree.

We live in a very nice and expensive area that I wouldn’t be able to afford by myself. I needed a place to live after quitting my job and no longer being able to afford my apartment, after telling him he asked me to move in with him. I must admit I was a little uneasy moving in with him at first, but so far everything has been going well. I cook and clean for him whenever he’s at home, which is about 3 days a week, and in return I get to live here rent free and spending money that is equal to my previous wage. We have now been living together for 18 months.

I have access to all the rooms in the house bar the gym. This wasn’t a problem for me as I previously used my local gym with his sister (35f), then I was pregnant, so I didn’t need to go gym. Recently I have decided its time to lose the baby weight and start going to gym again, when I mentioned to him that I would like the access code to the garage he asked why and after telling him I want to use the gym he refused. When I asked him why he said that there’s thousands of dollars of equipment in the gym that he doesn’t want me to use in case I damage it and that its pretty dangerous as he has a lot of car parts and tools lying around, I got pretty mad and kind of shouted at him that when I moved in we agreed I have total access to all rooms but now he’s refusing me access to the garage, its pretty stupid that just he thinks I might damage his equipment even though I’ve been lifting weights way longer than he has and that I can take care of myself. 

I feel kind of conflicted as I know that I’m in the right, but it is his house and I am grateful of the relationship we have and all he’s done for me, but I feel as if all my life I’ve been told no or you can’t do so and so and I thought he was different.

We haven’t spoken about anything other than our daughter for the last week, I haven’t cooked or cleaned for him as well as I feel that if he doesn’t hold up his end, I shouldn’t hold up mine. So far, he is avoiding me and spends most of his time in the garage. His parents and sister and my family and friends are with me on this but say that we’re both being immature and need to find an agreement.

My boyfriend started getting into investing and trading soon after he met me and made a significant amount of money during the recovery. Honestly most of it is likely luck. He would put all of his spare money into his trading account to play with and it is now approaching 3m USD.

I recently asked him when we were going to get married and he brought up the topic of a prenup. He thinks that since I have little to no savings and he is worth a lot now, that he needs to protect himself “just in case.” Putting aside how insulting this was that he doesn’t think our marriage would last, I also think it’s completely unreasonable. 

Prenups are supposed to protect wealth that pre-exists a relationship. All of this money was made during our relationship - including years of us living together. While it’s true he pays for his share of the bills etc I don’t think that matters. It wouldn’t matter if we were married during this time so why should it matter if we weren’t?

He is the type of person who likes to help out and is a good handyman and mechanic. He rarely accepts payment and just takes pleasure out of a job well done.

As a result he has a reputation as a complete yes man.

My husband is close to one neighbour ""Fred"", they are inseparable and he is always helping him out and fixing cars together. We all get on well with Fred and will always help each other out where we can.
It's a total bromance.

So My husband had agreed to help a different neighbour, a single mum, to rebuild her fence.

Fred et al. were outside and drinking. The hot sun and beer didn't mix very well. 

All day they were catcalling my husband telling him he was going to get sex as payment etc. Which my husband ignored, but it persisted for the whole day.

However, it did upset my stepdaughter (14) who found it offensive as they kept on.

Later he and ""Sam"" were going to have a social distance beer.

The catcalling started again. Even though he was in Sam's front garden.

My husband ignored them which I think pissed them off. They were very drunk by this point.

My step daughter had had enough, she shouted at them to stop and that me and her dad were married and she didn't like it.
They started shouting at her... these are all grown men.

So my husband shouted that was enough and they had upset her.
Fred got all up in my husband's face and shouted at him about ""what did you say to me?"" And my husband totally calm said he had upset her.

Fred told us all to f off and was very rude.

My stepdaughter comes in crying and said she had caused a fight and it was her fault but she couldn't bear what they were saying about her dad because it wasn't true.

I'm pregnant and hormonal so I got cross. I consoled her but I could still hear them shouting shit outside so I went out there and confronted Fred.

I'm 5ft 8 and I got a bump.

Fred on the other hand is 6ft 5. So he towers over me.

I went over and said I understood it was a joke and they all thought it was funny but you made her really upset and cry.
I also said the joke had gone too far and that they needed to stop.

My husband has started coming over, by this point Fred is screaming in my face that he doesn't care that he made her cry and that I can f off and get out of his face. 

I said it was unacceptable and he had crossed the line making a child cry for no good reason.

He's in my face shouting at me and my husband pulled me away and told me to leave it.

It was all so unexpected and nasty.
But I told him I didn't want him to be friends with Fred anymore. I thought Fred had been totally out of order and his true colours had come out.

So here is where I might be TAH? Was it out of order for me to tell my husband not to be friends with Fred anymore and for getting involved and essentially getting into a fight with Fred myself?

Late last year they held a mother and son race where the mother had to run across the field and piggy back their sons back to the other side and then tie our legs together and just sprint back across. 

A week prior my stepson Dylan was talking about it and how he thought it was ridiculous and embarrassing. When I looked at their poster for it, it looked fun so I convinced him to sign up for it. Later that day I called his mother Julie but she didn't pick up so I left a voicemail talking about the event and asking her to get back to us if she is available. Five days past and still no word from her. Being honest when she didn't respond, I saw it as an opportunity for Dylan and I to bond but since I respect Julie as his mother I sent her an email (doesn't use social media) with the poster and talking about how Dylan has signed up for it. Two days passed and still nothing. So I went to Dylan and told him that his mother hadn't gotten back to me but if he was okay with it, I was willing to step in since it was too late to pull out. He was a bit disappointed but still fine.

The day came and it was a blast. Tiresome but definitely worth it. It was just so much fun and I made a few friends there who were also stepmothers. And obviously we won 1st place and got two medals. Dylan also enjoyed it and feels way more comfortable with me now.

While I was browsing the school's website last week, I saw a picture from that day with me running and Dylan cheering on my back. It was a cute picture so I downloaded it and made it my profile picture. Turns out one of Julie's friends showed her the picture and now she's going on a rant about how I shouldn't have done that and how I've overstepped my mark as his step mother.

21618,Not the A-hole,"This happened recently between me (19M) and a friend (32M) that I lost contact with 3 years ago. The both of us had feelings for each other at that point in time, despite how we only texted over phone, and I never got to know who he really is, or how he looked like. He revealed very little about himself, and all I knew about him is that his name was ""Kevin"".

One day, we argued because I kept pushing to meet up and have a simple meal together, after about half a year of us texting each other. We argued because he was too insecure to meet & I couldn't understand why.

3 years have passed. I looked back at how childish I was, and tormented myself for not being able to understand his insecurities. He revealed that he's been rejected based on looks more times than he can recall. I felt bad about my actions for blocking him and decided to look for him.

Later, I found his name in a school yearbook and decided to look it up. I found a profile on a local university with the same name.

I decided to look around for ways to email this person, but couldn't find any. Eventually, I found the Facebook profile of another who I assumed was his ex-classmate, and sent her a message politely greeting her and saying that I am looking for this person ""Kevin"" with regards to his works (I cited his research paper). She told me that he has left the academia. However, she pointed me to reach out to their Professor, who might have a clue. I thanked her for her help, & emailed the professor. Seeing that there was no response, and I gave up looking through this avenue.

Eventually, I managed to get a letter sent to him. He replied me a month later, explaining that he was not happy to be contacted in that way, but he might have looked for someone in the same way. He then goes to point out he is upset that he is upset I ""called him out"" on the public gay forum where he found me. (I wrote a status update looking for him and mentioned 1/4th of his name, Kevin.) He exaggerated, saying I put his name on broadcast.

When he learnt that I contacted his ex-classmate and professor, he started twisting facts and exaggerating them, saying that I could potentially jeopardize their relationship (despite me having revealed nothing personal, on top of how the prof. didn't even respond), and saying that I insinuated his ex-classmate was less capable than him when I said she couldn't help me (not true, I was polite and professional) & that I lied to her that I was looking for him regarding his paper. He was manipulative and making things up, scandalizing my intentions because I somehow ""violated certain moral boundaries"" of his.

He also threatened to write to my school & workplace which he did last week. I was called up by the school - nothing happened as I didn't break any laws, but it made me really sad that he would was so willing to do that to me, yet is so deathly scared if something like that were to happen to him.

She found her birth mother before I was born, but her birth mom refused to tell her who the birth father was and left some vague hints for us to go by after she passed.

After a DNA search, we found her birth father almost a year ago. It was really hard for me to process as a 15 year old that assumed my mom had no biological family alive or known. They had the parent-child reunion and things seemed fine.

15800,Asshole,"Last night, my fiancee and I went to a semi-fancy restaurant to enjoy a nice quiet dinner together. We don't do this too often, but it feels good to get a little dressed up and have some good Italian food every once in a while. This time, she had a Groupon that was $63 off for four glasses of wine, two apps, and four main courses. We asked the waiter right at the beginning if we could order two of the main courses to go since there were only two of us, and she said no problem (not part of the assholery, I want to be clear that we weren't trying to trick anyone).

So we have a great meal, ordered our two other main courses to go, then asked for the check. This is where the potential assholery begins. Every item was accounted for on the check, and the total came out to $115 before tax. This meant we should have paid about $60 before tip when all was said and done. Not too bad. HOWEVER, we looked down at the total, and it said something like $7.32, which was just the tax. My fiancee figured we were just misunderstanding the check, as a lot of it was written by hand, so we put down the credit card. Then the receipt came back for a $7.32 total. We were surprised, to say the least, but also pretty excited at the prospect of having an extra $50 in our pocket.

Then my fiancee began to wonder if we should tell anyone. Nobody mentioned that our meal would be comped, and she was worried that someone put it in wrong and would get in trouble for it later. I said that it was fine, our waitress probably knew what she was doing, and not to look a gift horse in the mouth. We ended up not telling anybody, and my fiancee even said on the way out that she thought our waitress gave her a knowing nod as we thanked her.

So AITA (AWTA?) for not telling anyone about this potentially accidental comped meal? Also, since I think this is very relevant, we tipped $30, a 25% tip on the full amount of the check.

3461,Not the A-hole,"This was like 12 years ago but these kind of things stick with me forever.  I actually lost my job shortly after this and the belief was that it was tied to this incident. Perhaps I'm looking for peace of mind, perhaps I'm looking to be put in my place here.

I used to stock groceries for a major chain.  We'd come in after closing time and stock overnight.  Everybody would get 1 to 2 aisles.  Some aisles (like baking goods) with heavier items would be given to pairs.  I was bounced around a lot - I'd do frozen because I have a high tolerance for cold (I wore fingerless gloves handling ice cream because..im an idiot - not important). 

One co-worker I'd get paired with was a dude with a hearing disability.  Sometimes he'd get paired with a second person and sometimes he'd get a really easy aisle like greeting cards.  

One night he got placed with me on baking goods, lots of 20kg bags of sugar, flour, etc.  He had a tendency to fuck off and do his own thing. I'd constantly have to ask when I get a new pallet if anybody had seen him.  Sometimes he'd be taking an unannounced break. Sometimes he'd be in another aisle entirely rearranging things that were already stocked.  About 8 hours in I got fed up. He had unpacked about 3 cases of product all night while I was doing a ton of heavy lifting and hadnt taken even my standard lunch break because our boss was a dick and I wanted to make sure the job was done before I could relax.  I lost my shit at my supervisor.

(paraphrased, its been a while)

S: Why's there still 3 pallets to unload?

Me: I have no help.  This is a two man job. Why does (coworker) even work here if he doesn't stock shelves? 

S: You know he's deaf right?

Me: I don't care. Does deaf mean he can't open boxes? Last I checked you don't need to hear to put cocoa powder \*here\* (I slammed a tin on the shelf)  I get paid the same as he does but I'm doing 10x the work. This is bullshit.  I haven't even had a break tonight.

The rest of the night he was moved to a different aisle (i think he was putting binge items at the cashiers tils) and I was ""punished"" by working baking alone.  I barely got everything stocked - but my shifts started to reduce.  I was there for about another two weeks before a (seemingly) unrelated incident where a boss tried to grief me for not doing enough work (solo'ing another two man aisle), proceeded to unload a single pallet by himself to ""prove a point"" - to which I told him ""I'm supposed to be impressed it took you twice as long to do half what I do"" before walking out.

5859,Asshole," My mom is in her mid sixties while I’m in my late twenties. She and my dad didn’t have much growing up and when they had me and my sister, they spent what little they had to make sure we were taken care of. Even when things got better for us financially, she thought it was more sensible to save money for future needs than to splurge a bit and buy things for herself.

So now that I have a very stressful but well-paying job, I ‘spoil’ her by buying her things that I know she wants but never bought, such as fine jewelry. (She and my dad couldn’t even afford an engagement ring when they got together.) I have bought her several over the past few years; all of them are in the $3K-$7K range so they’re not the most expensive things, but my mom is always excited and happy to receive them. 

The last time I went home to visit her, my boyfriend came with me and was there when I gave my mom her third jewelry set. She was still excited and happy to receive it, but gently told me that going forward I should just save my money for my future family instead of buying her more jewelry. 

I assured her that I have separate budgets for my savings and for buying her jewelry. She said that she doesn’t want me to ‘waste’ more money on jewelry as the ones I bought for her are already enough, and it’s much more important save for the future. I answered that I don’t consider buying jewelry for her as wasting money since I know it makes her happy, and on the practical side, I’ll inherit the jewelry when she dies anyway. 

My mom laughed and said alright, and we went on with our day. But later that night when it was just me and my boyfriend, he told me that he was shocked that I would say something like that to my mom and that he doesn’t think I should say things like that again because it’s like telling my mother that I expect to ‘regain’ all the jewelry I gave to her when she dies. And that’s unfair because we don’t know what she might want to do with the jewelry, if she might want to give some to my sister or to my cousins. 

I told my boyfriend that knowing my mother, she would likely leave the jewelry to me and my sister, but if she also decides to give some to my cousins then I have no problem with that because they’re my sister and my cousins (who I am also very close to). I guess she could also donate all of them to charity if she wants, and I’d also have no problem with that. 

But realistically I just find it hard to believe that she would choose to leave the jewelry I gave her to people other than me and my sister. My mother’s whole life has been about working and saving money to make sure that she can provide the best life she can for us, I don’t see how or why that would change and she would decide to leave most of the thousands of dollars worth of jewelry I bought for her to other people.

However, earlier today I saw one of her friends (M14) tell her that her ""booty looks nice"" (pains me to write that) and my daughter essentially moves her hand in a motion to advertise it to him. Her friend responds by slapping it and grabbing it (disgusting). I later asked my daughter about this and said that she is just fooling around and having fun the way all young women do. I said that I while do support her decisions, I cannot endorse her acting the way and that it would be better if she stopped.

My eldest daughter is also on a medical track: she goes to a top 20 school and is excelling. She is a junior, and will probably get into one of the best med schools next year. 

My youngest daughter is not like us. For my eldest daughter and I, math and science come more naturally. It’s not something we need to work hard at. My youngest daughter, however, really struggles with these topics. In college, she has to study for her STEM classes for hours and hours just to get the average grade at a school that’s not very difficult. 

My daughter, to her credit, is a VERY hard worker and I admire that. However, that hard work could be placed to a field that she can really excel in instead of being a doctor; she will always struggle in med school, but she can take her talents elsewhere and become an amazing law or business major.  

The drama is that she called me yesterday and told me she had trouble getting accepted with an internship, and asked if she could work with me this summer. I basically told her she should reconsider the medical professions because she spends all day studying and she is barely average, and I don’t think she can succeed as a doctor.

So, she brings him into our office. Her son is a terror. She uses an iPad to keep him busy, but doesn't make him wear headphones.

Thankfully- I was able to get some money from my parents- $200, and I made a budget. So back when I had little to no money, I asked my roommate, who I'm really good friends with to buy some items amounting to $35 because I had to return some Amazon items and that would be my exact gift card amount. I asked her then- about two weeks ago, if it's okay to give her the gift card, and she agreed.

With those, and considering I have other small expenses that need to last me till the 27th. I made a tight budget, and then my roommate asked for the $35 dollars in cash- because she had spent too much money and she wanted to spend more without her parents knowing. I really can't afford that right now. Hopefully if the small supplies I need- find out the list of the art supplies I need on tuesday- if I have anything left over I can pay her.

I took it as a hint that maybe she's forcing me not to talk and to go enjoy my trip (she's told me to do so before). Returning home, my GF is distant. I tell her about my trip, showed her all my photos and videos. Talked about my new friends and the hookups they got into. She then tells me she didn't know I was sharing rooms with my friend. I'm deadpan confused and she tells me not to play this surprised card on her. WTF. The trip took months to plan and I reminded her of the calls to the tour group, organizing and getting on the same flights, tour dates and accommodations. She said booking doesn't mean sharing a room.  I reminded about the docs but she said she didn't want to access them because it seemed like a private. She said it seemed that I was intentionally not telling her, that I was deceitful because I should have known her jealous tendencies would need me to spell it out for her. From her perspective, it led her to think I might be hiding more. 

&#x200B;

After I went to bed separately, she sent me a text to say she thought she was enough. She forwards me one of the pics I sent her while on the trip of me and my friend out at a club and she said it was uncalled for and mean. I repeated that it didn't register to me what she was upset over at the time. I said she should have told me then but I apologized for not digging further. I'm at a loss. This morning she left me a note saying she thought she wasn't enough for me and that she was right. I want to talk to her when she gets home.

15073,Not the A-hole,"Hi All,

&#x200B;

A month ago my unlicensed (DUI) boyfriend insisted he go to the store to buy me bottle of wine to celebrate our 9 months of dating. I initially rejected the idea and he pressed it in an attempt to do a good deed, I eventually gave in. About 40 minutes later I get a frantic call from him, he had been in a car accident. When I got to the scene the car was a wreck, it was confirmed by both the police and the other driver involved that my boyfriend was NOT at fault.

&#x200B;

Well I got my insurance payout and I still owe $1200 on my loan. My boyfriend bought himself a car that I can ""use"" until he gets his license and I can't afford to get a new car and still need to pay off my loan. My boyfriend also offered to pay my loan and then I can pay him back. Problem is I feel like he should pay off my loan or buy me a new car since he put my in this shitty situation but he feels like since he wasn't at fault and I had a shitty car that he did me a favor.

&#x200B;

Should I ask my boyfriend to financially contribute?

&#x200B;

Edit:

He did receive a hefty fine ($350) and may have delayed the process on getting his license back which he was eligible to get when he wrecked, just never got around to it.

I am currently using the car to go to work and take him/pick him up from work. The insurance for the new car is also under my name since I'm using it. He offered to split insurance and pay for gas every other time.

12674,No A-holes here,"So at our wedding, my mom gave my wife a number of dresses (it's a cultural thing. her mom did too.). Unfortunately, my wife didn't like any of them and refused to wear them. Although I was a little disappointed that she didn't like my mother's gifts, I understood that they have different tastes and didn't push it. At a later time, my mom asked my wife why she never wore those dresses and asked if she'd wear them at so and so events. On two occasions my wife wore them for my mother and on a third occasion, when she really didn't want to, we told my mom that we don't want to and my mom said okay.

Now we have a event coming up and culturally, the elder of the family (in our case, my mom) would gift clothes to all their children and grandchildren etc. My mom gave clothes to all my siblings and their kids. When our turn came, I got clothes as usual but my wife got money instead. It's worth noting that my mom gave us our things separately, so that everyone would not see. When my wife asked her why she's giving her money, and not clothes, my mom said that since she figured they have different tastes (my mom figured out that the wife didn't like the clothes and that's why she wasn't wearing them), she didn't want to gift something my wife wouldn't like and felt that it's better if my wife gets something of her own choice. 

When this happened, my wife got visibly upset and remained that way for the entire duration we were with my family (we were all supposed to go out for dinner together). Everyone noticed that something was off and I whispered to her a few times not to make a scene. When we got home, she said she felt insulted by my mom and that it was passive aggressive of her to give money and not clothes. I didn't agree and felt it was quite reasonable. My wife is now upset with me too for taking my mom's side.

So AITA?

10746,Not the A-hole,"I went on a couples vacation with four other couples weeks ago. We were invited by one couple we knew but didn't know the three other couples. We are all Black, in the South, mid-20s. 

We all shared an Airbnb house and spent a few evenings of the week hanging out in the den, drinking and talking. For the most part, it was a good time and we all got to know each other well enough to have fun conversations and get to know one another well.

One evening the conversation goes into a discussion about race. One of the girls I knew previously was talking about how someone she knew was ""White mixed with Spanish"" and I respectfully explained that wasn't a thing, as you can be White and Spanish, and race and nationality are separate things. Ends up she meant Hispanic when she was saying Spanish, and the discussion evolved into me explaining the difference between race, ethnicity, and nationality - I genuinely just want my people to go out into the world knowing the difference. 

One couple was rolling their eyes at my explanations and said it wasn't that serious and that they're gonna stick to how they already say things. I just smiled and fell back. The conversation keeps going and the guy of the couple rolling their eyes - Chuck - is talking about how ""strong"" Black genes are and how if someone is mixed with Black they typically look mostly or fully Black because our DNA is ""dominant."" People are nodding their heads in agreement. I jumped in to say that wasn't how DNA works. Chuck replies with a sarcastic and dismissive comment like ""Yeah, yeah I bet"" and everyone laughs. I fell back for the rest of the evening. 

The next evening there was a conversation about educational systems by state since a few people there were originally from Mississippi and we all now lived in Texas. Before I chimed in with just general commentary, Chuck joked ""Go ahead, we know how much you like your statistics!"" It felt super malicious to me and I fell back in the conversation and went to bed early. 

Later on I asked my boyfriend if he would tell me if I was ever embarrassing myself or doing too much around other people. He assured me he would. I brought up the situation before and said I felt perhaps I was unintentionally being an asshole and failed to read the room. He said maybe I was being a bit of an asshole know it all, but it was fine and at least I didn't say anything actually wrong. I said there was a lot of ignorance I didn't bother commenting on during this vacation and it was unfair that the one conversation I spoke up, I was a know it all. We left the conversation at that. 

I've recanted this to close friends who weren't there and they all told me I did nothing wrong and that we should look to educate our own people at any given opportunity. I keep replaying it in my head over and over, wondering if I was being an asshole and feeling like if I had a do-over, I wouldn't have corrected anyone.

5148,Not the A-hole,"So my boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years, lived with each the last 2.5 years. He gets up every morning at 6:30, leaves at 7:30 to be at work for 8.  

We have a clock radio in our bedroom. Every morning at 6:30 regardless if he is working or not, the radio will go off. He likes to hear the local news.  The radio goes on at 6:30 and stays on for a whole hour. The problem is that I’m trying to sleep but the radio wakes me up.   

Now in the summer my work closes for 6 weeks. It’s unpaid so it’s not as glamorous as it sounds.  I always do housework and take care of our pets during the day so I don’t just sit and do nothing. 
I’ve always had trouble sleeping and it affects my mental health. Sometimes I will have a hard at night and can’t get to sleep until 1 or 2 in the morning.  My boyfriend on the other hand can fall asleep anywhere anytime. He likes to fall asleep listening to the news. It boggles me that he can fall asleep to the same thing that wakes him up. 
I get really annoyed and cranky in the morning because I want to sleep in a for a little bit longer.   

We are generally happy together. He’s my best friend and we do have a lot of fun together. The radio thing is probably one of the few things we fight about.   

I’ve asked him if he can go listen to the radio some where’s else but he likes listening to it in the bedroom.  He gets ready for work and listens to it at the same. I’ve tried putting  pillows over my head and using ear plugs to block out the noise but they do not help. My boyfriend gets mad when I do that. He says I I should learn to embrace it and get up early to become a morning person. I hate it so much though and it just sets me up to be in a cranky mood all day.  
I haven’t slept in past 7:00 in so long.  Today is the last day I have off before I go back to work. We had a big fight and I was in tears all before 8 this morning. 

Who’s being the asshole here? Should I just suck it up and learn to become one of those early risers? Maybe I’ll be one of those ppl to call in public radio and talk about the size of my tomatoes from the garden. 
Or should my boyfriend let his girl sleep for a few more minutes and go listen to his damn radio some where’s else?",82,187,0.94,AITA for getting annoyed with my boyfriend for listening to the news every morning,cxg0cu,2019-08-30 12:07:44,NTA,2226,AITA,"The narrator is experiencing frustration in their relationship due to their boyfriend's habit of playing the radio every morning at 6:30, which disrupts their sleep and negatively impacts their mental health.

10217,Not the A-hole,"So today during dinner I got in a discussion with my mom and sister since she told me that she was going to Bali this summer (we spent our childhood there so it’s not that weird).
I went last year when I graduated but I had to save up 2 years for that for the flight ticket and hotel and stuff.


Now I hear that my sister suddenly is going to Bali in July even though she still hasn’t bought her ticket. Last minute tickets are over €1000 while my mom was mad at me that my ticket was €700 (bought it a year upfront).


I got annoyed with the obvious favouritism and kinda snapped at them since it wasn’t fair but my mom said that I was being a bitch for snapping like that. I told her that it was unfair because my mom is paying for everything while I had to save up.

9438,Everyone Sucks,"So, Hubby and I are very different people.  I am not afraid of confrontation and have what he likes to call a ""Hard-on for justice.""  If someone is doing something jerkish or rude I am the person to stand up and say something because if no one speaks against those who are shitty they just think people around them are ok with their shit.  He avoids confrontation like the plague and would let just about anything go whether it was right or wrong.  I think if we merged together we might make a decent human being.

&#x200B;

So, anyway, the dilemma.  I am so sick and tired of people who can't park worth a damn.  And I am not talking about going out of my way to find these people, I mean the ones who park over their line and prevent me from getting into my own vehicle.  I have to get in through the passenger door.  When this happens (twice in the past two months) I leave a note that says ""You parked like an asshole"" and I leave my trash on their windshield.

&#x200B;

Nothing I leave would damage the car or the paint.  Its usually just soda bottles and a candy wrapper or two (because I have a problem).  He thinks I am being a loon, and I think that I'm doing the good work.  (The most recent time I wanted to go into the restaurant and ask employees to ask the person to move their car, but this was out of the question for hubby.)

Help us settle this please, am I an asshole?

19742,Not the A-hole,"this is my first time posting i’m sorry if this is terrible i’m on my phone. 
anyway i’ve been vegan for 4 years and i work as a takeout girl at a pizzeria in town. 
today while out on a delivery i had to stop and shop for the restaurant so i decided to get myself some vegan cheese for a pizza later. 
around 330 i put my order in (i ordered food for myself as well as my neighbors)
for myself i ordered a large margarita pizza and a large greek salad with no cheese. 
i specifically put no cheese on the ticket for my salad. 
after i put my order in i walked over to let’s call him fred, and i let him know the order i just put in was mine and gave him my bag of cheese for the pizza.
i explained to him the cheese and me being vegan. 
i got back to work and later on i realized he had made my salad but put cheese on it. 
so i went over to him and let him know there wasn’t suppose to be cheese on the salad. 
he gets enraged immediately takes a handful of the feta off my salad and throws it. 
being that this isn’t a normal way to react ever i figured he was kidding and told him “no, you need to make it fresh the cheese was already on the salad.”
he walks away and i go find a manager and explain to him what had happened. 
and that i didn’t want my food anymore. 
first he offered to make me a new salad and told me my pizza was okay. 
i told him i didn’t feel comfortable eating anything that was made for me because it clearly was made with no regard. 
he basically said he didn’t want to be out the money on the pizza. 
i told him if i was a customer that just had the experience that i had asking for my money back wouldn’t be ridiculous and it should be even less ridiculous because i work there. 
anyway i paid for the other food i bought and my manager ended up giving me back the money for my food.
